  ﻿We're Here To Help You.

Filing a claim can be an emotional time. Allstate is here to help you every step of the way, making your claims experience as simple and convenient as possible. With one of the largest teams of claims professionals in the country and 24/7 claims support, we'll work to help you get back to normal quickly. You can file your claim online quickly and easily by logging in to My Account. Once you're logged in, you can start your claim and track its progress.


Log in to file a claim 


Register for My Account


If you haven’t registered for My Account, you can  still file a claim online. Flood claims  are handled differently, but you can still file a  flood claim online.


More Ways To File A Claim.

To make filing a claim quick and convenient, Allstate provides you with many ways to file a claim:

Access 24/7 claims service by calling 1-800-ALLSTATE.
Start your claim using the Allstate® Mobile app. 
Report your claim by contacting your agent.



What To Expect During The Claims Process.

Knowing what to expect when you file a claim can help make the process easier to navigate. Though different types of claims are handled a little differently, most Allstate claims follow the same basic steps.



Step 1: File your claim.
Once you file a claim, you'll get a claim number that will help you track your claim.







Step 2: Investigate claim.
We may need to investigate the details of your loss. If so, one of our claims professionals will walk you through the process and answer all of your questions or concerns.







Step 3: Evaluate damage.
A professional will assess the damage, determine what needs to be repaired or replaced and provide you with an estimate.







Step 4: Review estimate.
Once you've received an estimate of the damage, your claims adjuster will discuss your settlement based on your policy provisions, terms and coverage.







Step 5: Wrap up your claim.
Your claims adjuster may send you any applicable payments and can answer any questions you may have.






Staying organized can help you keep track of your claim. Writing your claim number on important documents is a good tip to keep in mind. If you have an auto claim, the auto insurance claim worksheet can help you keep everything straight.

For over 170 years, New York Life and its subsidiaries have helped ensure the financial well-being of families and communities with a variety of insurance, retirement, and investment products. And we maintain the highest ratings currently awarded to any life insurer for financial strength.* But more importantly, each of our insurance policies represents our promise to pay.  

And we always have, and always will, stand behind every promise.




Term Life Insurance
This is the simplest way to provide for loved ones in the event of your death during a set “term” you select (usually 10, 15, or 20 years).





Whole Life Insurance
In addition to lifelong, guaranteed protection, this builds cash value year after year—which can help with tuition, retirement, or other needs.**





Long-Term Care Insurance
Learn more about investing in your well-being with long-term care coverage.





Annuities
Annuities help grow your savings over time, and can convert that money into guaranteed pension-like income for the rest of your life.





Mutual Funds
A mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities, mutual funds can help diversify your investments—without the need to hand-pick them yourself.





Group Membership
Our coverage for members of specific organizations (such as AARP) currently insures over 600 groups totalling over 1.5 million people.





Business Solutions
Business owner? Offer insurance to employees, buy insurance on key executives, or fund buy-sell, succession, or deferred comp agreements.













Behind every product and every promise we make is a passionate and committed team of people.
