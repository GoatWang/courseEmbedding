                Landmark Partners: Investment Manager Highlight            


    By Sean Ross | March 22, 2016 — 4:19 AM EDT    






Share


















































Landmark Partners ranks among the top private-equity real estate investment companies in the United States. As a fund of funds investor, Landmark Partners doesn't operate in the same manner or offer the same sort of products as many other investment managers. Instead, Landmark is a highly specialized firm that targets a very concentrated number of investors to purchase a narrow range of assets.
Company Overviews
The company was founded in 1989 by Standley Alfeld. Alfeld served as chief executive and chairman until just before his death in 2005. The company launched in Connecticut and remains headquartered there, though it has offices in Boston, New York and London. The firm is a pioneer of secondary fund investments, offering liquidity to other companies or investors involved in venture capital, mezzanine, private equity buyouts and real estate limited partnerships.
Standard investments are staked out for a three- to five-year period. The secondary market is full of real estate investment trusts (REITs), joint ventures, commingled funds and private real estate funds, and that is where Landmark Partners chooses to focus.
Landmark's appeal is linked to its hyper-diversified holdings, shorter investment cycles, due diligence and better acquisition pricing. Investors in Landmark Partners realize extra liquidity through an option to sell interests prior to maturity.
Executive Staff and Investment Team
Landmark Partners divides its major investment team into two groups: private equity and real estate. The 24-member private equity team is headed by Francisco L. Borges and Tm Haviland. Borges is chairman, managing partner and CEO at Landmark. He previously served as managing director of GE Capital's Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Borges sits on the board of trustees of the Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network. Haviland is president and COO at Landmark and dates his tenure back to 1985, before its first acquisition and before the modern company reorganized in 1989.
The real estate team, also headed by Borges and Haviland, has only 19 members and includes many other crossovers from the private equity team. Other key players include Antoinette C. Lazarus, chief compliance officer at Landmark and a former vice president at Prudential Financial; and Geoffrey G. Mullen, a managing director and former head of institutional business at Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners.
Asset Classes
The single broad asset class covered by Landmark Partners is real estate, although its focus is more specialized. Secondary real estate investments often cover pools of properties, huge commercial buildings, industrial parks and public lands. Landmark largely pursues these investments by investing in others' transactions.
One such example is Landmark's 15th fund, Landmark Equity Partners XV, which closed in January 2015 after attracting $3.25 billion from major investors. Chief investors included the Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System and the Louisiana Firefighters' Retirement System.
Landmark prefers to work in the United States, although it does handle foreign funds through the London offices. Investors outside of the United States tend to come from the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Asia and select countries in the Middle East.
Investment Products and Services
Between 1989 and 2016, Landmark Partners formed 29 funds with a combined capitalization greater than $10 billion that cover approximately 15,600 underlying investments. In 1996, Landmark became the first secondary market investor to form a real estate chartered fund to purchase a portfolio of commingled fund interests from an institutional investor. Institutional investment offerings usually target public and corporate pensions, insurance companies and other investment managers.
Landmark's fund of fund investments utilize one of two strategies. The first is called a "next generation" strategy, with an emphasis on smaller, spun-out funds and first-time entrants. The second is an "opportunity" strategy, which targets larger, highly recognized fund sponsors.

record activity on our Sites so that we understand how you use our Sites enabling us to better tailor our content, services and marketing to your needs;
collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site; and
gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a 
                    “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county 
                    and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements

Email tracking: So that we can better understand our users' needs, we track responses to our emails - for example, to see which links are the 
                most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are 
                small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links 
                within the message. Any other purposes for which Euromoney wishes to use your personal data will be notified to you and your personal data will not be used 
                for any such purpose without obtaining your prior consent.

                This will include transfers to Institutional Investor Inc. in the US (and Institutional Investor Inc. will collect some data directly from you, in relation to the 
                Sites which it operates) and to third parties who provide us with email and marketing services. Where we conduct any transfers we will take all steps reasonably 
                necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

unlawful destruction or accidental loss

All our employees, contractors and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and 
                are associated with the processing of your personal data, are obliged to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out 
                the services they are performing for us. We also give you the option of using a secure transmission method to send us personal data identifiers, such as 
                credit card details and bank account number. How to Access, Update and Erase your Personal Information

Market Commentary


Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.
