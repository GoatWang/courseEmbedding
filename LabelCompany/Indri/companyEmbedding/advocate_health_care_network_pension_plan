Pension Plan - Overview




Advocate's Pension Plan is another reason Advocate continues to earn recognition as a great place to work. The Advocate Pension Plan helps associates save for tomorrow by rewarding them for their work today.  Advocate contributes funds to the Pension Plan on your behalf based on what you earn today; pension benefits are then paid in retirement.

			  The  Advocate Pension Plan is a cash-balance retirement plan that is funded and 
			invested by Advocate. For each calendar year in which you work 1,000 hours, 
			you'll receive a contribution to a cash balance "account" based on your 
			eligible pay. Contributions in your account earn a guaranteed interest rate 
			that is determined at the beginning of each year. 

			It takes no effort on your part to participate in the plan; Advocate funds this 
			benefit entirely on your behalf. Highlights of the plan provisions are 
			described below.

			You may access information about your account balance in the Advocate Pension 
			Plan using Advocate Benefits Service Center. You need your PIN to access your personal 
			account data.

Advocate Health Care Network
Stapleton v. Advocate Health Care Networks and Subsidiaries, Case No. 14-01873United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
 
Case Overview
Plaintiffs allege that Advocate Health Care Network, an Illinois non-profit corporation and the largest healthcare provider in Illinois, operating 12 hospitals and more than 250 healthcare facilities, is improperly claiming an exemption from ERISA protections for its defined benefit pension plan (the “Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan” or “Pension Plan”). Defendants claim that the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan is a “church plan” and thus not subject to ERISA regulation.
Plaintiffs allege multiple reasons why the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan cannot properly claim an exemption from ERISA as a church plan, including that Advocate Health Care Network is not a church or a convention or association of churches, but rather is a non-profit corporation claiming some affiliation with the United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and that the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan was not established by a church or a convention or association of churches.
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are also violating ERISA by, among other things:

underfunding the Pension Plan;
requiring participants to complete five years of vesting service to become fully vested in their accrued benefits in the Pension Plan;
failing to furnish Plaintiffs or any member of the proposed Class with a Summary Plan Description, Pension Benefit Statement, Summary Annual Report, Notification of Failure to Meet Minimum Funding, or Funding Notice;
failing to file annual reports with the Secretary of Labor; and
failing to establish an appropriate trust to hold the assets of the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan.

Case Status
On December 31, 2014, Judge Edmond E. Chang held that the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan was not entitled to ERISA’s church plan exemption as a matter of law. Advocate appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and oral argument was held on September 18, 2015.
On March 17, 2016, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Plaintiffs’ favor and held that under the plain language of ERISA, “a plan must . . .  be established by a church.” Because no church established the Advocate Health Care Network’s Pension Plan, Advocate is ineligible for the church plan exemption from ERISA. Read the full update here.
On July 15, 2016, Defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to accept an appeal of the Seventh Circuit’s decision and on December 2, 2016, the Supreme Court granted Defendants’ motion.

Retirement Savings Plan-401(k) Plan




The Retirement Savings Plan 401(k) is a great way to put what you earn today to work for you. The 401(k) helps you save for tomorrow so you can plan for a secure retirement.
Your contributions to the plan are made through convenient automatic payroll deductions. Contributions must be made in whole increments of 1% of eligible pay.
There are two ways you can save through the 401(k) Plan:

Traditional 401(k) savings are deducted from your eligible pay on a pre-tax basis, reducing your current taxable income and the income taxes you pay. When you receive a distribution from these contributions, you pay taxes on your original contributions and any investment gains these contributions have earned over the years.
Roth 401(k) savings are deducted from your eligible pay on an after-tax basis, which means they are taxed as current income. When you receive a distribution from these contributions, you pay no taxes on your original contributions (as you�ve already paid taxes on these amounts) and you pay no taxes on any investment gains these contributions have earned over the years.

You can save with Traditional 401(k) savings or Roth 401(k) savings�or a combination of both. The choice is yours!
You can save up to 75% of your eligible pay through the plan each year (up to a specified dollar maximum set by the IRS). Starting in the year you reach age 50 and you will have a higher annual limit and can start making an additional catch-up contribution to the plan each year. (You will need to adjust your annual contribution percentage to maximize your annual retirement savings.) These limits apply to Traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k) contributions combined.
Current contribution limits are available on here.
For every dollar you save (up to 6% of your pay), Advocate will contribute an additional 50� up to the maximum of 3% of your eligible pay (or up to the maximum amount a plan participant can receive from Advocate under federal regulations, if less).
To receive Advocate�s matching contribution, you must work at least 1,000 hours during the year and be employed by Advocate on the last day of the year for which the contribution is made. Any matching contribution you�re eligible to receive for the year will be credited to your account by February 15th of the following year.
Note: If you retire at or after age 55 or if you die before year end, the 1,000-work-hours and last-day-worked requirements will not apply and the matching contribution � based on your contributions to-date � will be credited to your account the next pay period following your retirement, death or disability.
For example: How Your Savings Add Up Each Year
Here's an example of how the Advocate 401(k) Plan works for an associate who earns $55,000 per year, saves 6% of pre-tax pay and receives the maximum matching contribution:


Your contribution � 6% of $55,000
$3,300


Advocate matching contribution � 3% of $55,000
+  $1,650


Total annual 401(k) Plan savings
$4,950


Investing Your Accounts
How you invest your Advocate 401(k) Plan account is an important decision, which you should make carefully. It is your responsibility to thoroughly review all the information provided to you by the fund sponsor prior to making your investment choices. Advocate cannot advise you how to invest or take responsibility for the performance of any investment fund.

Appeals Court Rules Advocate Health Care Network is Not a Church Plan Exempt from ERISA Laws | Cohen Milstein

Appeals Court Rules Advocate Health Care Network is Not a Church Plan Exempt from ERISA Laws







March 17, 2016 

(WASHINGTON D.C. - March 17, 2016) A federal appeals court has ruled that a pension plan established by Illinois-based Advocate Health Care Network does not qualify as a “church plan” exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the federal pension law that requires such plans to be fully funded and provides employees with certain rights related to benefit entitlements, according to Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, which represents the plaintiffs in the case.
The unanimous decision by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirms the decision by Judge Edmond Chang, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and holds that a plan established by a church-affiliated organization, such as Advocate Health Care Network, is not exempt from ERISA under the law’s church plan exemption. 
“We are pleased with the Seventh Circuit Court’s decision, which upholds the rights of Advocate Health Care pension fund participants to a fully funded pension plan and to other federal  protections designed to insure that the money is there when workers need it for their retirement,” said plaintiffs’ co-lead counsel Karen L. Handorf, of Cohen Milstein. “This and the Third Circuit’s ruling in the St. Peter’s Healthcare case send a clear message to these healthcare systems that they cannot get away with denying employees their rightful retirement benefits by claiming that they are church plans exempt from employee retirement fund laws.”
Writing for the panel, Judge Ilana Diamond Rovner highlighted that ERISA is a remedial statute that should be liberally construed in favor of protecting employee benefit plan participants. The Court also expressed concern that employees of religiously-affiliated hospitals in unregulated pension plans could be “left with severely underfunded and uninsured pension plans” if their employer encountered financial trouble.  In a separate concurrence, Judge Michael S. Kanne emphasized that the court’s interpretation of the ERISA church plan exemption “does not compel church-affiliated organizations to operate in a way that violates their religious beliefs.”
The March 17, 2016, Seventh Circuit decision concurs with the recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that affirmed a lower court decision that the pension plan established by St. Peter’s Healthcare System, headquartered in New Jersey, did not qualify as a church plan exempt from ERISA.  The panel also cites the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California decision that San Francisco-based Dignity Health's pension plan does not qualify for the church plan exemption.  Plaintiffs in both cases are represented by Cohen Milstein and their co-counsel Keller Rohrback, L.L.P.
Advocate Health Care operates 12 hospitals and more than 250 other inpatient and outpatient healthcare facilities, employing 33,000 people throughout northern and central Illinois. 
The plaintiffs, Maria Stapleton, Judith Lukas, Sharon Roberts and Antoine Fox, all past and current employees with vested claims to benefits under the Advocate Health Care retirement plan, filed their class action claims against the health care system in district court on March 17, 2014. They allege that Advocate has not managed the retirement plan in accordance with ERISA standards, and has harmed plan participants by requiring an improperly long five years of service to become fully vested, funding the plan at insufficient levels, placing the plan’s assets in a trust that does not meet statutory requirements, failing to file reports and other notices related to benefits and funding, and other ERISA violations.
Because the Court has determined that the Advocate Health Care Network plan is not an exempt church plan, it must now comply with all of ERISA’s protections which require, among other things, that the plan be fully funded. 
The plaintiffs in Stapleton et al. v. Advocate Health Care Networkare represented by Karen L. Handorf, Michelle C. Yau, and Mary J. Bortscheller of Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, and Lynn Lincoln Sarko, Ron Kilgard, Erin M. Riley, and Matthew M. Gerend of Keller Rohrback L.L.P., and James B. Zouras and Ryan F. Stephan of Stephan Zouras LLP.

Supreme Court rules in favor of Advocate Health Care in pension case

The U.S. Supreme Court  ruled Monday that Advocate Health Care and  two other religiously affiliated hospital systems  don't have to follow a federal law designed to protect employee pensions.The  justices ruled unanimously  in favor of Advocate, with the exception of new Justice Neil Gorsuch, who did not take part in the decision.The ruling, which reversed a lower court's decision, will save a number of religiously affiliated hospitals in Illinois and across the country from having to potentially pour more money into funding and supporting their pension systems. But it also means  employees of those hospitals may not enjoy the same protections as  employees of many other businesses  when it comes to their pensions.Employees and former employees of Advocate  brought the lawsuit in 2014.  The ruling also applied to two lawsuits over the issue brought against St. Peter's Healthcare System in New Jersey and San Francisco-headquartered Dignity Health, which has hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada.

The federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, requires that pension plans be insured and sufficiently funded, among other things. But Downers Grove-based Advocate had argued, along with other religiously affiliated hospitals, that it shouldn't have to follow the law when it comes to pensions for its 35,000 employees because its pension plan is technically a "church plan," and church plans are exempt from the law.Advocate, which has 11 hospitals and a two-campus children's hospital, is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ. Advocate had argued that Congress allows  church plans to be exempt from the federal law in order to limit government intrusion into church activities. Advocate has said its pension plan is fully funded."The Court's ruling sets a precedent for the dozens of other cases being heard at varying jurisdictions throughout the country," Advocate said in a statement Monday. "We agree with the Supreme Court's decisive interpretation of the law and will continue to operate our plan in the best interest of our associates to ensure they have a successful transition to retirement."

The employees and former employees who brought the lawsuit had argued  the exemptions weren't meant to extend to "giant businesses" such as Advocate. They also argued that allowing Advocate and other hospitals to get around the law gave them an unfair advantage over competitors. Karen Handorf, an attorney for the employees,  called the decision "disappointing" in a statement Monday. She said attorneys will continue to fight in court to make sure the "church plan exemption" is claimed only when appropriate."The decision avoids deciding whether large non-profit hospital systems meet the requirements for the exemption," Handorf said in the statement. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State warned that the ruling could "jeopardize the financial security of hundreds of thousands of workers." "The Supreme Court has put the retirement of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk," Richard Katskee, legal director of Americans United, said in a news release. "These hospitals now have the right to use their religious affiliation to pocket hundreds of millions of dollars that they promised to their employees as retirement funds and pensions."Americans United had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, among other groups, siding with the employees. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, said an employee pension plan doesn't have to have been originally established by a church in order for it to qualify as a church plan that is exempt from the federal law. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also wrote an opinion, in which she agreed with the court's decision but said she was "troubled by the outcome of these cases." She wrote that despite the health systems' relationships to churches, they can operate for-profit subsidiaries, employ thousands of workers and earn billions of dollars in revenue, meaning they "bear little resemblance to those Congress considered when enacting the 1980 amendment to the church plan definition." Advocate isn't the only Illinois hospital that has been in court over the issue. Presence Health, which has 11 Illinois hospitals; OSF HealthCare, which has 10 Illinois hospitals; Sinai Health System's Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago; and Franciscan Health, which has 12 hospitals in Indiana and two in Illinois, have also been to court over the matter. lschencker@chicagotribune.comTwitter @lschencker

A new case on the U.S. Supreme Court’s docket could potentially involve millions of American employees and lead to billions of dollars’ worth of litigation. The justices’ decision could affect the viability of religiously affiliated orphanages, hospitals, schools, and nursing homes, and it could also threaten the financial security of a generation of their workers, fast heading toward retirement.On its face, Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton and the two other cases it’s consolidated with may seem boring—after all, they’re about federal regulations on pension plans for church-affiliated hospitals. But these cases are actually the culmination of a new, vicious fight over the rights of employers that are loosely affiliated with religious institutions, and how they should have to pay retirement benefits to their employees in accordance with federal law.

What Lies Ahead for the Supreme Court in a Trump Administration?
The three consolidated cases in question seem likely to turn on something deceptively simple: the single word “established.” In 1974, Congress passed a law called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, which, among other things, created guidelines for defined-benefit retirement plans, otherwise known as pensions. The two most relevant requirements in these cases have to do with good planning and risk mitigation: Employers have to put money into their employees’ retirement plans in a responsible way, so that they can afford to pay out big sums of money once those employees get old. But, if a company is in financial trouble when it comes time to pay out the promised benefits, there’s a safety net: ERISA established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, which is effectively a government insurance agency for underfunded pension plans.These rules do not apply to houses of worship. Benefit plans “established and maintained” by these groups are exempt. The reasons for this are a bit opaque, said Norman Stein, a professor at Drexel University’s Kline School of Law, but an early draft of the law suggests Congress “didn’t want churches to have to open their books to the government.” Legislators also figured religious groups weren’t the problem: “People felt that it’s the church—it’s not going to let its plan fail and screw its employees,” he said. “Some of the writing about the statute has speculated that this was a reason, too—churches are moral institutions that are going to stand behind their promise [to pay for people’s pensions], because that’s what religions do.”When ERISA first passed, it wasn’t clear whether this exception would apply long-term to religious organizations that weren’t houses of worship, like Jewish day schools or Catholic hospitals. In 1980, Congress amended the law to clarify that religiously affiliated groups can also maintain what’s called a “church plan,” so long as they satisfy certain requirements. For years, the IRS allowed religiously affiliated groups to offer these “church plans” without much controversy. Since 1982, according the hospitals’ Supreme Court petition, it has sent over 500 letters granting ERISA exemptions to organizations as diverse as the Princeton Theological Seminary and the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns.Three years ago, employees across the country began filing lawsuits claiming that these organizations shouldn’t be exempt, after all. Current and former employees of three health-care systems filed suit against their employers: Dignity Health in California and Saint Peter’s Healthcare System in New Jersey, which are both associated with the Roman Catholic Church; and Advocate Health Care Network in Illinois, which is jointly associated with the the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ. This is where everything comes back to “established”: Because these pension plans weren’t “established” by actual churches, the employees argue, they shouldn’t be exempt from ERISA.Under church plans, a “[pension] promise is only as good as the word of the hospital.”The conflict matters for a few reasons. First, both sides arguably stand to lose incredible amounts of money. The Pension Rights Center, which supports the hospital employees, has identified at least three cases of allegedly failed church plans. When the owners of St. Anthony Medical Center in Illinois terminated one of its pension plans in 2012, the president and CEO told employees she was “very sorry for this surprising and disappointing news.” In 2013, the president and CEO of St. Mary’s Hospital in New Jersey wrote a letter to employees stating that “there simply are no funds remaining in the retirement plan’s trust.” And something similar happened last month at the now-closed St. James Hospital in New Jersey—the liability in that case is still murky.Because these plans were not insured by the PBGC, they have left or may leave huge numbers of workers with less retirement money than they were promised. Hospital employees and their allies argue that church plans are a way for large employers to avoid complying with federal regulations—ones that were explicitly put in place to protect workers. Under church plans, a “[pension] promise is only as good as the word of the hospital,” Stein said. “If the hospital gets into financial trouble and the plan is not well-funded, you’re not going to get paid your benefits.”But if these hospitals lose, they will also face intense financial consequences—and so will other religiously affiliated organizations across the country. Two appellate courts, the Third and Seventh Circuits, recently ruled against them, and “it is hard to overstate the burden and havoc these two decisions have created,” the hospitals wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court. If the lower-court rulings are affirmed, “this will mean renegotiating contracts with employees whose benefits are covered by collective-bargaining agreements, revamping benefit structures, redesigning pension-funding policies, and overhauling budget plans.”There will also be future consequences: Under ERISA, employers are required to pay premiums to the PBGC and fund their pension plans at certain levels. When the law was created, “There was … a feeling that these kinds of church groups could not afford the cost of an ERISA plan,” said Howard Shapiro, a lawyer at Proskauer Rose in New Orleans, who has defended a number of hospitals that are being sued over their church plans. If these organizations are retroactively forced to comply with ERISA, they could face significant, and potentially ruinous, financial hardships.The irony is that both religious groups and their employees could end up suffering if these hospitals lose at the Supreme Court. The church plans at issue “are still the old style of defined-benefit plans which everyone wishes they still had but don’t have anymore,” said Colleen Medill, a law professor at the University of Nebraska and counsel at the Koley Jessen law firm. “If [the hospitals] lose, and they pay whatever they have to pay in damages, they will probably, as a pure financial decision, freeze or terminate these plans and move over to a defined-contribution kind of plan.”Defined-contribution plans typically include options like 401 (k) features, which have become much more popular in recent years—if you look at graphs of the number of organizations that have switched over to these plans, “they kind of look like the Nike swoosh,” said Medill. The reason behind this rise is straightforward: Defined-contribution plans shift the burden of bad economic times from employers to employees. A 401 (k) plan is great when the stock market is doing well, but “when the market goes down, maybe you don’t love that 401(k) plan so much because you bear the risk of market volatility,” Medill said. “In terms of retirement-income security, is it better to have an account that goes up and down every day with the market? Or is, it better to know that when I retire, I’ll get $3000 a month for life?”In some ways, it’s surprising that all these issues are coming out now—ERISA has been around for 42 years, and Congress clarified the nature of church plans in 1980. In part, the delay is due the nature of retirement plans: People pay in over a long period of time, and they might not realize the consequences of being part of an uninsured pension plan until they’re about to hit 65 and realizing they don’t have the money they need to live.“Churches didn’t write a letter saying, ‘By the way, we just decided to screw you.’”But the delay also has to do with the way the IRS has dealt with religiously affiliated groups, Stein argued. “This went on for as long as it did [because] there was no regulation, no formal rule-making,” he said. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, a large number of religiously affiliated organizations won permission from the IRS to convert their pension plans into church plans. There were big incentives to do so: If they won church-plan status, the PBGC would refund a portion of the premiums they had paid in the past, which meant anything from a few thousand dollars to millions. Groups would get a private-letter ruling from the IRS, a form of guidance that does not set precedents for other taxpayers. But until 2011, when the agency began facing media scrutiny for what one amicus brief called “church-plan conversions,” organizations weren’t required to tell employees about the changes to their benefits plans. “By and large, employees didn’t even know it was happening—churches didn’t write a letter saying, ‘By the way, we just decided to screw you,’” said Stein.Around the time a handful of plans began failing, a wave of lawsuits began—dozens have been filed since 2013, according to court documents. “There’s a whole movement among class-action lawyers where they see the potential to sue a very large plan and collect a lot of money in attorney’s fees and have some benefits for the employees,” said Medill. If the hospital employees win, “these employers are going to have to come up with a lot of money to fund these plans to come into compliance with ERISA.”Not all churches and religious organizations dislike ERISA—in fact, any house of worship or religiously affiliated group can voluntarily choose to be subject to the law. “There are reasons to do that—namely to take advantage of federal preemption of state laws,” said Medill. ERISA limits the scope of what plaintiffs can win in a lawsuit, for example—if they operate in states that are more permissive, employers might find ERISA’s limited legal liability attractive. But that’s not what’s happening in these cases. “The real issue here is the funding requirement for the pension plans. If the plans were subject to ERISA, the employers would have to pay a lot more to fund these plans,” Medill said.It’s hard to know how extensive the consequences of this Supreme Court decision could be. But they may not just be financial—Shapiro also sees the potential for religious-freedom conflicts. Under their church plans, religiously affiliated organizations can choose how they invest their money—pacifists can avoid putting money behind ammunitions companies, for example, or pro-life faiths can steer clear of investments related to abortion. Because ERISA imposes specific investment responsibilities on employers, Shapiro said, compliance “[could] actually conflict with some religious principles that are very important to these entities.”These cases don’t break down along clear lines of good vs. evil. Various sides are trying to protect people who have compelling, conflicting needs, including employees who want to be able to survive retirement and hospitals with missions to follow their teachings and serve the poor. Everyone involved likely has some religious stake—many people who spend their lives working for religious hospitals are probably just as faithful as the organizations that employ them. There’s only one group that will really walk away victorious: As Medill put it, “This will be good for employment for ERISA lawyers.”

John McCain's Incongruous Speech


David A. Graham




The Arizona senator delivered an impassioned critique of partisanship, haste, and win-at-all-costs legislation, just moments after casting a vote to debate a bill that exemplifies all three.

It was a day of contradictions for John McCain: Returning from his own sickbed, he flew into Washington to vote to open debate on a bill that could strip others of their coverage. Met with a standing ovation on the Senate floor, he was also denounced fiercely for his vote in favor of debate, which allowed the bill to move forward after Vice President Pence broke a 50-50 tie.
And then there was the speech he delivered immediately after the vote. It was a surreal moment: a stemwinder denouncing fight-for-every-inch gamesmanship, hasty procedures, closed-door wrangling, and legislation that puts partisan gain over helping citizens, delivered moments after McCain cast the deciding vote to forward a bill that embodied every one of those tendencies.

Bill Browder's Testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee


Rosie Gray




“I hope that my story will help you understand the methods of Russian operatives in Washington and how they use U.S. enablers to achieve major foreign policy goals without disclosing those interests,” Browder writes.

The financier Bill Browder has emerged as an unlikely central player in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Sergei Magnitsky, an attorney Browder hired to investigate official corruption, died in Russian custody in 2009. Congress subsequently imposed sanctions on the officials it held responsible for his death, passing the Magnitsky Act in 2012. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government retaliated, among other ways, by suspending American adoptions of Russian children.
Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who secured a meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, was engaged in a campaign for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, and raised the subject of adoptions in that meeting. That’s put the spotlight back on Browder’s long campaign for Kremlin accountability, and against corruption—a campaign whose success has irritated Putin and those around him.

Trump's Mistake at the Boy Scout Jamboree


Yoni Appelbaum




The president addressed the quadrennial gathering like a campaign rally—talking to a group devoted to service as if it valued self-interest.

Donald Trump continued his ongoing tour of cherished American institutions on Monday night, delivering yet another jarringly partisan speech to an apolitical audience—this one, comprising tens of thousands still too young to vote.
During the campaign, his performance at the Al Smith dinner—where presidential candidates roast their rivals and themselves every four years—devolved into overt attacks on his opponent. Shortly after his election, he stunned CIA employees by delivering a campaign-style stump speech before the agency’s Memorial Wall. On Saturday, he surprised the crowd of uniformed personnel at the commissioning of the USS Gerald R. Ford by imploring them to lobby Congress in support of his agenda.

The Strange, Slow-Motion Defenestration of Jeff Sessions


David A. Graham




Why is President Trump badmouthing his attorney general, why doesn’t he just fire him, and what does he hope to accomplish by pushing him out?

Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III has spent much of his career making enemies. The Alabaman’s strident views have won him plenty of detractors, from civil-rights activists to fellow members of the Senate. But in Donald Trump, Sessions believed he had finally found a champion and fellow traveler. Instead, it seems Sessions has found his most formidable enemy yet.
Trump is now on his second consecutive day of publicly humiliating the attorney general on Twitter, following an interview with The New York Times last week in which he said he wished he’d never appointed Sessions. The attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from investigation into Russian interference in the election infuriated Trump, who has repeatedly tried to end the investigation, including by firing FBI Director James Comey. Instead, Comey’s firing resulted in the appointment of a special counsel to take the case. Here’s Trump’s latest broadside against Sessions:

Snopes Faces an Ugly Legal Battle


Alexis C. Madrigal




The internet’s favorite fact-checkers are caught in a messy dispute.

On Monday, the editorial staff of Snopes.com wrote a short plea for help. The post said that the site needed money to fund its operations because another company that Snopes had contracted with “continues to essentially hold the Snopes.com web site hostage.”
“Our legal team is fighting hard for us, but, having been cut off from all revenue, we are facing the prospect of having no financial means to continue operating the site and paying our staff (not to mention covering our legal fees) in the meanwhile,” the note continued.
It was a shocking message from a website that’s been around for more than 20 years—and that’s become a vital part of internet infrastructure in the #fakenews era. The site’s readers have responded. Already, more than $92,000 has been donated to a GoFundMe with a goal of $500,000.

Why Hasn’t ISIS Nuked America Yet? 


Graeme Wood




There is plenty of reason to be confident that if ISIS could reliably and easily make a dirty bomb, they would do so.

In the last three years, I have not spent much time wondering whether ISIS has access to radioactive material. I know they have had access, because I had a hand in getting it to them.
In 2005, while working for an air cargo company in Mosul, I delivered a large wooden box, marked for consignment to the University of Mosul. To fly it in, we needed a special plane, an Antonov-12, whose cargo hold was cavernous compared to our usual 727s and DC-8s. The box contained, according to its air waybill, radiological imaging equipment for the university’s teaching hospital. The next day, workers from the hospital met me at my office, and I gently forklifted the crate into their truck. The load seemed off-balance, and I winced when I heard a corner of the box splinter as we strapped it down. But they drove away, and unless that million-dollar piece of medical equipment fell off the back of the truck and ended up strewn across the road, it probably made it safely to the hospital, where it was captured by ISIS nine years later.

Why Trump Might Fire Robert Mueller 


Peter Beinart




President Trump is reportedly considering drastic action to end the Russia investigation.

Why do Donald Trump and his advisors keep floating the possibility of firing Robert Mueller, an act that would spark the greatest constitutional crisis since Watergate, perhaps the greatest in modern American history?
Partly, it’s simple rage. Mueller threatens Trump. And when Trump sees someone as a threat, he tries to discredit and destroy them—conventional norms of propriety, decency and legality be damned.
But there’s another, more calculated, reason. Trump and his advisors may genuinely believe that firing Mueller is a smart move. And if you put morality aside, and see the question in nakedly political terms, they may be right.
The chances that Mueller will uncover something damning seem very high. Trump has already admitted to firing former FBI Director James Comey over the Russia investigation. Donald Trump Jr. has already admitted to welcoming the opportunity to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from people he believed were representatives of the Russian government. Even if Mueller doesn’t accuse anyone of a crime, he’s likely to paint a brutal picture. And that’s just on the question of election collusion and obstruction of justice. If Mueller uses Russia to segue into Trump’s business dealings, who knows what he might find. An all-star team of legal and financial sleuths, with unlimited time and money, and the ability to subpoena documents and people, have been let loose on the affairs of a man whose own autobiographer called him a “sociopath.” No wonder Trump is scared.

The Algorithm That Makes Preschoolers Obsessed With YouTube


Adrienne LaFrance




Surprise eggs and slime are at the center of an online realm that’s changing the way the experts think about human development.

Toddlers crave power. Too bad for them, they have none. Hence the tantrums and absurd demands. (No, I want this banana, not that one, which looks identical in every way but which you just started peeling and is therefore worthless to me now.)
They just want to be in charge! This desire for autonomy clarifies so much about the behavior of a very small human. It also begins to explain the popularity of YouTube among toddlers and preschoolers, several developmental psychologists told me.
If you don’t have a 3-year-old in your life, you may not be aware of YouTube Kids, an app that’s essentially a stripped-down version of the original video blogging site, with videos filtered by the target audience’s age. And because the mobile app is designed for use on a phone or tablet, kids can tap their way across a digital ecosystem populated by countless videos—all conceived with them in mind.

The Swedish Novel That Imagines a Dystopia for the Childless


Sophie Gilbert




Ninni Holmqvist’s 2009 book “The Unit,” newly reissued, imagines a world in which people who haven’t procreated are forced to make a different—ultimate—contribution to society.

“It was more comfortable than I could have imagined,” is how The Unit begins, with Dorrit, a single, impoverished 50-year-old woman picked up from her home in a metallic red SUV and transported to a luxury facility constructed by the government for people just like her. Her new, two-room apartment is bright and spacious, “tastefully decorated,” inside a complex that includes a theater, art studios, a cinema, a library, and gourmet restaurants. For the first time, Dorrit is surrounded by likeminded people and included rather than ostracized. At the Second Reserve Bank Unit for biological material, she’s one among a community of people who couldn’t—or didn’t want to—have children.
The cost is that, for the remaining four or five years of her life, Dorrit will be subjected to medical testing and will donate her organs one by one until her final, fatal donation. The Unit’s author, the Swedish writer Ninni Holmqvist, has imagined a society fixated on capital, but in human form. Those who have children or who work in fields like teaching and healthcare are seen as enabling growth; the childless and creative types like Dorrit, a writer, are deemed “dispensable,” removed, and forced to make their own biological contributions. The unit itself is a fantasy of government welfare for aging citizens (it offers delicious meals, culture, and companionship), but with a particularly sharp twist.

The Bankruptcies That Would Follow an Obamacare Repeal


Annie Lowrey




Without insurance, millions of Americans will find themselves in dire financial straits as they struggle to pay for medical services.

Senate Republicans are working to pass legislation scaling back government support for health coverage, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for a vote on Tuesday to begin debate on a bill whose precise contents remain unknown. “Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law,” President Trump said on Monday, referring to Obamacare. “But so far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.”
Even without more specifics on the details of the legislation, one thing is clear: The options under consideration would increase the number of uninsured by 15 to 30 million over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. A consequence of this will be not only a loss of access to medical services, but an increase in financial crises for millions of American families. Insurance, after all, is also a financial product, protecting people from economic ruin.

Employee Benefits / ERISA 





Advocate Health Care Church Plan Litigation











Summary of the Lawsuit
This lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois (1:14-cv-01873), alleges that the non-profit healthcare corporation Advocate Health Care Network and Subsidiaries (“Advocate”) is violating numerous provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), while improperly claiming that the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan (the “Advocate Plan”) is exempt from ERISA’s protections because it is a “church plan.” This lawsuit seeks to compel the Advocate Plan to comply with ERISA, and also seeks a declaration that the Plan does not qualify for church plan exemption.
Summary of the Claims
The Complaint alleges that the Plan is not a “church plan” because ERISA only exempts pension plans established and maintained by a “church or a convention or association of churches,” and Advocate, a healthcare corporation, does not qualify. The Complaint further alleges that Advocate and plan fiduciaries (collectively “Defendants”) are violating ERISA by:
underfunding the Plan;
failing to establish a trust to hold the assets of the Plan  that is insured through the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation;
requiring participants to complete five years of vesting service to become fully vested in the plan;
failing to furnish members of the proposed Class with Pension Benefit Statements, Summary Annual Reports, Notifications of Failure to Meet Minimum Funding, or Funding Notices; and
failing to file an annual report with respect to the Advocate Plan with the Secretary of Labor.
In addition, the lawsuit alleges that the church plan exemption, as claimed by Advocate, is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution because it is not necessary to further the stated purposes of the exemption, harms Advocate workers, puts Advocate competitors at an economic disadvantage, relieves Advocate of no genuine religious burden, and creates more government entanglement with alleged religious beliefs than compliance with ERISA creates.
Class Action
This lawsuit is brought on behalf of all participants or beneficiaries of the Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan.
Excluded from the Class are any high-level executives at Advocate or any employees who have responsibility or involvement in the administration of the Plan, or who are subsequently determined to be fiduciaries of the Advocate Plan, including the Individual Defendants.
Status of the Litigation
Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on March 17, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On June 2, 2014, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, which the Court denied on December 31, 2014. The Court held that only a church or convention or association of churches may establish an ERISA-exempt church plan, and that Advocate’s Plan is not entitled to ERISA’s church plan exemption because it was not established by a church.
Following the District Court’s ruling, Defendants filed a Motion for Interlocutory Appeal and for Stay of Proceedings, asking the District Court to certify their December 31, 2014 Order for appeal to the Seventh Circuit. The Court granted the Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on January 21, 2015, and certified the following question: “In order for an employee benefit plan to qualify as a ‘church plan’ under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2) and § 1033, must the plan be established by a church (or by a convention or association of churches)?” The Seventh Circuit granted Defendants petition for leave to appeal on February 18, 2015. 
On March 17, 2016, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s decision and ruled that the Advocate Health Care Network’s Pension Plan is ineligible for church plan exemption because it was not established by a church.  This opinion is consistent from decisions by the Third and Ninth Circuits.
On July 15, 2016, Defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to review the Seventh Circuit’s decision. The Supreme Court granted Defendant’s’ motion on December 2, 2016, and the case was consolidated with Rollins v. Dignity Health and Kaplan v. St. Peter’s Healthcare System. Oral argument was held on March 27, 2017. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by June 2017 on the question of whether a non-church organization may nevertheless claim the church plan exemption from ERISA’s protections.

EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT
statutory construction
establishment clause
RELIGION AND THE CONSTITUTION



Issues 

Does the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974’s “church plan” exemption apply to a pension plan maintained by an otherwise-qualifying church-affiliated organization, regardless of whether a church initially established the plan?



Oral argument: 

March 27, 2017



Court below : 

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit




This consolidated case provides the Supreme Court with the opportunity to resolve a conflict over the application of the “church plan” exemption of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). The parties disagree over whether the exemption applies to a pension plan maintained by a church-affiliated entity but not established by a church. Petitioners Advocate Health Care Network et al. (“Advocate”) argue that historical evidence and the statutory text establish that the exemption covers pension plans created by church agencies in addition to plans created by churches themselves. Advocate contends that a contrary interpretation would invite impermissible government interference with and discrimination between religious denominations. Maria Stapleton and fellow Respondents (“Stapleton”) contend that the language and purpose of the “church plan” exemption illustrate that it was not meant to cover a pension plan that was not created by a church. Stapleton also asserts that exempting the pension plans of church-affiliated entities from ERISA violates the Establishment Clause and puts thousands of church-agency employees at risk of losing their retirement benefits. 



Questions as Framed for the Court by the Parties 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) governs employers that offer pensions and other benefits to their employees. “Church plans” are exempt from ERISA’s coverage. 29 U.S.C. §§ 1002(33), 1003(b)(2). For over thirty years, the three federal agencies that administer and enforce ERISA—the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation—have interpreted the church plan exemption to include pension plans maintained by otherwise qualifying organizations that are associated with or controlled by a church, whether or not a church itself established the plan.The question presented is whether ERISA’s church plan exemption applies so long as a pension plan is maintained by an otherwise qualifying church-affiliated organization, or whether the exemption applies only if, in addition, a church initially established the plan.



Facts 

This case is a combination of appeals from United States Courts of Appeals for the Seventh, Ninth, and Third Circuits. The facts from each case are substantially similar. Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) in 1974 to protect employee retirement benefits. See Stapleton v. Advocate Health Care Network, 817 F.3d 517, 519. Before ERISA, there were several high-profile pension plan failures because employers were not required to provide insurance, ensure their plans were backed sufficiently, or honor their plans in the case of failure. See id. ERISA sought to address these issues by requiring employers to make certain disclosures, insure plans through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and adhere to baseline funding requirements. See id. “Church plans,” however, have always been exempt from ERISA. See id.           Petitioner Advocate Health Care Network (“Advocate”) operates twelve hospitals and over 250 other health care centers in Illinois. See Stapleton, 817 F.3d at 520. Their health care network employs over 30,000 people and generates about $4.6 billion in revenue every year. See id. Advocate was formed in 1995 from the merger of Lutheran General Health Systems and Evangelical Health Systems. See id. While not owned by a church or religious organization, Advocate is affiliated contractually with both the Metropolitan Chicago Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Illinois Conference of the United Church of Christ. See id. In its contracts with these two churches, Advocate affirms its “ministry in health care and the covenantal relationship” it shares with the churches. Id. at 521. Advocate does not maintain its pension plans in accordance with the requirements of ERISA because it believes it falls under ERISA’s church-plan exemption. See id.Respondents, Maria Stapleton, Judith Lukas, Sharon Roberts, and Antoine Fox (collectively, “Stapleton”), are current or former employees of Advocate who claim benefits under Advocate pension plans. See Stapleton, 817 F.3d at 520. Stapleton contends that Advocate should not qualify for the church-plan exemption to ERISA because Advocate’s pension plan was not developed by a church. See id. Stapleton filed this suit as a proposed class action on behalf of all the employees and beneficiaries covered by Advocate’s pension plans. See id.The Seventh Circuit found for Stapleton on March 17, 2016. See Brief for Petitioners, Advocate Health Care Network, et al. at 1. The court held that Advocate was not exempt from ERISA under the church-plan exemption and was therefore subject to significant penalties. See id. In substantially similar cases, the Third and Ninth Circuits similarly held that other pension plans maintained by church agencies did not fall within the church-plan exemption because the plans were not created by churches. See id. Petitioners from each of the three cases filed petitions for writs of certiorari in the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court subsequently granted the petitions and combined the cases into one. See id.



Analysis 

STATUTORY TEXT AND PURPOSEAdvocate contends that the statutory text, history, and purpose of ERISA, as amended in 1980, demonstrate that ERISA provides an exemption for pension plans maintained by a church-affiliated organization, even where the church itself did not establish the plan. See Brief for Petitioners, Advocate Health Care Network, et al. at 21. According to Advocate, the plain, literal language of subsection (33)(C)(i) of 29 U.S.C. § 1002 (“the definitions statute”) proves that plans established and maintained by church-affiliated organizations receive an exemption from ERISA. See id. at 21–22. Advocate asserts that any other interpretation renders the definitions statute superfluous. See id. at 24–25. Moreover, Advocate argues that prior to ERISA’s 1980 amendments, the same subparagraph explicitly mandated churches to establish pension plans; thus, Advocate argues that differences in the statute’s current language and its original language confirm that church establishment of pension plans is not required for church-affiliated organizations to receive an exemption. See id. at 27.Advocate also looks beyond the statute’s text to the statutory history and purpose of the 1980 ERISA amendment to support its claim. See Brief for Petitioners at 21. Advocate notes, first, that the 1980 amendment to ERISA was intended to address concerns of religious groups resulting from the IRS’s interpretation of ERISA’s 1974 exemption to exclude plans established by Catholic sisters. See id. at 33–35. Advocate claims that one purpose of the 1980 amendment was to prevent the IRS from deciding whether church-affiliated organizations carry out religious functions or comprise part of a church. See id. at 34–35. Advocate argues that the 1980 amendment to ERISA was also intended to place church-affiliated organizations and churches on equal ground. See id. at 38–39. Advocate explains that Congress was aware that distinguishing between church-affiliated organizations and churches resulted in discrimination between denominations, as decentralized religions were more likely than hierarchical religious groups to depend on church-affiliated organizations, and thus less likely to receive an ERISA exemption. See id. at 40–41. Further, Advocate focuses on the remarks of Senator Talmadge, a sponsor of the 1980 amendment, who pointed out that the 1974 requirement for church establishment of pension plans was at odds with the fact that pension boards frequently established pension plans. See id. Advocate maintains that because Congress was attempting to expand the church plan exemption, it does not make sense that Congress would simultaneously make it more difficult for church-affiliated organizations to obtain an exemption. See id. at 43. Advocate also notes that several of Congress’s subsequent laws assumed that church-affiliated organizations could establish pension plans on their own. See id. at 30. Advocate asserts that requiring churches to establish pension plans to receive the exemption is therefore at odds with the 1980 amendment’s history and purpose. See id. at 21.Stapleton counters that the structure, text, and history of the church-plan exemption require that pension plans must be established by a church for the exemption to apply. See Brief for Respondents, Maria Stapleton, et al. at 17. According to Stapleton, Congress prohibited church-affiliated organizations from establishing exempt pension plans by deeming the employer of the employees of a church-affiliated organization to be the church under subsection (33)(C)(iii) of the definitions statute, because pension plans can be established only by the employer under the statute. See id. at 18–20. Under Stapleton’s analysis, because church-affiliated organizations cannot establish plans under the statute, their plans clearly cannot count as exempt church plans. See id. at 20. Stapleton also disputes Advocate’s claim that Stapleton’s construction renders the words “established and” in the definitions statute superfluous. See id. at 34–35.Moreover, Stapleton disputes Advocate’s claim that the purpose of the 1980 amendment was to permit church-affiliated organizations to receive an ERISA exemption when a church did not initially establish the plan. See Brief for Respondents at 35. Stapleton argues that Congress, in fact, added subsections (33)(C)(ii)(II) and (C)(iii) to enable churches to continue providing pension plans to employees of church-affiliated organizations. See id. at 37. As evidence of this intent, Stapleton notes that under the original statute, churches would have lost the ability to provide benefits to employees of organizations affiliated with their churches in 1982. See id. at 44. Stapleton therefore contends that the point of the 1980 amendment was not to create a new loophole for church-affiliated organizations to receive an ERISA exemption or to eliminate the requirement that churches establish church plans. See id. at 20. Additionally, Stapleton argues that subsection (33)(C)(i) was not a “game-changing” provision, but rather a subsidiary provision created to address technical concerns about pension boards. See id. at 38–39. Further, Stapleton contends that permitting church-affiliated organizations to receive ERISA exemptions where a church did not initially establish the pension plan is at odds with the aim of the church-plan exemption itself, which was to prevent the “examination of books and records” of churches and protect the independence of churches in relation to the state. See id. at 57–58. According to Stapleton, the entanglement concern is a not an issue with church-affiliated organizations such as hospitals because, unlike churches, a review of church-affiliated organizations would not involve a review of activities confidential to the church. See id. Stapleton also disputes Advocate’s assertion that Congress’s subsequent laws eliminate the requirement that churches must establish church plans. See id. at 47–49.AGENCY DEFERENCEWhile Advocate asserts that the statutory language is unambiguous, it argues in the alternative that if the text is ambiguous, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and the Department of Labor (DOL) should receive deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., which provides deference to agency interpretations based on their “power to persuade.” See Brief for Petitioners at 47. According to Advocate, Skidmore deference should apply because three different agencies each came to the same interpretation of a complex statute and applied the same interpretation hundreds of times for over thirty years throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations. See id. at 48. Advocate argues that the IRS’s interpretation as set forth in its 1982 general counsel memorandum should be found persuasive because it is reasoned and detailed. See id. Moreover, Advocate notes that the IRS provided its interpretation in its memorandum shortly after the 1980 amendment, which makes it more deserving of deference. See id. at 50. Lastly, Advocate maintains that the reliance interests on the agencies’ interpretations of the 1980 amendment are so great that the interpretations should be given deference. See id. at 51. Stapleton, however, contends that the agencies’ interpretation of the statute is not entitled to Skidmore deference because the agencies have not thoroughly considered the interpretation of the portions of the statute at issue in this case. See Brief for Respondents at 51. Stapleton notes that the IRS general counsel memorandum did not consider numerous factors, including the potential harmful effects its decision could have on employees. See id. at 51–52. Stapleton also questions the legitimacy of the reliance interests cited by Advocate, noting, for instance, that the IRS memorandum specifically states that the document should not be relied upon or used as precedent. See id. at 53. In addition, Stapleton argues that if the church-affiliated organizations had to immediately comply with ERISA, they would not suffer serious consequences because essentially all businesses—including the competitors of the church-affiliated organizations—already must comply with ERISA. See id. at 54–55. Stapleton argues further that, if forced to comply with ERISA, church-affiliated organizations would be unlikely to face large financial penalties. See id.CONSTITUTIONAL AVOIDANCEAdvocate asserts that, to avoid rendering the statute constitutionally suspect, ERISA must be interpreted to permit church-affiliated organizations to establish church plans. See Brief for Petitioners at 55. Advocate contends that if only churches could establish church plans, the statute would run afoul of the First Amendment, requiring the government to become too entangled with religion by determining whether an organization constitutes a church. See id. at 56–57. In addition, Advocate argues that Stapleton’s interpretation discriminates against decentralized religions. See id. at 58. According to Advocate, such discrimination is impermissible under the Establishment Clause. See id. Moreover, Advocate notes that the Court has continued to uphold statutes providing exemptions to religious organizations from either tax or regulatory burdens, as exemptions are different from subsidies. See id. at 60–61. Advocate argues that an exemption in this case would not result in impermissible third-party harms. See id. at 61.On the other hand, Stapleton contends that the canon of constitutional avoidance requires its own reading—that ERISA’s church-plan exemption applies only when churches establish church plans—as Advocate’s reading casts serious doubts on the constitutionality of the statute. See Brief for Respondents at 56. While Stapleton concedes that the government can take steps to evade excessive entanglement with religion and can lessen government-created burdens on religion, Stapleton argues that neither is the case here. See id. at 56–58. Stapleton therefore maintains that the government’s exemption of church-affiliated organizations from ERISA, a generally applicable law, is unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause. See id. at 56. According to Stapleton, excessive government entanglement with religion would not result under its interpretation because an examination of church-affiliated organizations does not affect the confidentiality of the organization’s activities in the way that a review of a church itself does. See id. at 57–58. Stapleton also claims that both the federal and state governments often make distinctions between churches and church-affiliated organizations. See id. at 60. Moreover, Stapleton disputes Advocate’s claim that denominational discrimination would occur under its interpretation, noting that Advocate failed to name a single church or church-affiliated organization that would be discriminated against. See id. at 62. Additionally, Stapleton claims that Advocate’s reading would have significant third-party harms, including the employees of church-affiliated organizations losing ERISA protections, which makes Advocate’s reading impermissible under the Establishment Clause. See id. at 58–59.



Discussion 

RELIANCE AND COMPLIANCE COSTSThe Illinois Conference of The United Church of Christ and fellow amici (“Illinois Conference”) argue that church-agency pension plans should be exempt from ERISA, regardless of whether they were established by a church, because these organizations have relied on almost thirty-five years of rulings affirming such an exemption. See Brief of Amici Curiae Illinois Conference of the United Church of Christ, et al. (“Illinois Conference”), in Support of Petitioners at 24. According to the Illinois Conference, since ERISA’s inception, the IRS and DOL have consistently issued private letter rulings and opinions holding that the church-plan exemption applies to church-agency pension plans. See id. The Illinois Conference asserts that requiring compliance with ERISA at this stage would be unfair to the numerous organizations that have arranged their pension plans based on this guidance. See id. A group of Catholic health and social services organizations, in support of Advocate, further contend that requiring church-agencies to comply with ERISA would interfere with their charitable and religious missions. See Brief of Amici Curiae Church Defendant, in Support of Petitioners at 11. Alliance Defending Freedom and Thomas More Society (“Alliance Defending Freedom”) argue that the penalties for non-compliance and the future costs of compliance would cripple church-agencies, which would, in turn, deprive countless American communities of the critical services that these organizations provide. See Brief of Amici Curiae Alliance Defending Freedom and Thomas More Society (“Alliance Defending Freedom”), in Support of Petitioners at 11–12.In response, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and fellow amici (“Americans United”) contend that requiring compliance with ERISA would not unduly burden church-agencies, but would instead level the playing field.  See Brief of Amici Curiae Americans United for Separation of Church and State, et al. (“Americans United”), in Support of Respondents at 8. Americans United argues that church-affiliated hospitals and charities are unfairly advantaged by their current exemptions from ERISA, and that requiring compliance would simply mean they must fulfill the same obligations as secular organizations. See id. Furthermore, Pension Rights Center contends that the current expansive interpretation of the “church plan” exemption presents significant risks to the thousands of employees who work for church-affiliated groups. See Brief of Amicus Curiae Pension Rights Center, in Support of Respondents at 30. ERISA-exempt organizations do not have to insure or stand by their pension plans, which Americans United contends puts their employees at risk of losing access to the retirement benefits they have been promised. See Brief of Americans United at 11, 23. AARP and the AARP Foundation (collectively, “AARP”) point out that several church-agency pension plans have failed over the past decade and had devastating financial effects on employees. See Brief of Amici Curiae AARP and AARP Foundation, in Support of Respondents at 22–23.DISCRIMINATION AND ENTANGLEMENT WITH RELIGIONAlliance Defending Freedom argues that pension plans created by church-affiliated organizations should be exempt from ERISA because demanding compliance would lead to impermissible government discrimination between religious denominations. See Brief of Alliance Defending Freedom at 10. Further, according to Church Alliance, holding that the “church plan” exemption only applies to plans created by churches would favor hierarchical denominations, where the central church is more likely to establish a pension plan, over decentralized denominations. See Brief of Amicus Curiae Church Alliance, in Support of Petitioners at 14. The General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists (“Seventh-Day Adventists”) also argues that Advocate’s reading of the “church plan” exemption would favor denominations that place health care at the center of their religious mission. See Brief of Amicus Curiae The General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists (“Seventh-Day Adventists”), in Support of Petitioners at 24. Further, the Catholic Health Association of the United States (“Catholic Health Association”) points out that expecting the central church, such as the Vatican, to establish a pension plan misunderstands the decentralized and individualized nature of many religious denominations. See Brief of Amicus Curiae The Catholic Health Association of the United States, in Support of Petitioners at 12. The Seventh-Day Adventists also assert that requiring church-agencies to comply with ERISA would lead to excessive government entanglement with religious doctrine. See Brief of Seventh-Day Adventists at 27. The Catholic Health Association adds that limiting the “church plan” exemption would lead to the government impermissibly questioning whether entities are “religious enough” to be considered churches. See Brief of Catholic Health Association at 19. Alliance Defending Freedom argues that this interference could eventually lead religious entities to alter their operations to conform to the government’s interpretation of religiosity. See Brief of Alliance Defending Freedom at 9.Americans United asserts that Advocate’s concerns about discrimination against decentralized organizations overlook the fact that Congress specifically amended ERISA to permit the less burdensome plan administration schemes that tend to be more popular with decentralized denominations. See Brief of Americans United at 31–32. Americans United notes, for instance, that ERISA currently allows associations of churches and pension boards to maintain church plans. See id. The National Employment Lawyers Association (“NELA”) also claims that Advocate’s apprehensions about government entanglement with religion are overstated. See Brief of Amicus Curiae National Employment Lawyers Association (“NELA”), in Support of Respondents at 25–27. AARP and NELA argue that the purpose of the church-plan exemption was to prevent the government from searching through confidential church books and records, and that no such confidential records are involved when church-agencies—which are businesses, not churches—create their own pension plans. See Brief of AARP at 8; see also Brief of NELA at 25–26. Americans United and NELA also contend that the Petitioners’ concern about forcing churches to disclose confidential information to the government ignores the fact that these organizations must already disclose significant amounts of information to comply with federal programs like Medicaid. See Brief of Americans United at 8; see also Brief of NELA at 28. Furthermore, Americans United argues that the government is quite capable of deciding whether an entity qualifies as a church because there are already many requirements that apply differently to churches and other religious entities. See Brief of Americans United at 29. Americans United provides, as examples, various exemptions in the tax code that apply to churches but not to their affiliates. See id.

        Define the whys, whens, and whats


        Roadmapping comes first, build what matters second
      







          Aha! is the one product management tool you need to lead product with conviction and be happy doing it. If you are like most product managers, Aha! is what you have always wanted to replace the Word, Google, Excel, Dropbox, and PPT docs that are scattered all over your hard drive and the cloud.
        











How does your product team work?
No matter what type of product team you work with, Aha! is a tool for driving product strategy, sharing your roadmap, and detailing features and user stories. We call this the why, when, and what of roadmapping. Engineering teams are responsible for how features get developed.



The Why
Goals and initiatives


The When
Schedules and timelines


The What
Releases and features


The How
Engineering development



We know that you are doing your best to explain where the product is headed, highlight the business value, and lead your product team. We also know that engineering teams can be demanding. They want to understand your vision for the product and they require detailed features and user stories to efficiently build what customers want. The reality is that it’s not easy with the product management tools you have.
How does your engineering team work?
While many engineering teams have a bug tracking system to manage their work, others do not. Aha! works in both environments but is fundamentally designed for you – the product manager. If your engineering team uses a bug system like JIRA, we integrate directly with it allowing you to set strategy, releases, and features in Aha! and send them to JIRA to be worked. As engineers work and update JIRA, Aha! is automatically updated and you can always easily check what's happening without having to navigate another tool.
Aha! also works well for teams that do not have a bug or other engineering planning system. Aha! provides a workflow board for agile or scrum teams, status controls by feature and requirement, and cross-functional release gantt charts so you are always informed. So, regardless of how your team works, Aha! is the product tool built for you.










          Roadmap software to manage your products.
          Finally, connect strategy to execution.

Questions and Answers

Q. How does the 30 day trial work?
A. We don’t require a credit card because we want you to try Aha!
      and see that there is a better way to build brilliant roadmaps.
      After you create an account, you get instant access to all Aha!
      features for 30 days (and can upgrade at any time).
    
Q. What happens at the end of the trial?
A. We will email you before your trial expires. When you are ready
      to convert your trial you simply select the plan and the number of
      users you need. Your trial account will become your permanent
      account (everything remains intact). If you decide not to start paying at the end of your 30-day trial
      don’t worry, you can export your data. Just do it before the 30th
      day when your account will expire.
    
Q. What are the billing options?
We offer both monthly and annual billing. You can pay by credit
      card for all plans. Choose an annual plan for the additional option
      of invoice billing. Email us at support@aha.io for more details.
