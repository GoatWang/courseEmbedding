Products




Xtampza® ER
Xtampza ER is Collegium’s first product utilizing its proprietary DETERx® technology platform, and is designed to provide adequate pain control while maintaining its extended-release drug release profile after being subjected to common methods of abuse and accidental misuse. While abuse of Xtampza ER is still possible, FDA has determined that the product has abuse-deterrent properties. The Xtampza ER label supports alternate administration options, including, sprinkling the capsule contents on soft foods or into a cup, and then directly into the mouth, or through a gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tube.

ONSOLIS®
Collegium also owns the U.S. rights to ONSOLIS® (fentanyl buccal soluble film). ONSOLIS is a Transmucosal Immediate-Release Fentanyl (TIRF) film indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients (BTPc), 18 years of age and older, who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. ONSOLIS incorporates BioDelivery Sciences’ BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA®) technology for rapid and controlled delivery of fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance, via buccal (inner cheek) administration.

ONSOLIS was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 and voluntarily removed from the market in 2011 to address appearance-related issues. A reformulation of ONSOLIS was approved by the FDA in 2015. Collegium expects to launch the product after the completion of the transfer of manufacturing and submission to the FDA of a Prior Approval Supplement, which requires approval prior to launch. It is currently estimated that approval will occur in mid-2017.

Overview





Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing next generation, abuse-deterrent products for patients suffering from chronic pain.

Our Technology

	With a substantial number of patients suffering from chronic pain, Collegium is committed to developing and commercializing a portfolio of products that address the growing problems associated with non-medical use, abuse and misuse of prescription products by leveraging the Company’s proprietary DETERx® technology platform.


 
DETERx technology can be used with drugs that are commonly abused such as opioids and amphetamines, as well as drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index that would benefit from protection against misuse such as breaking, crushing, grinding, or dissolving the product. The DETERx technology platform is covered by U.S. and international patents and patent applications. 
 Xtampza ER is Collegium’s first product utilizing the DETERx technology platform. Xtampza ER is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of oxycodone approved by the FDA for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Collegium's stock jumps on belief its opioid drug will get a boost from a rival's woes
Shares of Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc.  shot up 10% in active morning trade Friday, amid expectations that the pain treatment maker will get a big boost from rival Endo International PLC's  misfortune. Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration asked Endo to "voluntarily" stop selling its opioid pain medication Opana ER, citing concerns that the drug's benefits may not outweigh the risks, as opioid abuse has reached "crisis" levels. That sent Endo's stock plunging 15%. Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said the removal of Opana ER means the near-500,000 prescriptions filled for the drug in the past year will be transferred to other products like Collegium's Xtampsa. "This provides meaningful potential upside to [Collegium's stock] and it should also help [Collegium's] messaging about Xtampza's superior abuse deterrent features because it highlights the unique nature of each product in the market," Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. Collegium's stock has shed 29.4% year to date, while Endo shares have slumped 28.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 9.2%.

Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) and Impax Laboratories (IPXL) could benefit from the Food and Drug Administration's push to have Endo International's (ENDP) opioid-based pain drug pulled from the market, analysts said Friday. Opana ER (extended release) was approved in late 2011 without abuse-deterrent properties on its label, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a note to clients. Though in crush-resistant pills, Opana has been linked to abuse

Collegium's stock jumps on belief its opioid drug will get a boost from a rival's woes
Shares of Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc.  shot up 10% in active morning trade Friday, amid expectations that the pain treatment maker will get a big boost from rival Endo International PLC's  misfortune. Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration asked Endo to "voluntarily" stop selling its opioid pain medication Opana ER, citing concerns that the drug's benefits may not outweigh the risks, as opioid abuse has reached "crisis" levels. That sent Endo's stock plunging 15%. Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said the removal of Opana ER means the near-500,000 prescriptions filled for the drug in the past year will be transferred to other products like Collegium's Xtampsa. "This provides meaningful potential upside to [Collegium's stock] and it should also help [Collegium's] messaging about Xtampza's superior abuse deterrent features because it highlights the unique nature of each product in the market," Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. Collegium's stock has shed 29.4% year to date, while Endo shares have slumped 28.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 9.2%.

How Endo's Opioid Pitfall Could Be A Boon For These Drugmakers
Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) and Impax Laboratories (IPXL) could benefit from the Food and Drug Administration's push to have Endo International's (ENDP) opioid-based pain drug pulled from the market, analysts said Friday. Opana ER (extended release) was approved in late 2011 without abuse-deterrent properties on its label, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a note to clients. Though in crush-resistant pills, Opana has been linked to abuse

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
