    PEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      AXIS Capital Holdings Limited ("AXIS Capital") (NYSE:AXS), a global
      leader in specialty insurance and reinsurance, announced today its
      inaugural Global Day of Giving Rally, a time when employees across the
      organization will come together and participate in volunteer events to
      make a positive difference in their local communities. Throughout the
      month-long rally period, AXIS Capital is providing all employees time
      off to participate in volunteer service. The campaign scales up AXIS'
      existing Day of Giving program where employees host local volunteer
      events.
    

      "The Global Day of Giving Rally was inspired by our people, many of whom
      do so much throughout the year to give back in their local communities,"
      said Albert Benchimol, President and CEO, AXIS Capital. "This campaign
      is designed to empower our people to be able to do even more while
      bringing our entire company together to help enact positive change."
    

      Added Benchimol, "AXIS is proudly a values-driven organization and we
      adhere to a philosophy that we call ‘tomorrow matters today,' a
      recognition that the actions that we take today carry a lasting impact
      on our future and that, in both life and business, we must prioritize
      the issues that matter most."
    

      Through the Global Day of Giving Rally, AXIS Capital will demonstrate
      the positive impact that can be made when employees come together and
      take a day to give back. Offices across the globe will support a broad
      range of causes from skills-based volunteering and low income senior
      care to stocking shelves at food pantries and providing support to
      disabled individuals.
    

      For those who cannot volunteer, or volunteers who wish to do even more,
      AXIS Capital also matches employee donations to qualifying organizations.

Investors in AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd (Symbol: AXS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 18th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AXS options chain for the new August 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of 40 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.43/share today. 

Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 80%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.67% return on the cash commitment, or 4.59% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history: 



Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 90 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of AXS stock at the current price level of $64.43/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.28% if the stock gets called away at the August 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red: 

Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.40% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.62% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 15%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.43) to be 15%.

Axis Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) Downgraded to “Hold” at Zacks Investment Research

					Posted by Danessa Lincoln on Jul 18th, 2017 // No Comments 




Zacks Investment Research downgraded shares of Axis Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report sent to investors on Wednesday morning. 
According to Zacks, “AXIS Capital continues to build on its Specialty Insurance, Reinsurance, and Accident and Health to pave way for long-term growth. It remains focused on deploying resources prudently, enhancing efficiencies and better serving clients and brokers across the globe. It has also been improving its portfolio mix and underwriting profitability apart from strengthening the casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment. However, stiff competition in the reinsurance industry slowing growth and lowering profitability along with escalating expenses eating into margins remain concerns. Also, shares of AXIS Capital have underperformed the Zacks categorized Property and Casualty industry year to date. Yet, the company has been witnessing estimates moving north over the last 60 days. The company is set to report second results on Jul 26. However, Zacks Rank #3 when combined with Earnings ESP of -6.98% makes prediction difficult for beat or miss.”

Axis Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) Downgraded to “Hold” at Zacks Investment Research

					Posted by Danessa Lincoln on Jul 18th, 2017 // No Comments 




Zacks Investment Research downgraded shares of Axis Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report sent to investors on Wednesday morning. 
According to Zacks, “AXIS Capital continues to build on its Specialty Insurance, Reinsurance, and Accident and Health to pave way for long-term growth. It remains focused on deploying resources prudently, enhancing efficiencies and better serving clients and brokers across the globe. It has also been improving its portfolio mix and underwriting profitability apart from strengthening the casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment. However, stiff competition in the reinsurance industry slowing growth and lowering profitability along with escalating expenses eating into margins remain concerns. Also, shares of AXIS Capital have underperformed the Zacks categorized Property and Casualty industry year to date. Yet, the company has been witnessing estimates moving north over the last 60 days. The company is set to report second results on Jul 26. However, Zacks Rank #3 when combined with Earnings ESP of -6.98% makes prediction difficult for beat or miss.”

Under the terms of the Acquisition, each Novae Shareholder will be         entitled to receive: for each Novae Share: 700 pence in cash         The consideration values the entire existing issued and to be issued         share capital of Novae at approximately £467.6 million on the basis of         a fully diluted share capital of 66,795,621 Novae Shares.         The price of 700 pence per Novae Share represents:             a premium of approximately 20 per cent. to the closing mid-market             price of 581 pence per Novae Share on 4 July 2017, being the last             Business Day before the date of this Announcement; and             a premium of approximately 29 per cent. to the volume weighted             average closing price per Novae Share for the one month period up             to and including 4 July 2017, being the last Business Day before             the date of this Announcement.         The consideration also implies a multiple of 1.5x Novae’s reported net         tangible book value of £318.8 million as at 31 December 2016 (on a         fully diluted basis).         The cash consideration payable under the Acquisition will be funded         from AXIS’s existing cash resources or, if market conditions are         favourable, from new borrowings.         It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by way of a         Court­sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies         Act, further details of which are contained in the full text of this         Announcement.         If, after the date of this Announcement, any dividend and/or other         distribution and/or other return of capital is announced, declared or         paid in respect of the Novae Shares, AXIS reserves the right to reduce         the offer consideration by an amount up to the amount of such dividend         and/or distribution and/or return of capital so announced, declared or         paid, in which case any reference in this Announcement or the Scheme         Document to the offer consideration for the Novae Shares will be         deemed to be a reference to the offer consideration as so reduced. For         further details, please refer to paragraph 15 of Part B of Appendix 1. The Board of Novae, which has been so advised by Evercore as to the         financial terms of the Acquisition, considers the terms of the         Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing their advice to         the Board of Novae, Evercore has taken into account the commercial         assessments of the Board of Novae.         Accordingly, the Novae Directors confirm that they intend unanimously         to recommend that Novae Shareholders vote to approve the Scheme at the         Court Meeting and vote in favour of the resolution to be proposed at         the General Meeting, as those of them who hold Novae Shares in their         own name or through a nominee have irrevocably undertaken to do in         respect of all of their own beneficial holdings of Novae Shares.         The terms of the Acquisition will be put to Novae Shareholders at the         Court Meeting and the General Meeting (which is expected to         immediately follow the Court Meeting). The Court Meeting and the         General Meeting are required to enable Novae Shareholders to consider,         and if thought fit, vote in favour of the resolution to approve the         Scheme and its implementation. In order to become Effective, the         Scheme must be approved by a majority in number of Scheme         Shareholders, present and voting, whether in person or by proxy,         representing 75 per cent. or more in nominal value of the Scheme         Shares held by those Scheme Shareholders.         The Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including the         receipt of required regulatory, merger control and other necessary         approvals, which are set out in Appendix 1 to this Announcement,         certain other terms as are set out in this Announcement and to the         full terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document.         AXIS is a Bermuda-based provider of specialty lines insurance and         reinsurance. AXIS is listed on the NYSE and has a market cap of c.$5.6         billion as at 3 July 2017 (being the last US business day prior to the         date of this Announcement). AXIS operates through locations in the         United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin         America, with over 1,300 employees. As at 31 March 2017, AXIS had         $6,230 million of total shareholders’ equity and $21,247 million of         total assets. Its operating subsidiaries have been assigned a rating         of “A+” (“Strong”) by Standard & Poor’s and “A+” (“Superior”) by A.M.         Best.         Novae is headquartered in London and is listed in the London Stock         Exchange. It is a diversified property and casualty (re)insurance         business operating through Syndicate 2007 at Lloyd’s. At 4 July 2017         (being the last Business Day prior to the date of this Announcement),         Novae had a market capitalisation of £374 million. As of 31 December         2016, Novae had shareholders’ equity of approximately £322 million and         total assets of approximately £2,387 million.         Commenting on the Acquisition, Albert Benchimol, President and CEO of         AXIS, said:“We are very pleased to announce this         proposed acquisition of Novae which will create a c.$2 billion player         in the London specialty market, anchored as a top 10 insurer in the         Lloyd’s market. The acquisition is fully aligned with AXIS’s         international specialty insurance growth strategy and will combine two         highly complementary businesses, substantially enhancing our depth and         breadth of product, underwriting expertise, and leadership         capabilities to better serve our clients and brokers.We         are excited about the opportunity to leverage the focused and         profitable specialty insurance business Novae has created as part of a         substantially larger group, with a larger capital base and a global         platform. We expect the combined operations to benefit         substantially from investments already made by AXIS to drive         efficiencies across its international specialty insurance business and         firmly believe this combination will create significant value for         AXIS’s shareholders with limited execution risk. This         transaction is expected to deliver meaningful earnings and ROE         accretion within the first year after close.We very         much look forward to welcoming Novae’s employees to AXIS. Novae’s         business is underpinned by the high calibre of its team, including its         market leading underwriting talent, who we expect to thrive at AXIS,         benefitting from access to a global platform and expanded resources. Our organizations share likeminded corporate cultures and we are         deeply committed to ensuring a smooth integration process and creating         a positive, collaborative environment that will breed success.”         Commenting on the Acquisition, John Hastings-Bass, Chairman of Novae,         said:“The Board of Novae is pleased to unanimously         recommend the AXIS offer, which represents an attractive outcome for         Novae and provides certainty to Novae Shareholders at an attractive         premium to the share price and net tangible assets per share. Over         recent years, Novae has made significant progress on a standalone         basis in developing its underwriting franchise and growing premiums in         its targeted lines of business. However, it remains a relatively small         player in a global industry. AXIS is a substantial and successful         business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business,         its customers and employees.”         Commenting on the Acquisition, Matthew Fosh, Chief Executive Officer         of Novae, said:“The combination of Novae and AXIS         brings together two complementary businesses. We have long held         AXIS in high regard, a company with whom we share a strong cultural         compatibility. The transaction will provide the Novae business         with the increased scale and financial resources needed to succeed in         the current market. We look forward to working closely with the         AXIS team on this next part of our journey.” Credit Suisse International and Fenchurch Advisory Partners LLP are         acting as financial advisers to AXIS. Evercore is acting as financial         adviser to Novae.         It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing further         information about the Acquisition and notices of the Court Meeting and         General Meeting, together with Forms of Proxy, will be posted to Novae         Shareholders and (for information only) to participants of the Novae         Share Schemes within 28 days of the date of this Announcement. Subject         to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, including         the Conditions, and certain further terms set out in Appendix 1 to         this Announcement and to be set out in the Scheme Document, it is         expected that the Scheme will become Effective in Q4 2017. An expected         timetable of principal events will be included in the Scheme Document.

Overseas Jurisdictions       The release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in or into       jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore       any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than       the UK should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal       or regulatory requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who       are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Novae Shares with       respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person       as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected       by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any       failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a       violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the       fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons       involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for       the violation of such restrictions by any person. This Announcement has       been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the Code       and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would       have been disclosed if this Announcement had been prepared in accordance       with the laws of jurisdictions outside of England.       Copies of this Announcement and formal documentation relating to the       Acquisition will not be, and must not be, mailed or otherwise forwarded,       distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any       jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction       and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and       trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in       or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid       any related purported vote in respect of the Acquisition. If the       Acquisition is implemented by way of Takeover Offer (unless otherwise       permitted by applicable law or regulation), the Takeover Offer may not       be made, directly or indirectly, in or into or from within any       Restricted Jurisdiction.       The Acquisition relates to the shares of an English company that is a       “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 3b­4 under the US Securities       Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is proposed to be effected by       means of a scheme of arrangement under English law. Neither the US proxy       solicitation rules nor (unless implemented by means of an offer) the       tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as       amended, will apply to the Acquisition. Accordingly, the Scheme will be       subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable to the       United Kingdom and under the Code to schemes of arrangement, which       differ from the disclosure requirements of the US proxy solicitation       rules and tender offer rules. Neither the SEC, nor any securities       commission of any state of the United States, has approved the       Acquisition, passed upon the fairness of the Acquisition or passed upon       the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the       contrary is a criminal offence in the United States. Financial       information relating to Novae included in this Announcement and the       Scheme Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with       accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom that may not be       comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose       financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles in the United States.       The receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by a US beneficial owner       of Novae Shares as consideration for the transfer of its Scheme Shares       pursuant to the Scheme will be a taxable transaction for United States       federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under       other applicable tax laws, including any applicable United States state       and local, as well as non­US, tax laws. Each Novae Shareholder is urged       to consult his independent professional adviser immediately regarding       the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to him.       If the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer and AXIS       determines to extend such offer into the United States, the offer will       be made in compliance with applicable UK and US securities laws and       regulations, including the US tender offer rules.       In accordance with normal UK practice, AXIS or its nominees, or its       brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases       of, or arrangements to purchase, Novae Shares outside of the US, other       than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the       Acquisition and/or Scheme becomes Effective, lapses or is otherwise       withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open market at       prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any       information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the       UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be       available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.       Further details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained       in the Scheme Document. Forward-looking statements       This Announcement (including information incorporated by reference in       this Announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and       other information published by AXIS and Novae contain statements which       are, or may be deemed to be, “forward looking statements”. Such forward       looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on       historical facts, but rather on current expectations and on numerous       assumptions regarding the business strategies and the environment in       which the AXIS Group or the Enlarged Group will operate in the future       and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual       results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those       statements. The forward looking statements contained in this       Announcement relate to the AXIS Group or the Enlarged Group’s future       prospects, developments and business strategies, the expected timing and       scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical       facts. In some cases, these forward looking statements can be identified       by the use of forward looking terminology, including the terms “can be”,       “target”, “expect”, “estimate”, “aims”, “opportunity”, “create”,       “represents”, “extends”, “provides”, “enables”, “achieve”, “intends”,       “will”, “would”, “could”, “should”, “proposed”, “enhancing”, “synergies”       or “believe” or their negatives or other variations or comparable       terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk       and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on       circumstances that will occur in the future. If any one or more of these       risks or uncertainties materialises or if any one or more of the       assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from       those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward looking statements       should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither AXIS       nor Novae, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers       or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that       the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking       statements in this Announcement will actually occur. Given these risks       and uncertainties, potential investors should not place any reliance on       forward looking statements.       The forward looking statements speak only at the date of this       Announcement. AXIS and Novae expressly disclaim any obligation to update       such statements other than as required by law or by the rules of any       competent regulatory authority, whether as a result of new information,       future events or otherwise. No profit forecasts       No statement in this Announcement is intended as a profit forecast or       profit estimate and no statement in this Announcement should be       interpreted to mean that earnings per Novae Share or AXIS Share for the       current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the       respective historical published earning per Novae Share or AXIS Share or       to mean that the Enlarged Group’s earnings in the first 12 months       following the Acquisition, or in any subsequent period, would       necessarily match or be greater than those of AXIS or Novae for the       relevant preceding financial period or any other period. Disclosure requirements of the Takeover Code       Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1 per       cent. or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company       or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an       offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or       is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position       Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later,       following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is       first identified.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION (IN WHOLE OR IN PART,       DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY) IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO       WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF SUCH       JURISDICTION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 5 July 2017 RECOMMENDED CASH OFFER FOR NOVAE GROUP PLC BY AXIS CAPITAL HOLDINGS LIMITED 1. INTRODUCTION       The boards of AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (“AXIS”) and Novae       Group plc (“Novae”) are pleased to announce that they have       reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all cash acquisition of       the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Novae by AXIS (or,       at AXIS’s election, a wholly­owned subsidiary of AXIS). It is intended       that the Acquisition will be implemented by way of a Court­sanctioned       scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act. 2. SUMMARY OF THE ACQUISITION       Under the terms of the Acquisition, which will be subject to the       Conditions and further terms set out in Appendix 1 of this Announcement       (and the further terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme       Document), Scheme Shareholders will be entitled to receive: for each Novae Share: 700 pence in cash       The consideration values the entire existing issued and to be issued       share capital of Novae at approximately £467.6 million on the basis of a       fully diluted share capital of 66,795,621 Novae Shares, calculated on       the basis set out in paragraph 4 of Appendix 2.       The price of 700 pence per Novae Share represents:         a premium of approximately 20 per cent. to the closing mid-market         price of 581 pence per Novae Share on 4 July 2017, being the last         Business Day before the date of this Announcement; and         a premium of approximately 29 per cent. to the volume weighted average         closing price per Novae Share for the one month period up to and         including 4 July 2017, being the last Business Day before the date of         this Announcement.       The consideration also implies a multiple of 1.5x Novae’s reported net       tangible book value of £318.8 million as at 31 December 2016 (on a fully       diluted basis).       If, after the date of this Announcement, any dividend and/or other       distribution and/or other return of capital is announced, declared or       paid in respect of the Novae Shares, AXIS reserves the right to reduce       the offer consideration by an amount up to the amount of such dividend       and/or distribution and/or return of capital so announced, declared or       paid, in which case any reference in this Announcement or the Scheme       Document to the offer consideration for the Novae Shares will be deemed       to be a reference to the offer consideration as so reduced. For further       details, please refer to paragraph 15 of Part B of Appendix 1. For the       avoidance of doubt, any payments made in cash or by way of the delivery       of shares on the vesting of awards calculated by reference to dividends       accrued in respect of those underlying vested shares are not to be       construed as a dividend, distribution or return of capital for these       purposes. 3. BACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE ACQUISITION       The Acquisition is a compelling opportunity to combine a leading       specialty Lloyd’s franchise with a world-class international specialty       (re)insurer, strengthening a broad, balanced and efficient global       underwriting platform. The international specialty insurance businesses       of AXIS and Novae are highly complementary and the combination of       expertise from both businesses can be leveraged through AXIS’s scale and       global platform. The Acquisition represents a new milestone in AXIS’s       journey as a leading specialty (re)insurance franchise and strongly       aligns with its insurance growth strategy. The Acquisition:         provides further scale and relevance in international specialty         insurance, with the combined business representing a top 10 player at         Lloyd’s, with c.$2 billion of gross premium written in the London         specialty market;         represents the combination of two highly complementary international         insurance businesses, providing AXIS with “lead” underwriting         capability in a number of new classes of business, as well as         broadened and deeper underwriting expertise in other specialty         insurance classes; and         significantly diversifies and enhances AXIS’s distribution platform,         providing increased relevance with Lloyd’s brokers and access to         market-leading programs / binding authority business (over 50 per         cent. of Novae business is produced through specialist coverholder         distribution which provides access to attractive SME and specialty         personal lines business and makes it a leading underwriter of binder         business at Lloyd’s).       The Acquisition is also expected to result in enhanced top line growth       through access to AXIS’s broader global platform (including Singapore,       Miami and Brussels), company paper and ability to increase writings and       retentions of attractive business with AXIS’s significantly larger       capital base. The businesses are naturally suited for a combination and       are also expected to accelerate AXIS Reinsurance plans at Lloyd’s,       increase options for third party capital utilisation and increase       reinsurance purchasing power.       The Acquisition is expected to be a financially compelling transaction       for AXIS shareholders with access to expense synergies as well as top       line growth. AXIS has identified up to $50m of run-rate pre-tax cost       synergies that are expected to be fully achieved within two years of       completion of the Acquisition. The pre-tax cost of achieving these cost       synergies is estimated at $40m. The transaction is expected to be:         operating EPS accretive in the first year with high single digit         accretion expected by year 2;         immediately accretive to operating return on equity;         neutral to book value per share at close with accelerated growth         post-close; and         minimal impact to tangible book value per share at close with         accelerated growth post-close. 4. RECOMMENDATION The Board of Novae, which has been so advised by Evercore as to the       financial terms of the Acquisition, considers the terms of the       Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing their advice to the       Board of Novae, Evercore has taken into account the commercial       assessments of the Board of Novae.       Accordingly, the Novae Directors confirm that they intend unanimously to       recommend that Novae Shareholders vote to approve the Scheme at the       Court Meeting and vote in favour of the resolution to be proposed at the       General Meeting as the Novae Directors who hold Novae Shares in their       own name or through a nominee have irrevocably undertaken to do in       respect of all of their own beneficial holdings of Novae Shares. 5. BACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION       Novae is a diversified property and casualty (re)insurance business that       has been operating in the Lloyd’s market for over 30 years. It has made       strong progress in terms of the scale of its franchise (with total gross       written premium of £901 million for 2016), driving value for       shareholders by focussing on underwriting excellence.       However, Novae remains a relatively small player within the global       insurance industry, which itself has seen considerable consolidation       over recent years. Furthermore, in response to challenging market       conditions, the business has been proactively reducing its exposure to       less profitable classes of business (as highlighted by Novae’s trading       update announced on 10 May 2017), exiting certain classes where premium       rates are no longer generating adequate financial returns. Other       factors, outside of the control of the business, notably, the Lord       Chancellor’s decision to materially cut the personal injury discount       rate (“Ogden”) earlier this year (adversely impacting Novae’s       reserves), have compounded the headwinds from a difficult trading       environment.       The increased prevalence of large and catastrophic losses during 2016,       together with the one-off impact of the Ogden provision and other       accounting charges taken in the year, have resulted in a decline in       Novae’s net assets and capital. As a consequence, Novae’s scope to take       full advantage of the profitable growth opportunities within its core       classes on a stand-alone basis will be constrained, with the resulting       profit recovery likely more muted than if Novae had greater capital       resources at its disposal. The Board of Novae is aware that having increased scale, broader       diversification and improved broker access will be key determinants of       success in current market conditions. The Board of Novae has also       evaluated the proposed offer by AXIS against the backdrop of challenging       markets and the specific factors that have impacted Novae itself. Whilst       the Board of Novae has confidence in Novae’s management’s ability to       meet these challenges, it considers that the Acquisition provides Novae       shareholders with a certain cash value which represents an attractive       premium to Novae’s share price and net tangible assets per share       (in-line with levels achieved in other transactions in the Property and       Casualty sector in recent years), and fairly reflects Novae’s longer       term prospects and potential. In assessing the terms of the Acquisition,       the Board of Novae has also specifically considered the following:         the strategic benefits from scale that Novae will benefit from by         combining with AXIS, in an industry that has undergone considerable         consolidation in recent years;         the enhanced opportunities that Novae will have as part of a larger         group, particularly in terms of the distribution of its specialty         products, through access to the broader AXIS platform;         increased relevance to brokers and intermediaries on a combined basis;         and         the cultural compatibility of the two organisations with significant         and improved opportunities for Novae staff as part of the Enlarged         Group. 6. MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESS OF NOVAE       AXIS attaches great importance to the skills and experience of the       existing management and employees of the Novae Group.       AXIS confirms that, following completion of the Acquisition, the       existing contractual and statutory employment rights of, and pension       obligations owed to, existing management and employees of the Novae       Group will be fully safeguarded. It is AXIS’s intention to consider       employees of both AXIS and Novae to fill roles within the Enlarged       Group, based on a meritocratic approach as the combined business       transitions to a single managing agency and syndicate.       It is anticipated that Novae will be merged into the international       division of AXIS’s insurance segment and, as part of the process, that       Novae will adopt the AXIS Insurance International brand. It is envisaged       that the integration process will take approximately one year to       complete and will eventually lead to the relocation of Novae personnel       to shared office space in London alongside the current AXIS team.       It is expected that, following completion of the Acquisition, Matthew       Fosh (Chief Executive Officer of Novae) will be appointed as AXIS’s       Executive Chair, Europe. Among his responsibilities in his new role,       Matthew Fosh will help guide the integration of the two businesses and       will report to Albert Benchimol (President and Chief Executive Officer       of AXIS). Additionally, it is expected that Robert Forster (Chief       Underwriting Officer of Novae) will be appointed to a senior       underwriting management role on the leadership team of AXIS Insurance’s       International Division. 7. DIRECTORS’ IRREVOCABLE UNDERTAKINGS       AXIS has received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favour of the       Scheme at the Court Meeting and the resolution to be proposed at the       General Meeting from those of the Novae Directors who hold Novae Shares       in their own name or through a nominee in respect of all their own       beneficial holdings of Novae Shares. The undertakings from the Novae       Directors will cease to be binding only if (among other things) the       Scheme lapses or is withdrawn and remain binding in the event that a       higher competing offer for Novae is made.       Copies of the irrevocable undertakings will be on display on AXIS’s       website at www.axiscapital.com       and Novae’s website at www.novae.com       from 12 noon on 6 July 2017 until the end of the Acquisition.       Further details of these irrevocable undertakings are set out in       Appendix 3 of this Announcement. 8. INFORMATION RELATING TO AXIS       Established in 2001, AXIS is a Bermuda-based global insurer and       reinsurer, providing clients and distribution partners with a broad       range of specialised risk transfer products and services.       AXIS listed on the NYSE in 2003 and has a market cap of c.$5.6 billion       as at 3 July 2017 (being the last US business day prior to the date of       this Announcement). Headquartered in Bermuda, AXIS operates through       locations in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East,       Canada and Latin America, with over 1,300 employees. AXIS has total       managed capital of $7.9 billion as at 31 December 2016 and its operating       subsidiaries have been assigned a rating of “A+” (“Strong”) by Standard       & Poor’s and “A+” (“Superior”) by A.M. Best.       AXIS is segmented into two global underwriting platforms: AXIS Insurance, provides a customised coverage for property,         liability, marine, energy, aviation, terrorism, professional lines,         political risk, accident and health, credit risk and other specialty         risks on a worldwide basis; and         AXIS Reinsurance, provides non-life reinsurance to insurance companies         on a worldwide basis.       For the year ending 31 December 2016, AXIS reported gross written       premiums of $4,970 million and net income for the year of $513 million.       As at 31 March 2017, AXIS had $6,230 million of total shareholders’       equity and $21,247 million of total assets. 9. FINANCING       The consideration will be funded from AXIS’s existing cash resources or,       if market conditions are favourable, from new borrowings.       Each of Credit Suisse International and Fenchurch Advisory Partners LLC,       joint financial advisers to AXIS, have confirmed that they are each       satisfied that sufficient resources are available to AXIS to satisfy in       full the payment of the cash consideration payable in respect of the       Scheme. Based on a fully diluted share capital of 66,795,621 Novae       Shares at the Effective Date, full implementation of the Scheme would       result in cash consideration amounting to approximately £467.6 million       being payable by AXIS to Novae Shareholders and participants in the       Novae Share Schemes. 10. INFORMATION RELATING TO NOVAE       Novae is a diversified property and casualty (re)insurer headquartered       in London and operates through Syndicate 2007 at Lloyd’s. It was       established in 1986 and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange       since 1998. Novae writes both insurance and reinsurance for property,       casualty and marine, aviation and political risk. The Novae Group       employs approximately 350 people between its offices in London and       Bermuda.       Novae is segmented into two main divisions:         Property, including US, UK and European Property Facilities, Medical         Malpractice and Property Reinsurance; and         Marine, Aviation, Political Risk and Specialty, including Cyber,         Marine & Energy, Political & Credit, US Excess Casualty and Aviation         Reinsurance.       For the year ending 31 December 2016, Novae reported gross written       premiums of approximately £901 million and profit before tax for the       year of approximately £24 million. As at 31 December 2016, Novae had       approximately £2,387 million of total assets and approximately £322       million of shareholders’ equity.       The Novae Group’s business has a proactive strategy focused on expert       underwriting, consistent performance and dynamic capital management. As       part of this, Novae has re-focused on a select number of core lines of       business where it has underwriting expertise and can produce sustainable       profits (core lines comprise Novae’s “Invest” and “Maintain” classes       which delivered an average combined ratio of 80 per cent. between 2013       and 2016). Since 2013, this has resulted in Novae exiting 15 classes of       business in lines where it does not hold leading offerings or where       rates are under persistent market pressure, and growing its attractive       core classes by approximately £410 million. 11. NOVAE SHARE SCHEMES       Participants in any of the Novae Share Schemes will be contacted       regarding the effect of the Acquisition on their rights under those       plans and provided with further details concerning the proposals which       will be made to them in due course.       Appropriate proposals will be made to the holders of vested and unvested       awards under the Novae Share Schemes. 12. OFFER-RELATED ARRANGEMENTS       AXIS and Novae have entered into a confidentiality agreement dated 6       June 2017 pursuant to which AXIS has undertaken, amongst other things,       to: (a) keep confidential information relating to the Acquisition and       Novae and not to disclose such information to third parties (other than       certain permitted parties) unless required by law or regulation; and (b)       use the confidential information only in connection with the acquisition       of the whole of the issued and to be issued share capital of Novae.       Novae and AXIS have also entered into the Share Scheme Letter containing       certain provisions that will apply in respect of the Novae Share       Schemes, directors’ and officers’ insurance and certain other       arrangements relating to employees. 13. STRUCTURE OF THE ACQUISITION       It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by means of a       Court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies       Act. The Scheme is an arrangement between Novae and the Scheme       Shareholders and is subject to the approval of the Court. The procedure       involves, among other things, an application by Novae to the Court to       sanction the Scheme, in consideration for which Scheme Shareholders will       receive cash on the basis described in paragraph 2 above. The purpose of       the Scheme is to provide for AXIS to become the owner of the entire       issued and to be issued share capital of Novae.       The Acquisition is subject to a number of Conditions and certain further       terms set out in Appendix 1 to this Announcement and to the full terms       and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document, and will only       become Effective if, among other things, the following events occur on       or before the Longstop Date:         a resolution to approve the Scheme is passed by a majority in number         of the Scheme Shareholders present and voting (and entitled to vote)         at the Court Meeting, either in person or by proxy, representing 75         per cent. or more in value of the Scheme Shares held by those Scheme         Shareholders;         the Special Resolution necessary to implement the Scheme is passed at         the General Meeting (which will require the approval of Novae         Shareholders representing at least 75 per cent. of the votes cast at         the General Meeting), which is expected to be held immediately after         the Court Meeting;         following the Novae Meetings, the Scheme is sanctioned by the Court         (without modification or with modification on terms agreed by AXIS and         Novae); and         following such sanction, an office copy of the Scheme Court Order is         delivered to the Registrar of Companies of England and Wales.       Upon the Scheme becoming Effective: (i) it will be binding on all Novae       Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at       the Court Meeting and the General Meeting (and if they attended and       voted, whether or not they voted in favour); and (ii) share certificates       in respect of Novae Shares will cease to be of value and should be       destroyed and entitlements to Novae Shares held within the CREST system       will be cancelled. The consideration payable under the Scheme will be       despatched to Scheme Shareholders by AXIS no later than 14 days after       the Effective Date.       Any Novae Shares issued before the Scheme Record Time will be subject to       the terms of the Scheme. The Special Resolution to be proposed at the       General Meeting will, amongst other matters, provide that the Articles       be amended to incorporate provisions requiring any Novae shares issued       after the Scheme Record Time (other than to AXIS and/or its nominees) to       be automatically transferred to AXIS on the same terms as the       Acquisition (other than terms as to timings and formalities). The       provisions of the Articles (as amended) will avoid any person (other       than AXIS and its nominees) holding shares in the capital of Novae after       the Effective Date.       The Scheme will lapse and the Acquisition will not proceed if:         the Court Meeting and the General Meeting are not held by the 22nd         day after the expected date of such meetings to be set out in the         Scheme Document in due course; or         the Scheme does not become Effective by the Longstop Date,       provided however that the deadlines for the timing of the Court Meeting       and the General Meeting and the deadline for the Scheme to become       Effective may be extended by agreement between AXIS and Novae, with the       approval of the Court and/or the consent of the Panel, if required.       The Scheme will lapse and will not become Effective if:       (a) insofar as the Merger constitutes, or is deemed to constitute, a       concentration with an EU dimension within the scope of the Regulation,       the European Commission either initiates proceedings under Article       6(1)(c) of the Regulation or makes a referral to the CMA under Article       4(4) or Article 9(1) of the Regulation and there is then a reference of       the Merger or matter arising from or relating to it to the chair of the       CMA for the constitution of a group under schedule 4 to the Enterprise       and Regulatory Reform Act 2013; or       (b) in so far as the Merger does not constitute, or is not deemed to       constitute, a concentration with an EU dimension within the scope of the       Regulation, the Merger or any matter arising from or relating to it       becomes subject to a reference to the chair of the CMA for the       constitution of a group under schedule 4 to the Enterprise and       Regulatory Reform Act 2013,       in either case, before the date of the Court Meeting and the General       Meeting.       The Acquisition is conditional, amongst others, on the PRA and the FCA       having approved (or being treated as having approved) the acquisition of       control over the relevant regulated entities within the Novae Group       which would result from the Acquisition, as more particularly described       in Conditions 3.1 and 3.2. The Acquisition is also conditional on       Lloyd's giving its consent to each member of the AXIS Group becoming a       controller of the relevant regulated entities within the Novae Group as       a result of the Acquisition, as more particularly described in Condition       3.3.       It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing further information       about the Acquisition and notices of the Court Meeting and General       Meeting, together with Forms of Proxy, will be posted to Novae       Shareholders and (for information only) to participants of the Novae       Share Schemes within 28 days of the date of this Announcement. Subject       to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, including the       Conditions, and certain further terms set out in Appendix 1 to this       Announcement and to be set out in the Scheme Document, it is expected       that the Scheme will become Effective in Q4 2017. An expected timetable       of principal events will be included in the Scheme Document. 14. DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS IN NOVAE       As at the close of business on 4 July 2017, being the last Business Day       before the date of this Announcement, neither AXIS nor the directors of       AXIS nor, so far as AXIS is aware, any person acting in concert with       AXIS, had any interest in, right to subscribe for, or had borrowed or       lent any Novae Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into       Novae Shares, nor did any such person have any short position (whether       conditional or absolute and whether in the money or otherwise),       including any short position under a derivative, any agreement to sell       or any delivery obligation or right to require another person to take       delivery, or any dealing arrangement of the kind referred to in Note 11       of the definition of acting in concert in the Code, in relation to Novae       Shares or in relation to any securities convertible or exchangeable into       Novae Shares.       In the interests of secrecy prior to releasing this Announcement, it has       not been practicable for AXIS to have made any enquiries of certain       parties who may be deemed by the Panel to be acting in concert with       AXIS. Enquiries of such parties will be made as soon as practicable       following the date of this Announcement and AXIS confirms that further       disclosure in accordance with Rule 8.1(a) and Note 2(a)(i) on Rule 8 of       the Code will be made as soon as possible, if required. 15. DELISTING AND RE-REGISTRATION       It is intended that dealings in Novae Shares should be suspended shortly       prior to the Effective Date at a time to be set out in the Scheme       Document. It is further intended that an application will be made to the       London Stock Exchange for the cancellation of the trading of Novae       Shares on its main market for listed securities and the UK Listing       Authority will be requested to cancel the listing of Novae Shares on the       Official List to take effect on or shortly after the Effective Date.       Share certificates in respect of the Novae Shares will cease to be valid       and should be destroyed on the first Business Day following the       Effective Date.       In addition, entitlements held within the CREST system to the Novae       Shares will be cancelled on the first Business Day following the       Effective Date. 16. OVERSEAS SHAREHOLDERS       The release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in or into       jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore       any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than       the UK should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal       or regulatory requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who       are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Novae Shares with       respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person       as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected       by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any       failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a       violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the       fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons       involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for       the violation of such restrictions by any person. This Announcement has       been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the Code       and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would       have been disclosed if this Announcement had been prepared in accordance       with the laws of jurisdictions outside of England.       This Announcement is for information purposes only and is not intended       to and does not constitute or form part of, any offer, invitation or the       solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for,       sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, or the solicitation of any       vote or approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to the Acquisition or       otherwise nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of       securities of Novae in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable       law. The Acquisition will be implemented solely by means of the Scheme       Document (or if the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover       Offer, the offer document), which will contain the full terms and       conditions of the Acquisition including details of how to vote in       respect of the Acquisition. Any vote in respect of the Scheme (or, if       applicable, the Takeover Offer) or other response in relation to the       Acquisition should be made only on the basis of the information       contained in the Scheme Document (or, if applicable, acceptance under       the offer document). Each Novae Shareholder is urged to consult his       independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax       consequences of the Acquisition applicable to him. 17. DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED ON A WEBSITE       Copies of the following documents will, no later than 12 noon on 6 July       2017, be available on AXIS’s website at www.axiscapital.com       and Novae’s website at www.novae.com       until the end of the Acquisition:         this Announcement;         the irrevocable undertakings referred to in paragraph 7 (further         details of which are set out in Appendix 3 of this Announcement); and         the confidentiality agreement and the Share Scheme Letter referred to         in paragraph 12.       The contents of Novae’s website and AXIS’s website are not incorporated       into and do not form part of this Announcement. 18. GENERAL       The Acquisition will be subject to the Conditions and certain further       terms set out in Appendix 1 and the further terms and conditions to be       set out in the Scheme Document when issued.       AXIS shall be entitled to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover       Offer rather than the Scheme with the consent of the Panel.       If the Acquisition is effected by way of a Takeover Offer and such       Takeover Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects and       sufficient acceptances are received, AXIS intends to exercise its rights       to apply the provisions of Chapter 3 of Part 28 of the Companies Act to       acquire compulsorily the remaining Novae Shares in respect of which the       Takeover Offer has not been accepted.       The Acquisition will be governed by English law and will be subject to       the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. The Acquisition       will be subject to the applicable requirements of the Code, the Panel,       the London Stock Exchange and the FCA.       The sources of certain financial information and bases of calculation       contained in this Announcement are set out in Appendix 2. Certain terms       used in this Announcement are defined in Appendix 4.

Further Information       This Announcement is for information purposes only and is not intended       to and does not constitute or form part of, any offer, invitation or the       solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for,       sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, or the solicitation of any       vote or approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to the Acquisition or       otherwise nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of       securities of Novae in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable       law. The Acquisition will be implemented solely by means of the Scheme       Document (or if the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover       Offer, the offer document), which will contain the full terms and       conditions of the Acquisition including details of how to vote in       respect of the Acquisition. Any vote in respect of the Scheme (or, if       applicable, the Takeover Offer) or other response in relation to the       Acquisition should be made only on the basis of the information       contained in the Scheme Document (or, if applicable, acceptance under       the offer document). Each Novae Shareholder is urged to consult his       independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax       consequences of the Acquisition applicable to him.

Evercore, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct       Authority in the United Kingdom, is acting as financial adviser       exclusively for Novae and no one else in connection with the matters       referred to in this Announcement and will not regard any other person as       its client in relation to the matters referred to in this Announcement       and will not be responsible to anyone other than Novae for providing the       protections afforded to clients of Evercore, nor for providing advice in       relation to the content of this Announcement or any matter referred to       herein. Neither Evercore nor any of its subsidiaries, branches or       affiliates owes or accepts any duty, liability or responsibility       whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, whether in contract, in tort,       under statute or otherwise) to any person who is not a client of       Evercore in connection with this announcement, any statement contained       herein or otherwise.

Overseas Jurisdictions       The release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in or into       jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore       any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than       the UK should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal       or regulatory requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who       are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Novae Shares with       respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person       as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected       by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any       failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a       violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the       fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons       involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for       the violation of such restrictions by any person. This Announcement has       been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the Code       and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would       have been disclosed if this Announcement had been prepared in accordance       with the laws of jurisdictions outside of England.       Copies of this Announcement and formal documentation relating to the       Acquisition will not be, and must not be, mailed or otherwise forwarded,       distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any       jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction       and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and       trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in       or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid       any related purported vote in respect of the Acquisition. If the       Acquisition is implemented by way of Takeover Offer (unless otherwise       permitted by applicable law or regulation), the Takeover Offer may not       be made, directly or indirectly, in or into or from within any       Restricted Jurisdiction.       The Acquisition relates to the shares of an English company that is a       “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 3b­4 under the US Securities       Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is proposed to be effected by       means of a scheme of arrangement under English law. Neither the US proxy       solicitation rules nor (unless implemented by means of an offer) the       tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as       amended, will apply to the Acquisition. Accordingly, the Scheme will be       subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable to the       United Kingdom and under the Code to schemes of arrangement, which       differ from the disclosure requirements of the US proxy solicitation       rules and tender offer rules. Neither the SEC, nor any securities       commission of any state of the United States, has approved the       Acquisition, passed upon the fairness of the Acquisition or passed upon       the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the       contrary is a criminal offence in the United States. Financial       information relating to Novae included in this Announcement and the       Scheme Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with       accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom that may not be       comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose       financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles in the United States.       The receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by a US beneficial owner       of Novae Shares as consideration for the transfer of its Scheme Shares       pursuant to the Scheme will be a taxable transaction for United States       federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under       other applicable tax laws, including any applicable United States state       and local, as well as non­US, tax laws. Each Novae Shareholder is urged       to consult his independent professional adviser immediately regarding       the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to him.       If the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer and AXIS       determines to extend such offer into the United States, the offer will       be made in compliance with applicable UK and US securities laws and       regulations, including the US tender offer rules.       In accordance with normal UK practice, AXIS or its nominees, or its       brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases       of, or arrangements to purchase, Novae Shares outside of the US, other       than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the       Acquisition and/or Scheme becomes Effective, lapses or is otherwise       withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open market at       prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any       information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the       UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be       available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com       .       Further details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained       in the Scheme Document. Forward-looking statements       This Announcement (including information incorporated by reference in       this Announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and       other information published by AXIS and Novae contain statements which       are, or may be deemed to be, “forward looking statements”. Such forward       looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on       historical facts, but rather on current expectations and on numerous       assumptions regarding the business strategies and the environment in       which the AXIS Group or the Enlarged Group will operate in the future       and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual       results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those       statements. The forward looking statements contained in this       Announcement relate to the AXIS Group or the Enlarged Group’s future       prospects, developments and business strategies, the expected timing and       scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical       facts. In some cases, these forward looking statements can be identified       by the use of forward looking terminology, including the terms “can be”,       “target”, “expect”, “estimate”, “aims”, “opportunity”, “create”,       “represents”, “extends”, “provides”, “enables”, “achieve”, “intends”,       “will”, “would”, “could”, “should”, “proposed”, “enhancing”, “synergies”       or “believe” or their negatives or other variations or comparable       terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk       and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on       circumstances that will occur in the future. If any one or more of these       risks or uncertainties materialises or if any one or more of the       assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from       those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward looking statements       should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither AXIS       nor Novae, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers       or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that       the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking       statements in this Announcement will actually occur. Given these risks       and uncertainties, potential investors should not place any reliance on       forward looking statements.       The forward looking statements speak only at the date of this       Announcement. AXIS and Novae expressly disclaim any obligation to update       such statements other than as required by law or by the rules of any       competent regulatory authority, whether as a result of new information,       future events or otherwise. No profit forecasts       No statement in this Announcement is intended as a profit forecast or       profit estimate and no statement in this Announcement should be       interpreted to mean that earnings per Novae Share or AXIS Share for the       current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the       respective historical published earning per Novae Share or AXIS Share or       to mean that the Enlarged Group’s earnings in the first 12 months       following the Acquisition, or in any subsequent period, would       necessarily match or be greater than those of AXIS or Novae for the       relevant preceding financial period or any other period. Disclosure requirements of the Takeover Code       Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1 per       cent. or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company       or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an       offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or       is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position       Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later,       following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is       first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of       the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe       for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii)       any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a       person to whom Rule 8.3(a) of the Code applies must be made by no later       than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th Business Day following the       commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than       3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th Business Day following the       announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first       identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the       offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the       deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a       Dealing Disclosure.       Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested       in 1 per cent. or more of any class of relevant securities of the       offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a       Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the       offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing       Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the       person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for,       any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any       securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details       have previously been disclosed under Rule 8 of the Code. A Dealing       Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) of the Code applies must be       made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the Business Day       following the date of the relevant dealing.       If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or       understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an       interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities       exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the       purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Code.       Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company       and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the       offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert       with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4 of the Code).

PART B: FURTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS Waiver and invocation of the Conditions       5. The Scheme will not become Effective unless the Conditions have been       fulfilled or (if capable of waiver) waived or, where appropriate, have       been determined by AXIS to be or remain satisfied by no later than the       Longstop Date.       6. Subject to the requirements of the Panel, AXIS reserves the right to       waive, in whole or in part, all or any of the above Conditions, except       Condition 2.       7. Conditions 3.1 to 3.14 (inclusive) must be fulfilled, or waived, by       no later than 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the date of       the Scheme Court Hearing, failing which the Scheme will lapse. AXIS       shall not be obliged: (i) to waive or treat as satisfied any Condition       that AXIS is entitled, with the permission of the Panel where required       by the Code, to invoke; or (ii) where AXIS has given notice to Novae       that it considers it is or may be entitled to invoke a Condition, to       waive or treat as satisfied any Condition before the date on which the       Panel rules (or if any such ruling is capable to appeal, AXIS confirms       that it does not intend to appeal) that any such Condition may not be       invoked.       8. AXIS undertakes that it will, immediately before the Scheme Court       Hearing, provide notice in writing to Novae that either (i) the       Conditions (except Condition 2) have each been satisfied or that AXIS       has waived or treated as satisfied such Conditions or (ii) to the extent       permitted by the Panel, it intends to invoke or treat as incapable of       satisfaction each or any Condition.       9. Each of the Conditions shall be regarded as a separate Condition and       shall not be limited by reference to any other Condition. Implementation by way of Takeover Offer       10. Subject to obtaining the consent of the Panel, AXIS reserves the       right to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer       as an alternative to the Scheme. In such event, such Takeover Offer will       be implemented on substantially the same terms and conditions, so far as       applicable, as those which would apply to the Scheme subject to       appropriate amendments to reflect the change in method of effecting the       Takeover Offer, including (without limitation) the inclusion of an       acceptance condition set at 75 per cent. (or such lower percentage as       AXIS may, subject to the rules of the Code and with the consent of the       Panel, decide) of the Novae Shares to which the Takeover Offer relates       or, where any of the circumstances set out in Note 2 of Section 8 of       Appendix 7 of the Code applies, 90 per cent. of the Novae Shares to       which the Takeover Offer relates (or such other percentage, being more       than 50 per cent. of the Novae Shares to which the Takeover Offer       relates, as AXIS may, subject to the rules of the Code and with the       consent of the Panel, decide). Certain further terms of the Acquisition       11. Under Rule 13.5(a) of the Code, AXIS may not invoke a Condition to       the Acquisition so as to cause the Acquisition not to proceed, to lapse       or to be withdrawn unless the circumstances which give rise to the right       to invoke the Condition are of material significance to AXIS in the       context of the Acquisition. Condition 2 and, if applicable, any       acceptance condition if the Acquisition is implemented by means of a       Takeover Offer, are not subject to this provision of the Code.       12. If AXIS is required by the Panel to make an offer for Novae Shares       under the provisions of Rule 9 of the Code, AXIS may make such       alterations to any of the above Conditions as are necessary to comply       with the provisions of that Rule.       13. The Scheme will lapse and will not become Effective if:       (a) insofar as the Merger constitutes, or is deemed to constitute, a       concentration with an EU dimension within the scope of the Regulation,       the European Commission either initiates proceedings under Article       6(1)(c) of the Regulation or makes a referral to the CMA under Article       4(4) or Article 9(1) of the Regulation and there is then a reference of       the Merger or matter arising from or relating to it to the chair of the       CMA for the constitution of a group under schedule 4 to the Enterprise       and Regulatory Reform Act 2013; or       (b) in so far as the Merger does not constitute, or is not deemed to       constitute, a concentration with an EU dimension within the scope of the       Regulation, the Merger or any matter arising from or relating to it       becomes subject to a reference to the chair of the CMA for the       constitution of a group under schedule 4 to the Enterprise and       Regulatory Reform Act 2013,       in either case, before the date of the Court Meeting and the General       Meeting.       14. Novae Shares will be acquired by AXIS fully paid and free from all       liens, equitable interests, charges, encumbrances, rights of pre­emption       and other third party rights of any nature whatsoever and together with       all rights attaching to them as at the date of this Announcement or       subsequently attaching or accruing to them, including the right to       receive and retain, in full, all dividends and other distributions (if       any) paid or payable, or any other return of capital made, on or after       the date of this Announcement.       15. If, on or after the date of this Announcement, any dividend and/or       other distribution and/or other return of capital is announced, declared       or paid in respect of the Novae Shares, AXIS reserves the right (without       prejudice to any right of AXIS to invoke Condition 3.11(f)), to reduce       the offer consideration for the Novae Shares by an amount up to the       amount of such dividend and/or distribution and/or return of capital so       announced, declared or paid, in which case any reference in this       Announcement or in the Scheme Document to the offer consideration for       the Novae Shares will be deemed to be a reference to the offer       consideration as so reduced. To the extent that any such dividend and/or       distribution and/or other return of capital is announced, declared or       paid and it is: (i) transferred pursuant to the Acquisition on a basis       which entitles AXIS to receive the dividend or distribution and to       retain it; or (ii) cancelled, the offer consideration will not be       subject to change in accordance with this paragraph. Any exercise by       AXIS of its rights referred to in this paragraph shall be the subject of       an announcement and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be regarded       as constituting any revision or variation of the Acquisition. For the       further avoidance of doubt, any payments made in cash or by way of the       delivery of shares on the vesting of awards calculated by reference to       dividends accrued in respect of those underlying vested shares are not       to be construed as a dividend, distribution or return of capital for       these purposes.       16. The Acquisition will be subject, inter alia, to the       Conditions and certain further terms which are set out in this Appendix       1 and those terms which will be set out in the Scheme Document and the       Share Scheme Letter and such further terms as may be required to comply       with the Listing Rules and the provisions of the Code.       17. The availability of the Acquisition to persons not resident in the       United Kingdom may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.       Any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than       the United Kingdom should inform themselves about and observe any       applicable requirements. Further information in relation to Overseas       Shareholders will be contained in the Scheme Document.       18. This Announcement and any rights or liabilities arising hereunder,       the Acquisition, the Scheme, and proxies will be governed by English law       and be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England       and Wales. The Scheme will be subject to the applicable requirements of       the Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange and the FCA. APPENDIX 2 SOURCES OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND BASES OF CALCULATION USED IN       THIS ANNOUNCEMENT       In this Announcement, unless otherwise stated, or the context otherwise       requires, the following bases and sources have been used:       1. Financial information relating to Novae is extracted (without       adjustment) from the audited consolidated financial statements for the       Novae Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2016.       2. The value of the Acquisition is calculated on the basis of the fully       diluted number of Novae Shares (at the price per Novae Share set out on       page 1 of this Announcement) in issue referred to in paragraph 4 below.       3. As at the close of business on 4 July 2017, being the Business Day       before the date of this Announcement, Novae had in issue 64,425,640       Novae Shares. The ISIN for Novae Shares is GB00B40SF849.       4. The fully diluted share capital of Novae (being 66,795,621 Novae       Shares) is calculated on the basis of 64,425,640 Novae Shares in issue       on 4 July 2017, being the Business Day before the date of this       Announcement (which includes the number of Novae Shares (being       1,027,994) held by Sanne Trust Company Limited, Novae’s employee benefit       trust) and in addition up to 2,369,981 further Novae Shares based on the       maximum position under scheme rules which could be issued pursuant to       such rules on or after the date of this Announcement via the vesting of       awards, or settled via alternative means, under the Novae Share Schemes       on the basis explained in this Announcement. The calculation of the       fully diluted share capital of Novae does not take into account (i) the       arrangements relating to the vesting of awards under the Novae Share       Schemes contained in the Share Scheme Letter or (ii) any amount which       could be payable on the vesting of awards under the Novae Shares Schemes       in respect of dividends that would have accrued in respect of the       underlying vested shares under those awards and which could be settled       in Novae Shares.       5. The price per Novae Share set out on page 1 of this Announcement       values the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of       Novae at approximately £467.6 million on the basis of a fully diluted       share capital of 66,795,621 Novae Shares, assuming that all rights in       respect of the vesting of awards under the Novae Share Schemes are       exercised, or settled via alternative means, on the basis explained in       paragraph 4 above.       6. The reported net tangible book value of Novae of £318.8 million       referred to on pages 1 and 10 of this Announcement is extracted from the       audited consolidated financial statements for the Novae Group for the       financial year ended 31 December 2016.       7. The total managed capital amount of $7.9 billion referred to on page       13 of this Announcement is composed of common equity of $5.1 billion,       debt of $1 billion, third party capital of $1 billion and preferred       equity of $0.8 billion. The common equity and debt figures are extracted       from the audited consolidated financial statements for the AXIS Group       for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 and the third party       capital and preferred equity figures are extracted from an insurance       conference presentation by AXIS to Bank of America Merril Lynch dated 15       February 2017.       8. The reference to the creation of a c.$2 billion player in the London       specialty market on page 2 of this announcement and c.$2 billion of       gross premium written in the London specialty market on page 11 of this       Announcement is composed of $291 million written at Lloyd’s by AXIS,       $1,222 million written at Lloyd’s by Novae and $487 million written on       AXIS company paper.       9. Unless otherwise stated, all prices and closing prices for Novae       Shares are closing middle market quotations derived from the daily       official list of the London Stock Exchange.       10. Certain of the figures included in this Announcement have been       subject to rounding to the nearest decimal point or nearest two decimal       points (as applicable).       11. Where the term “nominee” is used on pages 2, 12 and 13 of this       Announcement, it shall not include Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited,       being the trustee of the Novae Share Incentive Plans.       12. The exchange rates used for the conversion of Sterling amounts to US       Dollar amounts (and vice versa) in this Announcement (where relevant)       are: (i) a spot exchange rate of GBP 1 : USD 1.292 (source: Bloomberg on       4 July 2017), and (ii) a 2016 yearly average exchange rate of GBP 1 :       USD 1.356 (source: OFX).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
