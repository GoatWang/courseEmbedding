Our vendor's methodology for the EPS on the infoquote and Summary Quote pages follows the EPS used by the majority of the analysts following the stock, in many cases this is EBITDA EPS.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
Broadway Financial Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under Delaware
law in 1995 for the purpose of acquiring and holding all of the outstanding
capital stock of Broadway Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Broadway
Federal" or the "Bank") as part of the Bank's conversion from a federally
chartered mutual savings association to a federally chartered stock savings

Federal Bank, f.s.b. The conversion was completed, and the Bank became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in January 1996.

The Company is currently regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System ("FRB"). The Bank is currently regulated by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC"). The Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by
the FDIC. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of
San Francisco.  ... More ...
