Form 13D is SEC filing that must be submitted within 10 days, by anyone who acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of any publicly traded securities. A filer must promptly update its 13D filing in case of acquisition or disposition of 1% or more of the securities that are the subject of the filing. These filings may be a precursor to hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events.

Group Inc. 

  Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements

September
30, 2016

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 -
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY

 

CAT9 Group
Inc., (the “Company”) formerly ANDES 4
Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on January 26, 2015, and has been inactive since inception.
The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset
acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business
combination with a domestic or foreign business.

 

On July
31, 2015, the sole officer and director of the Company entered into
a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant to
which he entered into an agreement to sell an aggregate of
10,000,000 shares of his shares of the Company’s common stock
to Chongqing Field Industrial Company Ltd. at an aggregate
purchase price of $40,000. These shares represent 100% of the
Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Effective upon
the closing date of the Share Purchase Agreement, August 12, 2015,
the sole officer and director of the Company executed the agreement
and owned no shares of the Company’s stock and Chongqing
Field Industrial Company Ltd. was the sole stockholder of the
Company.

 

On May 2,
2016, the Company entered into Employee Agreements with Wenfa
"Simon" Sun, its President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman
of the Board of Directors, and MeiHong "Sanya" Qian, its Chief
Financial Officer and Secretary. Pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common
stock to Wenfa "Simon" Sun, and 4,000,000 shares of restricted
common stock to MeiHong "Sanya" Qian.

 

On May 3,
2016, the sole shareholder of the Company, Chongqing Field
Industrial Ltd., ("CQFI") consented to a redemption of its
10,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.0001 per share
for an aggregate redemption price of $1,000. As a result of this
action by CQFI, management of the Company now control 100% of the
issued and outstanding shares.

  

With the
redemption and subsequent issuance of the 10,000,000 shares of
restricted common stock, the Company effected a change in its
control and the new majority shareholders are the current members
of management of the Company.

 

NOTE 2 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

 

Basis of
presentation

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of CAT9 Group
Inc. have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements
for interim financial statements. Therefore, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for complete
financial statements. The financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements CAT9 Group Inc.
in our Form 10-12G/A2 filed on September 8, 2015.

 

The
interim unaudited financial statements present the balance sheet,
statements of operations and cash flows CAT9 Group Inc. The
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

 

 

 




-  8 
-




  

 




 




[Index]

The
interim financial information is unaudited. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of
operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in
the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal and
recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results of operations for the full year.

 

Use of
estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments
are based on historical information, information that is currently
available to the Company and on various other assumptions that the
Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with
original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash equivalents are
placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are
primarily in money market funds. The carrying value of those
investments approximates fair value.

 

Earnings
(loss) per share

Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been
issued. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the periods presented.

 

Stock-based
compensation

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the
receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ASC 718-10, Compensation – Stock
Compensation, and the conclusions reached by FASB ASC 505-50,
Equity – Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are
measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity
instruments issued for consideration other than employee services
is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or
completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as
defined by FASB ASC 505-50.

 

Income
taxes

The
Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on
the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the
extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the
assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

[Index]

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to
uncertainty income taxes.  Section 740-10-25 addresses the
determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be
claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements.  Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%)
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures.  The Company had
no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income
tax benefits according to the provisions of Section
740-10-25.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company has evaluated recent pronouncements through Accounting
Standards Updates (“ASU”) 2015-08 and believes that
none of them will have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

NOTE 3 -
GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and had a
deficit accumulated of $ 45,521 as of September 30, 2016. The
Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and
marketing activities. The Company’s ability to raise
additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is
unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful
development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations,
and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable
operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.
The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of these
aforementioned uncertainties.

 

NOTE 4 -
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

The
Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. While these forward-looking statements, and any
assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
