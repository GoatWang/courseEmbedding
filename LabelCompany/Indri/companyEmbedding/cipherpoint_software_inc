The videos aren't glossy marketing videos, just simple examples looking over the shoulder of someone actually using the product.

 PARTNER STORIES  "Keeping track of inventory across multiple e-commerce channels can be just as taxing as streamlining fulfillment for online retailers. By partnering with Finale Inventory, we can help alleviate these pain points for our customers.”
Robert Gilbreath, VP Marketing, ShipStation  CUSTOMER STORIES I would highly recommend Finale Inventory to any multi-channel retailer who wants to move beyond Excel spreadsheets to an easy, intuitive software solution to manage their inventory.

Illumination
I would definitely recommend the product to everyone. Its simplicity yet scalability and speed is exactly what every inventory manager or COO must have.

Finale has hundreds of customers in wide ranging industries. Below are some testimonials from some of our customers.
   
 Steve Leffer , CEO @ Chocoley Chocolate 

"I just wanted to drop you a quick note to tell you how pleased Chocoley is with using Finale as our inventory management system. Having been on the Finale system for the past year, we have been able to easily integrate our website, Chocoley.com, Shipstation, QuickBooks and Amazon.com for a seamless and accurate management of our inventory across all marketing & sales channels. Prior to using Finale, we were completely in the weeds and had nothing but problems managing our inventory. The idea of selling in different channels was a pipedream and thanks to Finale, it's not just a desire, but reality. 

If anyone is thinking about utilizing Finale, they should move forward, as it is the right decision. No costly software to buy and the customer support has truly been unbelievable... I am always amazed at how much time and energy you guys have provided in answering questions or helping new employees get indoctrinated into using the system... always with a great attitude and willingness to help and never making us feel like we're taking too much time...and not charging a dime for that added benefit is HUGE!!! 

'Thank you, thank you, thank you for providing a great product and awesome service at such a reasonable price. I can't imagine using anyone other than Finale for our inventory management system'.

   
 Omar Cordero, CEO and President @ Stronger Rx  

"Our business has been grown dramatically over the past few months, and we quickly realized we needed an inventory management solution to get control of our inventory. We leverage ShipStation for order fulfillment and found the Finale Inventory to be a perfect complement to keeping accurate stock counts. Going forward, I can focus on other aspects of the business as our inventory management operations is now more streamlined and efficient. 

The Finale team was also extremely helpful assisting us integrate Xero and a Magento POS solution to Finale Inventory as part of a comprehensive solution to manage our entire business. The customer service is second to none, and they're are easily accessible by email or phone. 

I would highly recommend Finale Inventory to any multi-channel retailer who wants to move beyond Excel spreadsheets to an easy, intuitive software solution to manage their inventory. "

Michael Walker, Brand Manager @ FHY Inc 

"We love the simplicity and efficiency of the program. It looks clean, is easy to navigate and is completely intuitive and easy to use, even for beginners. It isn't visually overwhelming and cluttered with too much "stuff", it is super simple yet very powerful.We started out with Finale a little over a year ago after spending several months researching every program on the market, reading reviews and really doing our due diligence before finally zeroing in on Finale. We have not looked back since. 

They are exceptionally attentive to our every need. If ever we have had a question, problem or a suggestion, they are super quick to respond (usually within minutes) and address it immediately. They have a super hands on approach and honestly seem to care about building a quality business by caring about their product and their customers.

Finale has truly changed the way we do business and increased our productivity and efficiency 100 times over. I mean we were literally in the dark ages before we started using Finale, we had no digital inventory control, we were updating online marketplace inventory manually every day, it was literally insanity with all the products we have, which is THOUSANDS. We are truly grateful for Finale and to their team and recommend it to anyone." 

   
Cheryl Farrell, Executive VP @ Integrated Logic 

"We are a logistics consulting company helping our small to mid-size clients manage their inventory. Initially, we were using Excel spreadsheets and spending countless hours manually tracking inventory receipts, sales orders, and inventory adjustments. Finale Inventory has enabled us to quit using multiple Excel spreadsheets and has provided us with the ability to answer questions, retrieve data, and run reports with just a few simple clicks. Processes that previously took hours were simplified down to seconds.

We have been so pleased with our implementation of Finale Inventory. It is extremely intuitive, easy to use and customizable to fit your particular business needs. As we have hired new employees, training on Finale Inventory is almost not necessary as it is very user-friendly and intuitive. New users are up and running in a matter of a few minutes." 

   
Joseph McClaren, Data Analyst@ Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis 

"We are part of a university research lab group that uses Finale to track supplies of biospecimen collection kits (builds) and lab supplies. The ability to create builds (to track individual components) for our kits is wonderful! Also, the ability to track lot identifiers and expiration dates is critical for lab reagents and things like blood collection vials. 

Having Finale Inventory has really helped as our group as we have grown. It's very easy to use and there are still numerous features that we haven't fully explored. Pricing is very reasonable as well. 

The customer service is FANTASTIC! The company really goes out of their way to make sure their customers are happy. I can't stress that enough. We have used Finale since late 2014 and are currently in the process to expand our use of it. We are very pleased with both the software and the tremendous customer service and user support." 

   
Chiman Lee, Director of Recompute @ Goodwill Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin counties 

"The software provides a simple solution to a common problem managing a single inventory through multi platform online sales channels - eBay, Amazon, and webstore - using Finale. It's easy to use for staff, smooth integration to Shipstation, easy integration with online platforms with more APIs in the works, and great tech support. Handheld scanner enables staff to add and remove inventory with ease." 

   
Robert Vaughn, Product Manager @ Lull Mattress 

"Finale is robust, flexible and easy to use; there are so many features that we use. We were struggling to find a system that did light manufacturing and tracked inventory for small businesses. I love that it's web based and every time I ask their support how to do something new, there is already a feature in place. The programs integration to ShipStation means that most of our inventory tracking is automated and we don't have to do much work. 

We are able to track our inventory accurately, keeping track of raw materials components and finished goods in one system. We're able to make quick inventory adjustments and easy manufacture finished goods. The integration with ShipStation makes our lives so easy because we only need to input purchases, and all of our shipments are tracked and inventory is made unavailable or decremented. 

I would recommend Finale Inventory if your company uses other web-based programs and would like to automate your inventory tracking." 

   
Kyle Maudlin, Quality Control Manager @ Intermountain Nutrition 

"Finale is an amazing tool that has helped us keep a huge client over the years! Chinh and the gang have been really great. They really take care of us as the customer and do whatever it takes after hours even to solve problems and answer questions. We very much appreciate the relationship that we have with Finale Inventory." 

   
Martin Bryan, Operations @ Deus Modern 

"Using the Finale inventory software with ShipStation integration has allowed our company to automate and streamline our order processing and inventory management, dramatically saving time and money. Finale does a wonderful job of allowing us to keep track and stay on top of ordering the multiple components that make up our products we sell. With a simple and direct approach, we were able to be up and running in an incredibly short amount of time. Finale's customer service has been very prompt and helpful. Highly recommend this software to anyone who is managing an inventory and looking to save time and money!" 

   
Chad Kidner, CEO @ Veil Entertainment and Production 

"Finale is the best online warehouse inventory software for the eCommerce business. We had 2 primary problems we were looking to solve with Finale. First to find a software the could seamlessly manage, track, and control our physical inventories being received, in addition to syncing up with our shipping software, to decrement these same inventories as they were sold. The second problem we were solving was also being able to manage supplier inventories of these same products, to easily reorder our products without interruption in our selling process. 

Finale has so far been the ONLY software, able to provide a solution that intricately encompassed each aspect of our needs. My company has tried many other options, and have even paid a higher premium for one that glamoured themselves in features, that ended up lacking in many basic necessities. None of these others were offering a full warehousing solution, flexible enough for the changing eCommerce business. 

If you're looking for a true online warehouse inventory management software, you've found it, don't waste anymore time, we've done that for you! Get it! You will not regret the decision." 

   
 Pat Bianchi, COO @ LOX Extensions 

"After setting up the company info, I was up and running in a few hours thanks to the easy import and export features. I did some trial and error testing with magazines and other features to streamline Finale to my needs, but it was effortless. Finale has really helped our business be more efficient. It has reduced counting errors to almost zero. It has also given me peace of mind in terms of inventory levels and value. I would definitely recommend the product to everyone. Its simplicity yet scalability and speed is exactly what every inventory manager or COO must have! "

Robert M @ HyperIce 

"Excellent product. Finale Inventory has an easy learning curve, intuitive and provides all the needed functionality we were looking for. It is a great web browser based tool to manage our components, assembly, warehousing and shipping from our warehouse in China. Great customer support and follow up, including with our team in China." 

   
Andres Orjuela, IT Manager @ Cables and Sensors 

"As our company transitions from being a start-up to a successful online business (made the Inc 500 fastest growing company list 2015) one of my 2015 tasks as IT manager was to look for a solid Inventory Software that would fit our needs and allow us to not only grow but improve the integration of all our processes. 

I spent 2 months looking at what is available and sat through countless demos, used many sample accounts, read documentation, and read reviews. I evaluated 38 systems.

The reasons we finally decided on Finale Inventory were many. Their user interface is clean and easy to use (leads to productivity). It is a system that doesn't try to promise you everything and the kitchen sink. What they do is manage inventory and they do it excellently. The pricing is competitive. Their built in integrations were seamless to connect. The API is complete and straight forward to work with. Their built in reports (highly customizable) are extensive and excellent. The customer service is outstanding.

If you are looking for inventory software, I recommend you give them a serious consideration. We could not be more satisfied. " 

   
Kim Cofer, Manager @ 2xhome 

"Finale is just the inventory tool we were looking for!' We needed a program that would like to our online shipping program to track and manage our inventory. We had previously been doing manual counts with excel spreadsheets so having this makes keeping track of inventory a lot easier, more efficient and accurate. Unlike some other programs we had researched, Finale Inventory handles our kitting needs without being overpriced. Customer service was on par. Highly recommended!" 

   
Harry Klaus, CEO @ Paragon America 

"I am a relative "newbie" to Finale but with the ease of use of the program, the complete and comprehensive, hands-on training I've received and the responsiveness of the staff, I am IMPRESSED. We began by using Finale to channel sales and inventory data from our websites to QB Enterprise. Step two was inventory control and the next steps will take us into a full-blown warehouse/inventory management system. Simply the best at any price!" 

   
Ryland Mansur, Product Manager @ Emerald Pool And Spa 

The best part about Finale Inventory is how easy it is to operate, it is by far the best Inventory System on the market. The Home page breaks your tasks down into separate columns making navigation unbelievably simplistic. Finale is Inexpensive, easy to comprehend and so easy to integrate all selling channels for your business; whether it be eBay, Amazon, BigCommerce, and Shipstation. Integration has been simplified to a point that surpasses any other inventory software on the market. Finale Inventory has been a huge change for our business, and we are excited to have them tracking our inventory. 

You will never want to use or have to use another Inventory System again. Finale is by far the easiest inventory system we have come across, and it has been wonderful being a part of such a respectful organization. They are always putting the customer before themselves, never making you feeling unimportant. We have been treated wonderful, and we are very pleased how they are focused on the customer. They ensure that the customer (us) is happy with their purchase. 

With other companies we were always skeptical, paranoid about the inventory tracking working, with Finale I never have to worry. Customer Service was another huge savior that Finale Inventory shines in. With other software programs, we were treated very poorly because we are a small business. Finale Inventory treats every customer wonderfully, always there when you need them and never putting calls or issues off to the side. The Customer Service is outstanding, if you have any claims or issues they immediately respond and always solving the problem before the ending of a training seminar or a phone call. Thank you Finale Inventory for being fantastic! 

   
Katelynn Dow, Operations Manager @ Sweet Water Decor 

"We love using Finale for our inventory system! It is so helpful to have a home base for all of the sales channels we use. We love that it immediately updates inventory on ALL sales channels to keep us from overselling! " 

   
Stacey Wells, Manager @ The Rag Company 

" My immediate first impression is the AMAZING positive customer support during implementation of Finale Inventory. The training, tutorials and available tools have provided an efficient way to resolve any questions when maintaining inventory with the Finale Inventory application. This company continues to expand its software features, and I look forward to more options as they grow. The integration with other software programs such as BigCommerce, ShipStation, and Square was a smooth process. I would highly recommend them when considering great customer service and an affordable inventory management system.”

   
Tom Swenson, GM @ NorthStar Fireworks 

"The Past Few years we have expanded our warehouse and Business to multiple Locations. We needed to find an Inventory System that would allow us to grow and manage our inventory. Finale staff was great to help us through all the steps of switching over to Finale Inventory. Even after we were set up and running, they maintain their relationship helping us use Finale to its full capacity, and always been there to answer questions."

We just had our ATF inspections last week, and the inspectors loved the reports Finale Inventory produced. They were able to get their job done efficiently and we were back to work quickly Thank You FINALE." 

   
Michael DiLeo, Owner@ Sneaky Pete Holsters 

"To embrace hyperbole for a moment, Finale Inventory is 'just right'. Every time I thought it might lack some important feature I discovered that the feature was there, just one level deeper down so that it didn't clutter the user interface. This is important because the software is robust to say the least, without being cluttered or discouraging. 

The best part of the entire system (for me) is the copy and paste ease with which you can manipulate data. If you need to make a change to multiple skus, you need only open a spreadsheet and create a few columns with the data you want to add or change. Copy and paste that data into Finale and then assign each column to match with where you need it to go and you're done. 

I could probably go on and on, but I'll end on this. Support so far has been stellar and there are MANY videos that the creators have posted to YouTube that allow you to quickly learn every aspect of the system. We were up and running in an hour, and as we dived into using Finale we never felt lost or overwhelmed. If you manage a business with inventory and Finale Inventory is compatible with your software, you'd do well to give it a hard look." 

   
 Cody Henderson, Founder @ Beetstech 

"It's not perfect, but none of them are. But Finale is the the best inventory management software I've used thus far. One of the biggest areas of praise I can think of, is that I set up Shipstation and four different sales channels in a weekend. I've used countless (at least eight) other inventory management softwares, and none have been as intuitive and quick to set up. 

Because Finale integrates with Shipstation (and Shipstation integrates with near everything), Finale also integrates with practically everything that Shipstation integrates with. So our eBay, Amazon, WooCommerce, and Newegg transactions are all pulled into Finale. If we decide to start selling on other marketplaces, or change our website from WooCommerce to another eCommerce platform, Finale will almost certainly support them, because Shipstation does. This is one of the biggest challenges we've faced as an online retailer, and Finale handles it with ease. " 

   
 Ben Harper, Manager @ The USA Trailer Store 

"We use Finale to control inventory across 10 different sales channels, each with different selling profiles. We have individual products sold separately on one site which are sold together as a kit on another. Some of our channels sell products as options, others as individual SKUs. Finale handles all of this with a clean interface and minimal headache. My first impression was a bit hesitant as some features weren't readily apparent but a large part of that was finding the specific feature out of all the powerful tools available. And whenever we have had any questions/issues, customer service has been AMAZING. Finale does everything we need it to and does it extremely well. " 

   
 Antonio Carrera, COO @ GoVacuum.com 

"Finale Inventory's seamless integration with ShipStation has allowed our business to quickly integrate our accounts without major configuration. As a major online and brick and mortar retailer, we needed a simple solution to manage our inventory across multiple channels. A major challenge for us was managing multiple SKU's that were associated to the same product across several marketplaces. Finale's ability to easily assign multiple SKU's to a single product ID, as well as the ability to handle product bundles or "kits" has significantly reduced our inventory complexity. Add to this world-class customer service, and you have a recipe for inventory success. I highly recommend Finale Inventory to any multi-channel online retailer. " 

   
James Lai, President @ Cutting Chair, Inc. 

"After months of testing and trialing every inventory management software and system on the market, Finale has been such a blessing! From the very first day of signing up, the Finale owner and team have been extremely helpful and responsive to any and every one of our questions or concerns. 

If you use ShipStation (in our opinion the best shipping management software), this is where Finale’s strength is. It flawlessly syncs with ShipStation ensuring that you only ship products that are in stock and order out-of-stock items. 

Finale gives you the things you want in an inventory management software without all the fluff. We tried other solutions that tried to be an all-in-one solution, but they all end up being mediocre services. Regular updates of the software leave our team comfortable knowing that as a system, Finale is always pushing for optimal streamlined cutting edge performance and integrations. We are elated to be using Finale and already have accounts for both of our companies. " 

   
Stav Bar-Sheshet @ Antelope Shoes 

"Finale is the best SMB inventory available on the market! We've reviewed 13 different cloud-based software solutions and found many of the platforms had lots of connection problems with Magento, in addition to missing information when syncing to ShipStation. Finale integration works great. All the order information comes right to ShipStation and then to Finale to sync inventory to the other marketplaces almost instantly. They have a dedicated team that it is a pleasure to contact in any case or problem, and any software have some. We hope Finale will keep grow and improve and wish them all the best." 

   
Dev Robertson, Process Improvement @ Brown Box 

"I've been looking for an inventory management program for our company for a few years and wasn't having much luck until I looked into Finale. They provide a clean interface that is quick and web based which is nice. The setup was rather easy and their customer service team helps out whenever I have questions about the program and also have added features when possible. Of all the programs I've reviewed, I would highly recommend Finale to handle your online market inventory for sure! " 

   
Reid Campbell, Owner @ Parts Haven 

"Finale Inventory has really allowed us to effectively manage our warehouse. We are on a service plan level that provided one on one help setting up the system and believe it was worth the extra money. We have been using the service for almost two years and our happy on all fronts. As an FYI for us, the real part that separates Finale from other WMS systems are the handheld scanners. No other system in this price range offers this functionality and it is a great time saver. Their customer service is great but not needing to drag a laptop or a funky smartphone solution through the warehouse is a game changer." 

   
Kyle Palmer, Logistic @ Sock101 

"I hit a few snags while trying to set up integration, but their team was extremely patient with me and very helpful when guiding me through the process. I would recommend Finale to anyone. They also respond very quickly to emails and questions. " 

   
Mohammad Salamah, General Manager @ O&M Electronics Inc 

"Finale offers inventory management for your online selling channels as well as warehouse. Easy to use. Mobile device solution for picking, receiving...etc. You can customize product/stock screen view and add/remove filters to see what you need. Lots of features and ability to customize. Overall very satisfied. " 

   
Justin Jackrel, Founder @ Bintelli Scooters 

"Finale has saved our parts department. What was once a mess from start to finish is now organized. The team at Finale has been amazing at helping us customize the program to suit our needs. I have recommended this to every person I know. Simply the best money we have spent on Technology in years. " 

   
Derrick Pack, Owner @ Pack King 

"Finale has done great solving the main need we had, that is, a centralized inventory that is synced across multiple selling platforms. They worked with us to be one of the first customers syncing to Amazon.co.uk which was great. There have only been a few selling platforms they do not yet support but we are hoping to come soon. It is limited in the fact you cannot centralize listings/data and push those out (only inventory stock levels), but for the cost of the product, this was understood. We still love it and plan to continue using it going forward." 

   
JD Patton, Project Manager @ Patton Kiehl Group 

"Great flexible system. Our warehouse was a mess before implementing Finale Inventory. Since implementing the software, we have only had to walk the racks 2 or 3 times due to operator error, and with the reporting we know exactly where to focus the search. Prior to using Finale, it was a weekly occurrence." 

   
Nate Garland, President @ Samoco Industries 

"Finale allowed us to trade a bunch of messy, mind-boggling Excel spreadsheets with dozens of tabs for a powerful program that tracks our inventory in real time, even while we are sleeping. Our spreadsheets were outdated the minute we completed them and required constant updating and babysitting. The time we spent slaving over spreadsheets can now be used to focus on researching and adding new products. Gone are the fears of accidentally opening an older version of a spreadsheet, plus ShipStation integration and Finale work together seamlessly in the background with minimal input required." 

   
Jesse Torres, Warehouse Manager @ Rayno Film 

"Rayno Window Film is a leading producer of window tinting film for automotive, home, and commercial applications. Before Finale, it was excruciating to keep track of our window film within Excel as each roll has its own serial number. Finale’s integrated mobile barcode scanner solution and its ability to track serial numbers has significantly reduced our inventory management complexity and streamlined our warehouse operations. I simply scan the serial number of the roll, and I am done! As an added bonus, we were able print professional looking barcode labels within Finale without having to buy additional label printing software. 

Best of all, if I ever get stuck with something that does not make sense to me in Finale, someone is always available to help me with the issue. Everyone I’ve ever dealt with has always been so knowledgeable and helpful.  I would highly recommend Finale to any company who has challenges tracking serial numbers. " 

   
Susan Hair, Fulfillment @ Bastion 

"Just wanted to pop in electronically and let you know that both Mike and I are real happy with Finale and the ShipStation integration so far. Now that we have our inventory system (product codes, etc.) cleaned up and functioning better, we are able to experience the full benefits of Finale’s features. It’s been very helpful in enabling our co-location (in two separate time zones) to work pretty flawlessly so far with inventory control and purchasing. 

Thank you for all your help and patience in our start-up with Finale. Our current productivity is measurably improved … and more importantly,  we are very confident that we can begin to implement expansion goals knowing that Finale will help us scale up without a problem. " 

   
Sharon, Operations Manager @ Ontario Beer Kegs 

"Finale is a cost effective way to control our inventory. Through their wireless barcode scanning system, we have increased both productivity and accuracy. Using the scanner's "guided picking" feature, order picking is a breeze and easy for old and new employees to understand as the scanner determines the most efficient picking order and guides them to the correct standard bin where each product is located. The Finale team is always very helpful and understanding whenever I have issues." 

   
Roman Iomdin, Inventory Manager @ Houseables 

"My experience with Finale Inventory has been a pleasant one. Before using Finale, I was able to sample a dozen inventory cloud management companies, and none of these were able to fully provide me with what I needed. Either important features were missing or the cost didn't make sense. 

On the other hand, Finale Inventory has been able to provide me with the tools I need to accurately track my warehouse inventory, creates purchase orders, create/map bundles(kits) for online sales of multiple products, keep track of sales, etc. Although I did run into a few issues in the beginning, they were mostly my fault (due to not understanding how to use Finale). Everything else was quickly resolved through customer service (including prompt replies to answer any question I may have had)" 

   
Charity Ambrose, Manager @ Legit Supplements 

"I've compared MANY different Inventory Platforms before landing on Finale. What ultimately sold me was the incredible value they punched for the price. I had several criteria that I needed to fulfill for our startup company, several of which were matched in other inventory platforms, but NEVER all of them. Once I found Finale and how they fulfilled all of our needs, I thought it was too good to be true, but it wasn't. I needed the peace of mind to know that we would have support and access to lots of learning resources. Not only did they provide this, but they set up several one hour training phone chats which were invaluable. " 

   
Katrina Spencer, Project Manager @ iRemedy Healthcare 

"I have had a great experience. A very smooth transition from Brightpearl and any questions that I have are immediately answered by Chinh. Great vendor!" 

   
Mark Williams @ SuperBody Breakthrough 

"'We use Shopify, Clickfunnels and Shipstation. Most inventory softwares want their software to be the first point that the order hits (In effect, Shopify/Clickfunnels > Inventory software > Shipstation). Well that works great for Shopify, but not very well for Clickfunnels. Finale does it flawlessly. Finale gets the job done just the same. 

   
Martin C. @ IBS Flight Cases 

"Finale provides great service. We were allocated a support engineer using Skype who has proved to be extremely patient and highly supportive no matter the hour or day. Software has a simple clean interface, has a very fast cloud response, and does exactly what it says it does." 

   
Jason Garcia, Owner @ Workt 

"My favorite part is that Finale Inventory tracks multiple skus from different sales channels. It is awesome. Exactly what I need." 

   
Todd Spendley, Director of Warehouse & Fulfillment @ World Tran Services 

"While launching an in-house fulfillment center for a mid-sized brand management and marketing company, I ran into a major obstacle using a competitive product. We were attempting to accurately debit and report sales post-shipping. A competitor of Finale, recommended by ShipStation, told me I was "using their system incorrectly" and could not offer a solution to support our simple, quick and efficient method of processing high volume orders. After speaking with several of ShipStation's recommended IMS providers, Finale was the only one who said "yes" and gave us what we needed. Set up & integration was quick and seamless and I could not be happier with the ease of use and reporting. The ongoing support I receive from the Finale team has made me a raving fan!" 

   
Gregory A. Friedman, CEO @ AireBeam 

"Finale Inventory is worth its weight in gold. Saves everyone in our organization involved with products a ton of time and keeps me from running out of critical goods thus enabling us to grow continuously." 

   
 Brad Heibert, Business Owner @ Sears Home Services 

"Everything is going quite well with the mobile barcode scanner solution. It took longer to implement and train my guys on the system, but fortunately we now have a good handle on it all. I am excited and relieved to be able to use Finale to efficiently manage my inventory, and I'm now expanding the barcode scanning solution to our other facilities. As always, thanks for the help and support. " 

   
Eli M @ Machine Shop Pros 

"Finale is the best inventory software. The process was so easy as far as setup and getting it live. After it was all live, using the software was seamless. Finale allows you to manage all your online selling channels all the time. I am now able to avoid underselling or overselling." 

   
 Sam Zimmerman, Operations Manager @ Tri-County Seeds 

"Using Finale has been one of the best decisions we have made in our company. We deal with many products in a short and fast time period and was using spreadsheets to track it all. With Finale we no longer need spread sheets and I can look and see where our products are when billing time begins. Best time saver for our company. " 

   
 Miguel Landaverde, @ California Fuel and Lubricants 

"With its simple approach, Finale gets the job done. Great customer service, very accessible professional people at your service. Easy to get up and running while offering many features. If you want to control your inventory with a no non-sense approach and ease of use you can’t go wrong with Finale. " 

   
 Robert Fenton, Operation Manager @ Miami Restaurant Supplies 

"I used to do stock takes with pen and paper. Using Finale and a mobile barcode scanner I get it done in half the time. Last Saturday I never would have finished doing stock takes for my 60 sublocations without the scanner and Finale. A must have for any small business looking to save time with inventory management. " 

   
 Crystal Campbell, Director @ One Grace Place 

"I just wanted to reach out to your team to say, THANK YOU! You guys have been so awesome helping us get all set-up and going, training our team, and even rewriting your program to help us integrate with Quickbooks. Amazing. We're so excited to have things working. We have some kinks to work out, then I expect it will be smooth sailing.Thank you again for your excellent customer service, and your amazing software. We're happy customers. :)" 

   
 Teresa Winfield, Program Manager @ Happy Bottoms 

"We are a small nonprofit diaper bank that distributes diapers to over 1500 kids through 28 nonprofit agencies each month. Using Finale to track our incoming diaper donations and purchases, as well as our outgoing distributions, has greatly improved our inventory accuracy and efficiency. The Finale team is always available to answer questions and help us build custom reports to meet our more specialized needs. " 

   
 Brittany Crespo, Manager @ Pacific Utility Contractors 

"Finale Inventory Software has made inventory control in our warehouses very efficient. Since using this program our inventory has been easier to track, and ordering has become simpler. We use this inventory system to track all materials that are brought in and taken out of both of our warehouses, and notify our managers and billing personnel of materials that have been placed on job sites. Their relationship managers has been extremely helpful in helping us learn the software and has assisted us with several trainings. " 

   
Tricia Travis, Operations @ Luna Press 

"I would definitely recommend Finale. The customer service was fantastic. Mike and the whole team went above and beyond to customize our account to best fit our needs. They were patient, professional, accommodating, and super accessible whenever we had issues." 

   
Christian Howard, Director @ Howard and Sons 

"Importing our data and training our staff was far easier than we imagined. Just cut and paste from Excel. We've used Finale now for two years as our order management system and warehouse management system. Outshines other inventory control systems and asset tracking software for manufacturing hands down." 

   
Tim Souza, Corporate Controller @ Gemvara 

"We use Finale to track thousands of individual pieces of jewelry in addition to hundreds of parcels of gemstones. The system's flexibility is endless!  

   
Jake Keohen, Controller@ RES Inc 

Our company used to track our inventory manually, using a series of Excel Spreadsheets. We converted to Finale Inventory in January of 2013 and I could not be more pleased. It has saved me countless hours due to the fact that I am not duplicating steps anymore. Once we have uploaded a sales order into the software Finale does the rest of the work for me. I no longer have to worry about making keypunch errors. I'm also saving time because Finale generates a bill of lading for each order. And the reports feature is simple to customize to meet my every need. Finale was very easy for us to learn and the technical support offered by their staff is second to none. 

   
David Rosenbaum, President @ |Illumination 

"We've tried ERP systems at ten times the cost. We've tried Quickbooks inventory management and other stock control software. We've been on Finale for almost three years as our inventory tracking software. Finale is the only cloud stock control system that had the depth of functionality to be used as order management software and warehouse management software while still being intuitive. " 

   
Brian Panther, President@ Hi-Tech FX LLC

 "I have been very pleased with Finale Inventory. There have been a few bumps along the way but I expected that given the large size of our company and the multiple sites we manage. But the guys at Finale have been very responsive to problems and have been great about soliciting feedback and implementing suggestions into the product. Its definitely and evolving project, but I can see a day when we can finally do everything inside one application. 

   
 Kevin Paglusch, Director of Operations @ Gateway Displays  

"Finale Inventory is a powerful, economical inventory system. The program is used for many facets of our business. The guys at Finale are always listening to their customers and constantly making the system better, without pricing the application beyond the reach of the small business. Their customer service is beyond reproach. Most if not all their questions are answered in an hour or less. " 

   
 Tony Cartolano, President @ Pyrotechnic Display 

" I have products and employees in 6 states. Having access to inventory from all places was very important to us. Also we have most users on Mac's, Some on PC's and a Few on Tablets. We needed something that was cloud based, and would work with all these people/places and devices. We have been using FInale for three years, it has grown, developed and become the backbone of our business. All our employees know it, love it and live in it all day. The company has always been receptive to our suggestions and many of our ideas have come to the actual product. " 

   
 Bruce Albrecht, Operations Manager @ Hawaii Pyrotechnics 

Excellent customer service, with requirements implemented quickly and recommendations implemented frequently. Easy to get up and running while offering a great many features. It is also very responsive for a cloud-based app with all the advantages of portability and simplicity.

CipherPoint Access Control















































 















Centralized Permissions Management for Unstructured DataThe CipherPoint Eclipse Access Control Module provides role- and attribute- based access control (RBAC, ABAC) and rights management capabilities for securing access to files and emails. The Access Control Modules provides simple and flexible access policies, and operate in a “default deny” fashion – even restricting access by IT administrator accounts.
Role-based access control are simple lists of user and/or groups that are authorized to access and view information. Attributed-based access control uses metadata about the user (subject) and the data (object) to make a dynamic, item-level access decision. Rights management allows granular control of the ability to copy, print, save, or forward email messages and attachments.

Data Privacy and Compliance for Higher Education














































 















Security and Compliance for PII, ePHI, & Sensitive Research Information 



Education Data Security Challenge
Higher Education institutions embody the ideals of intellectual creativity and freedom. The decentralized nature of these environments, however, present challenges in managing information security. While preserving this freedom is a top priority it is also increasingly important for higher education institutions to deploy cost-effective and user transparent security controls to maintain compliance with regulations such as FERPA, HIPAA, ITAR, etc. and as sophisticated attackers target advanced research information. Collaboration within and between institutions adds another layer of complexity in securing sensitive data.
 
CipherPoint Eclipse Solutions for Education Institutions
The CipherPoint Eclipse suite allows IT organizations to provide an appropriate level of top-down risk management and security control while not impacting the individual empowerment of departments and research projects. Through the ability to quickly and easily assess and reduce the risk of regulated or proprietary information, CipherPoint Eclipse gives IT departments the ability to provide a higher level of service to their internal stakeholders by allowing expanded use of popular platforms such as SharePoint, Office 365, and OneDrive Pro for Business.
 The suite includes the following functionality to help higher education institutions reduce risk and meet regulatory compliance:
 

Content Scanning – Identify risk through scanning SharePoint and other platforms for information that requires additional security
Transparent Encryption – Securing information using transparent data at rest encryption of documents and lists (i.e. web forms and tables)
Access Control – Enforcing mandatory access control lists in order to balance the needs of users with enforcement of privacy policies
Activity Logging – Granular audit of all permitted and denied access requests to secured data in order to alert of suspicious behavior and more quickly and accurately respond to incidents




Visit the products pages to learn more about CipherPoint’s data security solutions for the platforms that your organization is using to store sensitive data.

PHIPA













































 
















Find, Secure, & Track Patient Information




PHIPA Data Security Challenge
The healthcare and related industries are embracing collaboration in order to reduce costs of medical care. Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365 / SharePoint Online are the market leaders for team collaboration.  The challenge, however, is to secure SharePoint, Office 365, and SharePoint Online for use cases that involve electronic Protected Healthcare Information (ePHI) and other regulated or sensitive data.
The adoption of SharePoint and Office 365 for storing patient information within the healthcare field is growing. In the healthcare industry, payers and providers must comply with the requirements found in the HIPAA and HITECH Acts relating to providing adequate security and privacy for Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). These requirements include such technical controls as user authentication, authorization, access control, encryption, data integrity, and audit logging.
 
CipherPoint Eclipse Solutions for PHIPA
The CipherPoint Eclipse for Healthcare solution for PHIPA, HIPAA, HITECH and other patient privacy compliance delivers the controls healthcare organizations need to secure their patient and other sensitive information, and to meet their compliance requirements. CipherPoint’s solution for healthcare organizations helps them to meet access control, system activity reporting, transparent encryption, and automated key management requirements, in a single, easy to deploy solution that is centrally managed and transparent to end-users.
 



CipherPoint Eclipse Abilities
The CipherPoint Eclipse for Healthcare helps healthcare and other organizations ensure patient privacy:
 

Enable Compliance – Enables compliance with PHIPA, HIPAA HITECH, and other patient privacy initiatives
Supports Multiple Platforms – Supports SharePoint, file servers, SharePoint Online, Office 365, and other cloud platforms
Identify Sensitive Data – Identifies electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other patient data
Encryption – Provides data at rest encryption and key management in accordance with NIST 800-111 for safe harbor from breach disclosure
Audit and Log – Audits all access requests to patient information to more quickly identify and response to suspicious behavior
Control Insider Access – Optionally controls access to patient information so that SharePoint and other IT administrators can manage patient information but cannot view it.

DENVER, May 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CipherPoint Software, Inc., provider of data security for platforms such as Microsoft SharePoint and Office365, today announced the availability of CipherPoint Eclipse™ Data Security API in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

With the Data Security API, organizations have the ability to identify, secure, and audit any sensitive data in the Cloud. As businesses accelerate the adoption of Microsoft Azure for custom applications, SharePoint farms and other use cases, they can utilize CipherPoint Eclipse data security capabilities for any Azure workload or cloud application to maintain their data security and privacy compliance posture. Further, CipherPoint Eclipse for Microsoft Office 365, which utilizes the API, will also be available in the Microsoft SharePoint App Store in the near future.
"Securing data in your cloud applications should be front and center," says CipherPoint CEO Mike Fleck, "and encryption with integrated access control is critical to preventing data breaches. By enhancing the data security available from and for the Microsoft Cloud, we have made it incredibly convenient to provide data security as a web service for any sensitive data in Microsoft Azure."
The CipherPoint Eclipse data security platform which underlies the API includes a centralized security policy manager and the ability to enforce policies using software agents, cloud security gateways and API clients. The platform provides data discovery, transparent encryption at rest and in use, role-based and attribute-based access controls, and real-time activity logging. CipherPoint seamlessly secures information as it moves among data center, private and public cloud use cases.
The Azure Marketplace is an online market for buying and selling finished Software as a Service (SaaS) applications and premium datasets. "In today's environment, our mutual customers rely on proactive and automated security and compliance controls such as CipherPoint Eclipse to help keep data private," said Nicole Herskowitz, senior director of product marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp. "We are pleased that CipherPoint has taken this step to make its solutions available from Microsoft Azure to provide additional data security and privacy compliance capabilities." 
About CipherPoint Software:  CipherPoint centrally identifies, secures, and audits access to sensitive and regulated unstructured data on-premises and in the cloud. The CipherPoint solution is unique in keeping privileged IT administrators and outside attackers that target IT level access from being able to view sensitive information. CipherPoint products are easy to deploy and manage, and scalable to meet the needs of large organizations. For more information, visit http://www.cipherpoint.com/msazure/.

 PARTNER STORIES  "Keeping track of inventory across multiple e-commerce channels can be just as taxing as streamlining fulfillment for online retailers. By partnering with Finale Inventory, we can help alleviate these pain points for our customers.”
Robert Gilbreath, VP Marketing, ShipStation  CUSTOMER STORIES I would highly recommend Finale Inventory to any multi-channel retailer who wants to move beyond Excel spreadsheets to an easy, intuitive software solution to manage their inventory.

Illumination
I would definitely recommend the product to everyone. Its simplicity yet scalability and speed is exactly what every inventory manager or COO must have.

Finale has hundreds of customers in wide ranging industries. Below are some testimonials from some of our customers.
   
 Steve Leffer , CEO @ Chocoley Chocolate 

"I just wanted to drop you a quick note to tell you how pleased Chocoley is with using Finale as our inventory management system. Having been on the Finale system for the past year, we have been able to easily integrate our website, Chocoley.com, Shipstation, QuickBooks and Amazon.com for a seamless and accurate management of our inventory across all marketing & sales channels. Prior to using Finale, we were completely in the weeds and had nothing but problems managing our inventory. The idea of selling in different channels was a pipedream and thanks to Finale, it's not just a desire, but reality. 

If anyone is thinking about utilizing Finale, they should move forward, as it is the right decision. No costly software to buy and the customer support has truly been unbelievable... I am always amazed at how much time and energy you guys have provided in answering questions or helping new employees get indoctrinated into using the system... always with a great attitude and willingness to help and never making us feel like we're taking too much time...and not charging a dime for that added benefit is HUGE!!! 

'Thank you, thank you, thank you for providing a great product and awesome service at such a reasonable price. I can't imagine using anyone other than Finale for our inventory management system'.

   
 Omar Cordero, CEO and President @ Stronger Rx  

"Our business has been grown dramatically over the past few months, and we quickly realized we needed an inventory management solution to get control of our inventory. We leverage ShipStation for order fulfillment and found the Finale Inventory to be a perfect complement to keeping accurate stock counts. Going forward, I can focus on other aspects of the business as our inventory management operations is now more streamlined and efficient. 

The Finale team was also extremely helpful assisting us integrate Xero and a Magento POS solution to Finale Inventory as part of a comprehensive solution to manage our entire business. The customer service is second to none, and they're are easily accessible by email or phone. 

I would highly recommend Finale Inventory to any multi-channel retailer who wants to move beyond Excel spreadsheets to an easy, intuitive software solution to manage their inventory. "

Michael Walker, Brand Manager @ FHY Inc 

"We love the simplicity and efficiency of the program. It looks clean, is easy to navigate and is completely intuitive and easy to use, even for beginners. It isn't visually overwhelming and cluttered with too much "stuff", it is super simple yet very powerful.We started out with Finale a little over a year ago after spending several months researching every program on the market, reading reviews and really doing our due diligence before finally zeroing in on Finale. We have not looked back since. 

They are exceptionally attentive to our every need. If ever we have had a question, problem or a suggestion, they are super quick to respond (usually within minutes) and address it immediately. They have a super hands on approach and honestly seem to care about building a quality business by caring about their product and their customers.

Finale has truly changed the way we do business and increased our productivity and efficiency 100 times over. I mean we were literally in the dark ages before we started using Finale, we had no digital inventory control, we were updating online marketplace inventory manually every day, it was literally insanity with all the products we have, which is THOUSANDS. We are truly grateful for Finale and to their team and recommend it to anyone." 

   
Cheryl Farrell, Executive VP @ Integrated Logic 

"We are a logistics consulting company helping our small to mid-size clients manage their inventory. Initially, we were using Excel spreadsheets and spending countless hours manually tracking inventory receipts, sales orders, and inventory adjustments. Finale Inventory has enabled us to quit using multiple Excel spreadsheets and has provided us with the ability to answer questions, retrieve data, and run reports with just a few simple clicks. Processes that previously took hours were simplified down to seconds.

We have been so pleased with our implementation of Finale Inventory. It is extremely intuitive, easy to use and customizable to fit your particular business needs. As we have hired new employees, training on Finale Inventory is almost not necessary as it is very user-friendly and intuitive. New users are up and running in a matter of a few minutes." 

   
Joseph McClaren, Data Analyst@ Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis 

"We are part of a university research lab group that uses Finale to track supplies of biospecimen collection kits (builds) and lab supplies. The ability to create builds (to track individual components) for our kits is wonderful! Also, the ability to track lot identifiers and expiration dates is critical for lab reagents and things like blood collection vials. 

Having Finale Inventory has really helped as our group as we have grown. It's very easy to use and there are still numerous features that we haven't fully explored. Pricing is very reasonable as well. 

The customer service is FANTASTIC! The company really goes out of their way to make sure their customers are happy. I can't stress that enough. We have used Finale since late 2014 and are currently in the process to expand our use of it. We are very pleased with both the software and the tremendous customer service and user support." 

   
Chiman Lee, Director of Recompute @ Goodwill Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin counties 

"The software provides a simple solution to a common problem managing a single inventory through multi platform online sales channels - eBay, Amazon, and webstore - using Finale. It's easy to use for staff, smooth integration to Shipstation, easy integration with online platforms with more APIs in the works, and great tech support. Handheld scanner enables staff to add and remove inventory with ease." 

   
Robert Vaughn, Product Manager @ Lull Mattress 

"Finale is robust, flexible and easy to use; there are so many features that we use. We were struggling to find a system that did light manufacturing and tracked inventory for small businesses. I love that it's web based and every time I ask their support how to do something new, there is already a feature in place. The programs integration to ShipStation means that most of our inventory tracking is automated and we don't have to do much work. 

We are able to track our inventory accurately, keeping track of raw materials components and finished goods in one system. We're able to make quick inventory adjustments and easy manufacture finished goods. The integration with ShipStation makes our lives so easy because we only need to input purchases, and all of our shipments are tracked and inventory is made unavailable or decremented. 

I would recommend Finale Inventory if your company uses other web-based programs and would like to automate your inventory tracking." 

   
Kyle Maudlin, Quality Control Manager @ Intermountain Nutrition 

"Finale is an amazing tool that has helped us keep a huge client over the years! Chinh and the gang have been really great. They really take care of us as the customer and do whatever it takes after hours even to solve problems and answer questions. We very much appreciate the relationship that we have with Finale Inventory." 

   
Martin Bryan, Operations @ Deus Modern 

"Using the Finale inventory software with ShipStation integration has allowed our company to automate and streamline our order processing and inventory management, dramatically saving time and money. Finale does a wonderful job of allowing us to keep track and stay on top of ordering the multiple components that make up our products we sell. With a simple and direct approach, we were able to be up and running in an incredibly short amount of time. Finale's customer service has been very prompt and helpful. Highly recommend this software to anyone who is managing an inventory and looking to save time and money!" 

   
Chad Kidner, CEO @ Veil Entertainment and Production 

"Finale is the best online warehouse inventory software for the eCommerce business. We had 2 primary problems we were looking to solve with Finale. First to find a software the could seamlessly manage, track, and control our physical inventories being received, in addition to syncing up with our shipping software, to decrement these same inventories as they were sold. The second problem we were solving was also being able to manage supplier inventories of these same products, to easily reorder our products without interruption in our selling process. 

Finale has so far been the ONLY software, able to provide a solution that intricately encompassed each aspect of our needs. My company has tried many other options, and have even paid a higher premium for one that glamoured themselves in features, that ended up lacking in many basic necessities. None of these others were offering a full warehousing solution, flexible enough for the changing eCommerce business. 

If you're looking for a true online warehouse inventory management software, you've found it, don't waste anymore time, we've done that for you! Get it! You will not regret the decision." 

   
 Pat Bianchi, COO @ LOX Extensions 

"After setting up the company info, I was up and running in a few hours thanks to the easy import and export features. I did some trial and error testing with magazines and other features to streamline Finale to my needs, but it was effortless. Finale has really helped our business be more efficient. It has reduced counting errors to almost zero. It has also given me peace of mind in terms of inventory levels and value. I would definitely recommend the product to everyone. Its simplicity yet scalability and speed is exactly what every inventory manager or COO must have! "

Robert M @ HyperIce 

"Excellent product. Finale Inventory has an easy learning curve, intuitive and provides all the needed functionality we were looking for. It is a great web browser based tool to manage our components, assembly, warehousing and shipping from our warehouse in China. Great customer support and follow up, including with our team in China." 

   
Andres Orjuela, IT Manager @ Cables and Sensors 

"As our company transitions from being a start-up to a successful online business (made the Inc 500 fastest growing company list 2015) one of my 2015 tasks as IT manager was to look for a solid Inventory Software that would fit our needs and allow us to not only grow but improve the integration of all our processes. 

I spent 2 months looking at what is available and sat through countless demos, used many sample accounts, read documentation, and read reviews. I evaluated 38 systems.

The reasons we finally decided on Finale Inventory were many. Their user interface is clean and easy to use (leads to productivity). It is a system that doesn't try to promise you everything and the kitchen sink. What they do is manage inventory and they do it excellently. The pricing is competitive. Their built in integrations were seamless to connect. The API is complete and straight forward to work with. Their built in reports (highly customizable) are extensive and excellent. The customer service is outstanding.

If you are looking for inventory software, I recommend you give them a serious consideration. We could not be more satisfied. " 

   
Kim Cofer, Manager @ 2xhome 

"Finale is just the inventory tool we were looking for!' We needed a program that would like to our online shipping program to track and manage our inventory. We had previously been doing manual counts with excel spreadsheets so having this makes keeping track of inventory a lot easier, more efficient and accurate. Unlike some other programs we had researched, Finale Inventory handles our kitting needs without being overpriced. Customer service was on par. Highly recommended!" 

   
Harry Klaus, CEO @ Paragon America 

"I am a relative "newbie" to Finale but with the ease of use of the program, the complete and comprehensive, hands-on training I've received and the responsiveness of the staff, I am IMPRESSED. We began by using Finale to channel sales and inventory data from our websites to QB Enterprise. Step two was inventory control and the next steps will take us into a full-blown warehouse/inventory management system. Simply the best at any price!" 

   
Ryland Mansur, Product Manager @ Emerald Pool And Spa 

The best part about Finale Inventory is how easy it is to operate, it is by far the best Inventory System on the market. The Home page breaks your tasks down into separate columns making navigation unbelievably simplistic. Finale is Inexpensive, easy to comprehend and so easy to integrate all selling channels for your business; whether it be eBay, Amazon, BigCommerce, and Shipstation. Integration has been simplified to a point that surpasses any other inventory software on the market. Finale Inventory has been a huge change for our business, and we are excited to have them tracking our inventory. 

You will never want to use or have to use another Inventory System again. Finale is by far the easiest inventory system we have come across, and it has been wonderful being a part of such a respectful organization. They are always putting the customer before themselves, never making you feeling unimportant. We have been treated wonderful, and we are very pleased how they are focused on the customer. They ensure that the customer (us) is happy with their purchase. 

With other companies we were always skeptical, paranoid about the inventory tracking working, with Finale I never have to worry. Customer Service was another huge savior that Finale Inventory shines in. With other software programs, we were treated very poorly because we are a small business. Finale Inventory treats every customer wonderfully, always there when you need them and never putting calls or issues off to the side. The Customer Service is outstanding, if you have any claims or issues they immediately respond and always solving the problem before the ending of a training seminar or a phone call. Thank you Finale Inventory for being fantastic! 

   
Katelynn Dow, Operations Manager @ Sweet Water Decor 

"We love using Finale for our inventory system! It is so helpful to have a home base for all of the sales channels we use. We love that it immediately updates inventory on ALL sales channels to keep us from overselling! " 

   
Stacey Wells, Manager @ The Rag Company 

" My immediate first impression is the AMAZING positive customer support during implementation of Finale Inventory. The training, tutorials and available tools have provided an efficient way to resolve any questions when maintaining inventory with the Finale Inventory application. This company continues to expand its software features, and I look forward to more options as they grow. The integration with other software programs such as BigCommerce, ShipStation, and Square was a smooth process. I would highly recommend them when considering great customer service and an affordable inventory management system.”

   
Tom Swenson, GM @ NorthStar Fireworks 

"The Past Few years we have expanded our warehouse and Business to multiple Locations. We needed to find an Inventory System that would allow us to grow and manage our inventory. Finale staff was great to help us through all the steps of switching over to Finale Inventory. Even after we were set up and running, they maintain their relationship helping us use Finale to its full capacity, and always been there to answer questions."

We just had our ATF inspections last week, and the inspectors loved the reports Finale Inventory produced. They were able to get their job done efficiently and we were back to work quickly Thank You FINALE." 

   
Michael DiLeo, Owner@ Sneaky Pete Holsters 

"To embrace hyperbole for a moment, Finale Inventory is 'just right'. Every time I thought it might lack some important feature I discovered that the feature was there, just one level deeper down so that it didn't clutter the user interface. This is important because the software is robust to say the least, without being cluttered or discouraging. 

The best part of the entire system (for me) is the copy and paste ease with which you can manipulate data. If you need to make a change to multiple skus, you need only open a spreadsheet and create a few columns with the data you want to add or change. Copy and paste that data into Finale and then assign each column to match with where you need it to go and you're done. 

I could probably go on and on, but I'll end on this. Support so far has been stellar and there are MANY videos that the creators have posted to YouTube that allow you to quickly learn every aspect of the system. We were up and running in an hour, and as we dived into using Finale we never felt lost or overwhelmed. If you manage a business with inventory and Finale Inventory is compatible with your software, you'd do well to give it a hard look." 

   
 Cody Henderson, Founder @ Beetstech 

"It's not perfect, but none of them are. But Finale is the the best inventory management software I've used thus far. One of the biggest areas of praise I can think of, is that I set up Shipstation and four different sales channels in a weekend. I've used countless (at least eight) other inventory management softwares, and none have been as intuitive and quick to set up. 

Because Finale integrates with Shipstation (and Shipstation integrates with near everything), Finale also integrates with practically everything that Shipstation integrates with. So our eBay, Amazon, WooCommerce, and Newegg transactions are all pulled into Finale. If we decide to start selling on other marketplaces, or change our website from WooCommerce to another eCommerce platform, Finale will almost certainly support them, because Shipstation does. This is one of the biggest challenges we've faced as an online retailer, and Finale handles it with ease. " 

   
 Ben Harper, Manager @ The USA Trailer Store 

"We use Finale to control inventory across 10 different sales channels, each with different selling profiles. We have individual products sold separately on one site which are sold together as a kit on another. Some of our channels sell products as options, others as individual SKUs. Finale handles all of this with a clean interface and minimal headache. My first impression was a bit hesitant as some features weren't readily apparent but a large part of that was finding the specific feature out of all the powerful tools available. And whenever we have had any questions/issues, customer service has been AMAZING. Finale does everything we need it to and does it extremely well. " 

   
 Antonio Carrera, COO @ GoVacuum.com 

"Finale Inventory's seamless integration with ShipStation has allowed our business to quickly integrate our accounts without major configuration. As a major online and brick and mortar retailer, we needed a simple solution to manage our inventory across multiple channels. A major challenge for us was managing multiple SKU's that were associated to the same product across several marketplaces. Finale's ability to easily assign multiple SKU's to a single product ID, as well as the ability to handle product bundles or "kits" has significantly reduced our inventory complexity. Add to this world-class customer service, and you have a recipe for inventory success. I highly recommend Finale Inventory to any multi-channel online retailer. " 

   
James Lai, President @ Cutting Chair, Inc. 

"After months of testing and trialing every inventory management software and system on the market, Finale has been such a blessing! From the very first day of signing up, the Finale owner and team have been extremely helpful and responsive to any and every one of our questions or concerns. 

If you use ShipStation (in our opinion the best shipping management software), this is where Finale’s strength is. It flawlessly syncs with ShipStation ensuring that you only ship products that are in stock and order out-of-stock items. 

Finale gives you the things you want in an inventory management software without all the fluff. We tried other solutions that tried to be an all-in-one solution, but they all end up being mediocre services. Regular updates of the software leave our team comfortable knowing that as a system, Finale is always pushing for optimal streamlined cutting edge performance and integrations. We are elated to be using Finale and already have accounts for both of our companies. " 

   
Stav Bar-Sheshet @ Antelope Shoes 

"Finale is the best SMB inventory available on the market! We've reviewed 13 different cloud-based software solutions and found many of the platforms had lots of connection problems with Magento, in addition to missing information when syncing to ShipStation. Finale integration works great. All the order information comes right to ShipStation and then to Finale to sync inventory to the other marketplaces almost instantly. They have a dedicated team that it is a pleasure to contact in any case or problem, and any software have some. We hope Finale will keep grow and improve and wish them all the best." 

   
Dev Robertson, Process Improvement @ Brown Box 

"I've been looking for an inventory management program for our company for a few years and wasn't having much luck until I looked into Finale. They provide a clean interface that is quick and web based which is nice. The setup was rather easy and their customer service team helps out whenever I have questions about the program and also have added features when possible. Of all the programs I've reviewed, I would highly recommend Finale to handle your online market inventory for sure! " 

   
Reid Campbell, Owner @ Parts Haven 

"Finale Inventory has really allowed us to effectively manage our warehouse. We are on a service plan level that provided one on one help setting up the system and believe it was worth the extra money. We have been using the service for almost two years and our happy on all fronts. As an FYI for us, the real part that separates Finale from other WMS systems are the handheld scanners. No other system in this price range offers this functionality and it is a great time saver. Their customer service is great but not needing to drag a laptop or a funky smartphone solution through the warehouse is a game changer." 

   
Kyle Palmer, Logistic @ Sock101 

"I hit a few snags while trying to set up integration, but their team was extremely patient with me and very helpful when guiding me through the process. I would recommend Finale to anyone. They also respond very quickly to emails and questions. " 

   
Mohammad Salamah, General Manager @ O&M Electronics Inc 

"Finale offers inventory management for your online selling channels as well as warehouse. Easy to use. Mobile device solution for picking, receiving...etc. You can customize product/stock screen view and add/remove filters to see what you need. Lots of features and ability to customize. Overall very satisfied. " 

   
Justin Jackrel, Founder @ Bintelli Scooters 

"Finale has saved our parts department. What was once a mess from start to finish is now organized. The team at Finale has been amazing at helping us customize the program to suit our needs. I have recommended this to every person I know. Simply the best money we have spent on Technology in years. " 

   
Derrick Pack, Owner @ Pack King 

"Finale has done great solving the main need we had, that is, a centralized inventory that is synced across multiple selling platforms. They worked with us to be one of the first customers syncing to Amazon.co.uk which was great. There have only been a few selling platforms they do not yet support but we are hoping to come soon. It is limited in the fact you cannot centralize listings/data and push those out (only inventory stock levels), but for the cost of the product, this was understood. We still love it and plan to continue using it going forward." 

   
JD Patton, Project Manager @ Patton Kiehl Group 

"Great flexible system. Our warehouse was a mess before implementing Finale Inventory. Since implementing the software, we have only had to walk the racks 2 or 3 times due to operator error, and with the reporting we know exactly where to focus the search. Prior to using Finale, it was a weekly occurrence." 

   
Nate Garland, President @ Samoco Industries 

"Finale allowed us to trade a bunch of messy, mind-boggling Excel spreadsheets with dozens of tabs for a powerful program that tracks our inventory in real time, even while we are sleeping. Our spreadsheets were outdated the minute we completed them and required constant updating and babysitting. The time we spent slaving over spreadsheets can now be used to focus on researching and adding new products. Gone are the fears of accidentally opening an older version of a spreadsheet, plus ShipStation integration and Finale work together seamlessly in the background with minimal input required." 

   
Jesse Torres, Warehouse Manager @ Rayno Film 

"Rayno Window Film is a leading producer of window tinting film for automotive, home, and commercial applications. Before Finale, it was excruciating to keep track of our window film within Excel as each roll has its own serial number. Finale’s integrated mobile barcode scanner solution and its ability to track serial numbers has significantly reduced our inventory management complexity and streamlined our warehouse operations. I simply scan the serial number of the roll, and I am done! As an added bonus, we were able print professional looking barcode labels within Finale without having to buy additional label printing software. 

Best of all, if I ever get stuck with something that does not make sense to me in Finale, someone is always available to help me with the issue. Everyone I’ve ever dealt with has always been so knowledgeable and helpful.  I would highly recommend Finale to any company who has challenges tracking serial numbers. " 

   
Susan Hair, Fulfillment @ Bastion 

"Just wanted to pop in electronically and let you know that both Mike and I are real happy with Finale and the ShipStation integration so far. Now that we have our inventory system (product codes, etc.) cleaned up and functioning better, we are able to experience the full benefits of Finale’s features. It’s been very helpful in enabling our co-location (in two separate time zones) to work pretty flawlessly so far with inventory control and purchasing. 

Thank you for all your help and patience in our start-up with Finale. Our current productivity is measurably improved … and more importantly,  we are very confident that we can begin to implement expansion goals knowing that Finale will help us scale up without a problem. " 

   
Sharon, Operations Manager @ Ontario Beer Kegs 

"Finale is a cost effective way to control our inventory. Through their wireless barcode scanning system, we have increased both productivity and accuracy. Using the scanner's "guided picking" feature, order picking is a breeze and easy for old and new employees to understand as the scanner determines the most efficient picking order and guides them to the correct standard bin where each product is located. The Finale team is always very helpful and understanding whenever I have issues." 

   
Roman Iomdin, Inventory Manager @ Houseables 

"My experience with Finale Inventory has been a pleasant one. Before using Finale, I was able to sample a dozen inventory cloud management companies, and none of these were able to fully provide me with what I needed. Either important features were missing or the cost didn't make sense. 

On the other hand, Finale Inventory has been able to provide me with the tools I need to accurately track my warehouse inventory, creates purchase orders, create/map bundles(kits) for online sales of multiple products, keep track of sales, etc. Although I did run into a few issues in the beginning, they were mostly my fault (due to not understanding how to use Finale). Everything else was quickly resolved through customer service (including prompt replies to answer any question I may have had)" 

   
Charity Ambrose, Manager @ Legit Supplements 

"I've compared MANY different Inventory Platforms before landing on Finale. What ultimately sold me was the incredible value they punched for the price. I had several criteria that I needed to fulfill for our startup company, several of which were matched in other inventory platforms, but NEVER all of them. Once I found Finale and how they fulfilled all of our needs, I thought it was too good to be true, but it wasn't. I needed the peace of mind to know that we would have support and access to lots of learning resources. Not only did they provide this, but they set up several one hour training phone chats which were invaluable. " 

   
Katrina Spencer, Project Manager @ iRemedy Healthcare 

"I have had a great experience. A very smooth transition from Brightpearl and any questions that I have are immediately answered by Chinh. Great vendor!" 

   
Mark Williams @ SuperBody Breakthrough 

"'We use Shopify, Clickfunnels and Shipstation. Most inventory softwares want their software to be the first point that the order hits (In effect, Shopify/Clickfunnels > Inventory software > Shipstation). Well that works great for Shopify, but not very well for Clickfunnels. Finale does it flawlessly. Finale gets the job done just the same. 

   
Martin C. @ IBS Flight Cases 

"Finale provides great service. We were allocated a support engineer using Skype who has proved to be extremely patient and highly supportive no matter the hour or day. Software has a simple clean interface, has a very fast cloud response, and does exactly what it says it does." 

   
Jason Garcia, Owner @ Workt 

"My favorite part is that Finale Inventory tracks multiple skus from different sales channels. It is awesome. Exactly what I need." 

   
Todd Spendley, Director of Warehouse & Fulfillment @ World Tran Services 

"While launching an in-house fulfillment center for a mid-sized brand management and marketing company, I ran into a major obstacle using a competitive product. We were attempting to accurately debit and report sales post-shipping. A competitor of Finale, recommended by ShipStation, told me I was "using their system incorrectly" and could not offer a solution to support our simple, quick and efficient method of processing high volume orders. After speaking with several of ShipStation's recommended IMS providers, Finale was the only one who said "yes" and gave us what we needed. Set up & integration was quick and seamless and I could not be happier with the ease of use and reporting. The ongoing support I receive from the Finale team has made me a raving fan!" 

   
Gregory A. Friedman, CEO @ AireBeam 

"Finale Inventory is worth its weight in gold. Saves everyone in our organization involved with products a ton of time and keeps me from running out of critical goods thus enabling us to grow continuously." 

   
 Brad Heibert, Business Owner @ Sears Home Services 

"Everything is going quite well with the mobile barcode scanner solution. It took longer to implement and train my guys on the system, but fortunately we now have a good handle on it all. I am excited and relieved to be able to use Finale to efficiently manage my inventory, and I'm now expanding the barcode scanning solution to our other facilities. As always, thanks for the help and support. " 

   
Eli M @ Machine Shop Pros 

"Finale is the best inventory software. The process was so easy as far as setup and getting it live. After it was all live, using the software was seamless. Finale allows you to manage all your online selling channels all the time. I am now able to avoid underselling or overselling." 

   
 Sam Zimmerman, Operations Manager @ Tri-County Seeds 

"Using Finale has been one of the best decisions we have made in our company. We deal with many products in a short and fast time period and was using spreadsheets to track it all. With Finale we no longer need spread sheets and I can look and see where our products are when billing time begins. Best time saver for our company. " 

   
 Miguel Landaverde, @ California Fuel and Lubricants 

"With its simple approach, Finale gets the job done. Great customer service, very accessible professional people at your service. Easy to get up and running while offering many features. If you want to control your inventory with a no non-sense approach and ease of use you can’t go wrong with Finale. " 

   
 Robert Fenton, Operation Manager @ Miami Restaurant Supplies 

"I used to do stock takes with pen and paper. Using Finale and a mobile barcode scanner I get it done in half the time. Last Saturday I never would have finished doing stock takes for my 60 sublocations without the scanner and Finale. A must have for any small business looking to save time with inventory management. " 

   
 Crystal Campbell, Director @ One Grace Place 

"I just wanted to reach out to your team to say, THANK YOU! You guys have been so awesome helping us get all set-up and going, training our team, and even rewriting your program to help us integrate with Quickbooks. Amazing. We're so excited to have things working. We have some kinks to work out, then I expect it will be smooth sailing.Thank you again for your excellent customer service, and your amazing software. We're happy customers. :)" 

   
 Teresa Winfield, Program Manager @ Happy Bottoms 

"We are a small nonprofit diaper bank that distributes diapers to over 1500 kids through 28 nonprofit agencies each month. Using Finale to track our incoming diaper donations and purchases, as well as our outgoing distributions, has greatly improved our inventory accuracy and efficiency. The Finale team is always available to answer questions and help us build custom reports to meet our more specialized needs. " 

   
 Brittany Crespo, Manager @ Pacific Utility Contractors 

"Finale Inventory Software has made inventory control in our warehouses very efficient. Since using this program our inventory has been easier to track, and ordering has become simpler. We use this inventory system to track all materials that are brought in and taken out of both of our warehouses, and notify our managers and billing personnel of materials that have been placed on job sites. Their relationship managers has been extremely helpful in helping us learn the software and has assisted us with several trainings. " 

   
Tricia Travis, Operations @ Luna Press 

"I would definitely recommend Finale. The customer service was fantastic. Mike and the whole team went above and beyond to customize our account to best fit our needs. They were patient, professional, accommodating, and super accessible whenever we had issues." 

   
Christian Howard, Director @ Howard and Sons 

"Importing our data and training our staff was far easier than we imagined. Just cut and paste from Excel. We've used Finale now for two years as our order management system and warehouse management system. Outshines other inventory control systems and asset tracking software for manufacturing hands down." 

   
Tim Souza, Corporate Controller @ Gemvara 

"We use Finale to track thousands of individual pieces of jewelry in addition to hundreds of parcels of gemstones. The system's flexibility is endless!  

   
Jake Keohen, Controller@ RES Inc 

Our company used to track our inventory manually, using a series of Excel Spreadsheets. We converted to Finale Inventory in January of 2013 and I could not be more pleased. It has saved me countless hours due to the fact that I am not duplicating steps anymore. Once we have uploaded a sales order into the software Finale does the rest of the work for me. I no longer have to worry about making keypunch errors. I'm also saving time because Finale generates a bill of lading for each order. And the reports feature is simple to customize to meet my every need. Finale was very easy for us to learn and the technical support offered by their staff is second to none. 

   
David Rosenbaum, President @ |Illumination 

"We've tried ERP systems at ten times the cost. We've tried Quickbooks inventory management and other stock control software. We've been on Finale for almost three years as our inventory tracking software. Finale is the only cloud stock control system that had the depth of functionality to be used as order management software and warehouse management software while still being intuitive. " 

   
Brian Panther, President@ Hi-Tech FX LLC

 "I have been very pleased with Finale Inventory. There have been a few bumps along the way but I expected that given the large size of our company and the multiple sites we manage. But the guys at Finale have been very responsive to problems and have been great about soliciting feedback and implementing suggestions into the product. Its definitely and evolving project, but I can see a day when we can finally do everything inside one application. 

   
 Kevin Paglusch, Director of Operations @ Gateway Displays  

"Finale Inventory is a powerful, economical inventory system. The program is used for many facets of our business. The guys at Finale are always listening to their customers and constantly making the system better, without pricing the application beyond the reach of the small business. Their customer service is beyond reproach. Most if not all their questions are answered in an hour or less. " 

   
 Tony Cartolano, President @ Pyrotechnic Display 

" I have products and employees in 6 states. Having access to inventory from all places was very important to us. Also we have most users on Mac's, Some on PC's and a Few on Tablets. We needed something that was cloud based, and would work with all these people/places and devices. We have been using FInale for three years, it has grown, developed and become the backbone of our business. All our employees know it, love it and live in it all day. The company has always been receptive to our suggestions and many of our ideas have come to the actual product. " 

   
 Bruce Albrecht, Operations Manager @ Hawaii Pyrotechnics 

Excellent customer service, with requirements implemented quickly and recommendations implemented frequently. Easy to get up and running while offering a great many features. It is also very responsive for a cloud-based app with all the advantages of portability and simplicity.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
