Cassiopesa Search Browser Removal Report


































				Cassiopesa Search Browser			

Cassiopesa Search Browser Description
The Cassiopesa Search is associated with a browser hijacker and used to deliver advertisements and force computer users to click on affiliate marketing links and similar content. When computer users try to carry out an online search on the Cassiopesa Search, the search results may be completely irrelevant, composed almost entirely of advertisements and sponsored links rather than of relevant search results.
The Cassiopesa Search is Associated with a Browser Hijacker
If the Cassiopesa Search existed by itself, the Cassiopesa Search would pose no kind of threat; computer users would simply avoid visiting this website. However, the Cassiopesa Search is associated with a browser hijacker. This browser hijacker that may take the form of a Web browser extension or add-on tries to force PC users to visit the Cassiopesa Search repeatedly. The browser hijacker may change the affected Web browser's default search engine and homepage to the Cassiopesa Search automatically. Attempting to revert these changes to their default settings, may prove unsuccessful. 
The Cassiopesa Search and Its Associated Browser Hijacker
Browser hijackers associated with the Cassiopesa Search may affect most Web browsers. Problems involving the Cassiopesa Search have been observed on Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and other popular Web browsers. Once the browser hijacker is installed, the affected Web browser's homepage may be changed to the Cassiopesa Search automatically. Computer users that try to use the affected Web browser may be forced to visit the Cassiopesa Search repeatedly. Pop-up windows and messages associated with the Cassiopesa Search also may appear repeatedly, interfering with the computer user's activities. The Cassiopesa Search may be associated with a number of other irritating symptoms. This may include the appearance of unwanted advertisements on Web pages viewed on the affected Web browser and various type of performance issues. For example, the affected Web browser may become slow, unstable or prone to freezing or crashing. 
The Cassiopesa Search is Designed to Generate Revenue at the Expense of Computer Users
The Cassiopesa Search may be used to make money from advertising and affiliate marketing at the expense of computer users. Although advertisements are a legitimate way of making money, components like the Cassiopesa Search may force their advertisements on computer users, either by making the affected Web browser visit the Cassiopesa Search or by forcing it to display advertisements in pop-up windows and new tabs. Another way computer users may be forced to interact with the Cassiopesa Search is by changing the affected Web browser's default search engine and homepage to the Cassiopesa Search automatically. This ensures that computer users are forced to view the Cassiopesa Search as soon as the affected Web browser starts up. One problem that has come up with the Cassiopesa Search and similar low-quality search engines is that many of their advertisements and fake search results may promote known online tactics. For example, the Cassiopesa Search may be linked to advertisements for fake technical support services and bogus security programs. 
Symptoms that may be Linked to the Cassiopesa Search
The following are examples of symptoms and issues that may be associated with the Cassiopesa Search: 

The Cassiopesa Search may be linked to high volumes of pop-up messages and advertisements on affected Web browsers.
The Cassiopesa Search may be associated with severe performance issues due to the browser hijacker's use of memory, processing power and bandwidth while running in the background.
The Cassiopesa Search may be linked to changes to affected Web browsers' settings, with the inability to undo these changes normally.
The Cassiopesa Search may interfere with security software and other programs on the affected computer. This, coupled with the various performance problems, may make it quite difficult for computer users to remove browser hijackers associated with the Cassiopesa Search from the affected computer without resorting to Safe Mode or similar features.

					Threat Scorecard
					?
						
							The ESG Threat Scorecard is an assessment report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our Malware Research Center. The ESG Threat Scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends, incidents and severity over time.
							
							In addition to the effective scoring for each threat, we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat. The data used for the ESG Threat Scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a 30-day period. The ESG Threat Scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats.
							
							Each of the fields listed on the ESG Threat Scorecard, containing a specific value, are as follows:
							
Ranking: The current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database.
							
Threat Level: The level of threat a particular PC threat could have on an infected computer. The threat level is based on a particular threat's behavior and other risk factors. We rate the threat level as low, medium or high. The different threat levels are discussed in the SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.
							
Infected PCs: The number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected PCs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by SpyHunter's Spyware Scanner.
							
% Change: The daily percent change in the frequency of infected PCs of a specific threat. The formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat. An increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain. When a specific threat's ranking decreases, the percentage rate reflects its recent decline. For a specific threat remaining unchanged, the percent change remains in its current state. The % Change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges, in the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. Next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does, either upward or downward, in the rankings. Each level of movement is color coded: a green up-arrow (∧) indicates a rise, a red down-arrow (∨) indicates a decline, and a brown equal symbol (=) indicates no change or plateaued.
							
Top 3 Countries Infected: Lists the top three countries a particular threat has targeted the most over the past month. This data allows PC users to track the geographic distribution of a particular threat throughout the world.
