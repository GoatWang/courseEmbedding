Sen. Evan Bayh, a former two-term governor of Indiana (1989-1997) and U.S. senator (1999-2011), serves as a strategic advisor to many of the firm's most significant clients, particularly those whose business goals are impacted by the actions of Congress, the executive branch, or by governors and legislators across the country. 
Sen. Bayh joins McGuireWoods after voters from his home state of Indiana overwhelmingly elected him to two consecutive terms in the U.S. Senate. As a moderate Democrat, he was a leader, working in a bipartisan manner to seek consensus on several key issues, including financial services reform and healthcare. He was also a leading voice advocating fiscal restraint on government spending. Sen. Bayh served on several committees, including Armed Services; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; Aging; and Senate Intelligence.
Prior to being elected to the Senate, he was elected to two terms as governor of Indiana, where he enacted welfare reform, cut taxes, and brought about fiscal discipline to the state's budget. He also served as Secretary of State in Indiana (1986-1989). Sen. Bayh received his bachelor’s degree in business with honors from Indiana University in 1978, and received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981. In 1982, Sen. Bayh clerked for the Honorable Judge James E. Noland of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
In addition to his practice at McGuireWoods, Sen. Bayh is a senior advisor at Apollo Global Management in New York. Sen. Bayh serves on the board of directors for Fifth Third Bank, Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Berry Plastics Corporation, RLJ Lodging Trust, and McGraw Hill Education. He also serves on the advisory board for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Stuart Rothenberg  By Stuart Rothenberg  July 14, 2016      Evan Bayh wants back in the Senate, raising questions about why he left in the first place. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)  On Tuesday, my colleague at PowerPost, James Hohmann, opened his daily morning newsletter, The Daily 202, with this blistering critique of former Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, who formally announced yesterday he is running for his old Senate seat: One of the many reasons that so many of his Democratic colleagues did not like Evan Bayh during his tenure in the Senate was his excessive caution. The hyper-ambitious, always-privileged and ever-calculating son of a senator long dreamed of becoming president, and he represented a conservative-leaning state. So he was perennially nervous about taking tough votes or courageous stands. He often seemed to waffle and have his finger in the wind. I’d agree Bayh has always been cautious, and he had his sights set on the White House for years. But if ambition were disqualifying for those seeking high office, we wouldn’t have any candidates or elected officials, and I don’t regard caution as a terribly bad trait, especially considering some of the bone-headed decisions elected officials make. But Bayh’s decision certainly caught me off-guard, as did Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s decision to jump into the Florida Senate race after earlier announcing he would not seek re-election. And the Indiana Democrat’s announcement has made me re-consider my earlier view that Bayh didn’t retire in 2010 because he was afraid of losing to Republican challenger Dan Coats, himself a former senator who didn’t run for re-election because he was afraid he would lose to Bayh. Now, that conclusion is inescapable. Like everyone else, I had heard rumors over the past few months that Indiana and national Democrats were again urging Bayh to run for the Senate. So I checked with him a couple of times about his level of interest – or lack of interest – in possibly running for his old Indiana seat. Given those conversations, I was pretty sure I knew how he felt and what he thought about serving in the Senate again. He hated the idea. Unequivocally. Emphatically. No ifs ands or buts. I got the clear impression he had no interest returning to an institution crippled by political gridlock and no interest in returning to the partisan political wars, which have become more bitter and nasty over the past two decades. (Shades of Rubio again.) But now, at the last minute, Evan Bayh suddenly has decided the Senate needs him, or the country can’t live without him. So, former Rep. Baron Hill, and old Bayh ally, drops his Senate bid — which had been underwhelming so far – to allow the Indiana Democratic Party to fill the vacancy with Bayh. (Shades of Rubio, again, except Rubio made his decision before the Florida primary and faces a wealthy primary opponent.) What did Bayh say to explain his shift? “With the challenges facing Indiana and our country, I can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as partisan bickering grinds Washington to a halt. Hoosier families deserve more and I’ve decided to run to take their cause to the U.S. Senate,” said the 60-year old St Albans-educated former governor and senator in a press release formally announcing his decision. Ahh. I see. Not really. So, Bayh left the Senate because of the partisanship, bickering and gridlock. And now, he wants his old Senate seat back because of – you guessed it – the partisanship, bickering and gridlock. Sure, I believe that. And I believe in the tooth fairy too. Of course, Bayh’s decision to run surely was made easier by the fact that he has over $9 million in his campaign account and will be able to run less than a four-month race. Even if he doesn’t like to idea of having to spend a few months campaigning back in Indiana, it won’t be much of a burden. But while Bayh starts at least even in the race (or probably with a slight advantage), don’t put the Hoosier State in the Democratic column quite yet. Bayh, who was first elected Indiana secretary of state 30 years ago, has not had a competitive race since his 1988 gubernatorial contest, when he defeated John Mutz, the state’s two-term lieutenant governor, 53 percent to 47 percent. Bayh was re-elected governor by 25 points in 1992, elected to the Senate by 29 points in 1998 and re-elected to the Senate by 24 points in 2004. They were all laughers that were never competitive – unlike this year’s contest. But Bayh’s opponent this time is Todd Young, a former Marine who graduated from the United States Naval Academy, and has an MBA from the University of Chicago and a law degree from the University of Indiana. He was elected to Congress three times (the first in 2010), and won this year’s GOP Senate nomination by handily defeating fellow congressman Marlin Stutzman, a tea party favorite, on May 3rd. Young raised $3.7 million through the middle of April according to his pre-primary FEC report, and he looked to be the clear favorite for November. While Bayh’s entry into the race changes things, Young won’t roll over against Bayh, and national Republican strategists have more ammunition against Bayh than they did during his past races. His residence will be an issue when Republicans note his various homes and argue his connection to Indiana these days is, well, thin at best. And they will surely paint the race as a choice between tomorrow and yesterday. Finally, they are almost certain to stress the larger choice involved, linking Bayh to Clinton, Obama and Democratic control of the Senate in 2016. On one hand, the Senate could use a few more pragmatists (like Bayh and Rubio) who are willing to work across the aisle and believe a legislator’s job is to legislate. On the other hand, flip-flopping the way Bayh and Rubio have done only encourages cynicism about politicians and their personal ambitions. For Evan Bayh, his decision to run this year, like his 2010 decision, is not exactly a profile in courage.         powerpost  powerpost     false endOfArticle true          Please provide a valid email address.

2016

The race for Indiana's Senate seat was one of nine competitive battleground races in 2016 that helped Republicans maintain control of the Senate. Senator-elect Todd Young (R) defeated former Sen. Evan Bayh (D), entrepreneur and Secretary of the Hamilton County Libertarian Party Lucy Brenton (L), and James Johnson (Write-in) in the general election to win retiring incumbent Dan Coats' (R) Senate seat on November 8, 2016.[3][4][5]
Ballotpedia initially rated the race for Indiana's Senate seat as safely Republican, but it became a battleground race when Bayh entered the race. Young was expected to easily defeat former U.S. Rep. Baron Hill (D), but Hill exited the race on July 11, 2016, to give Democrats a better chance at winning Indiana with Bayh as the party's nominee.[1]
Bayh, a well-known candidate whose family was active in Indiana politics for decades, became the frontrunner as soon as he entered the race, but missteps caused his lead over Young in the polls to narrow.[6][7]
Republicans accused Bayh of abandoning Indiana by citing reports that showed he was considered an inactive voter in August 2016 by the Indiana Election Division. Republicans also accused Bayh of abandoning the state because he owned two multimillion-dollar homes in Washington, D.C., where he spent most of his time.[8][9]
While on the campaign trail, Bayh discussed his decision to return to politics and run for his old Senate seat, saying, "I think a lot of what you see going on at the national level is a primal scream at Washington, saying, 'Enough already. You've got to change your ways. Business as usual isn't good enough anymore.' That's a sentiment I share. Business as usual isn't good enough anymore. One of the reasons I'm running is to try to change that."[10]
Young tried to undercut Bayh’s message by portraying him as a Washington insider and positioning himself as someone who has always been loyal to the Hoosier state. During a campaign stop, Young said, “What I’m hearing from people across the board is they are frustrated by their elected representatives going to Washington, D.C., and forgetting about Indiana. They believe special interests and Washington lobbyists — like Evan Bayh — are a big part of the problem, and they’re right.”[11]
In his victory speech, Young said, "I learned in the marines [sic] to put people before politics. Tonight you proved the Indiana senate seat belongs to the people of indiana [sic]. This is your seat. This is your seat."[12]

The following issues were listed on Bayh's campaign website. 



 “


Agriculture: Hundreds of thousands of Hoosier jobs count on Indiana’s growing agricultural economy.  Yet, many farmers feel threatened by Washington regulation.  For Indiana to succeed, we need a Senator who will be a voice for farmers in Washington and fight unnecessary regulation on family farms. Evan Bayh is a fifth generation Hoosier and the proud grandson of a farmer.  True to his family, Evan Bayh will be a friend and ally for farmers, promoting policies that will help farmers succeed and get their product to market.
Medicare and Social Security: America has made a commitment to take care of our seniors.  For Evan Bayh, it is unacceptable to compromise the promises that we’ve made to them by cutting historically important programs like Medicare and Social Security. As Indiana’s next Senator, Evan will champion Social Security and Medicare, fulfilling the pledge that we’ve made to those who came before us.  
Jobs: Small businesses are the engine of our economy and we need to focus our attention on advancing policies that help them grow and prosper. … Evan believes in encouraging the creation of new small businesses and easing the burden on successful ones seeking to expand and create more good-paying jobs. In the Senate, Evan will fight to reduce regulations and increase access to capital for small business owners so that they can grow their organization, and encourage long-term investments in new technologies and equipment.  Evan’s plan will incentivize opportunities for research and development, making Hoosier workers more productive.  For Evan, when it comes to supporting Hoosier businesses, it doesn’t matter if an idea is a Republican idea or a Democratic idea, what matters is that it’s a good idea.
National Security: As Indiana’s Senator, Evan Bayh will make obliterating ISIS and eliminating the root causes of terrorism a top priority.  Evan will fight for intensifying the airstrike campaign against ISIS, promoting global partnership in the war against terror, and expanding the network of our intelligence community. At home, it is essential that America bolster its domestic intelligence and make sure that first responders are fully equipped and trained to keep us safe.  Our national security forces must have the resources necessary to root out lone wolves before they choose to act. Evan is committed to supporting America’s longtime ally Israel by getting tough on Iran.  In 2009 Evan sponsored tough new sanctions on Iran, and last year he broke with his own party to oppose the President’s nuclear deal.
Education: Evan Bayh knows that America can’t continue to ignore the rising costs of a college education.  America needs innovators and entrepreneurs to have big ideas and dream big dreams to keep America ahead.  During his time as Governor, Evan created the 21st Century Scholars program.  It made college affordable and drove students to succeed.  The program had students commit to success in the eighth grade, requiring a B average and a clean record. Indiana needs its brightest stars to shine and the 21st Century Scholars program encourages more stars to shine even brighter — more than 70,000 Hoosier stars to date. Evan believes that the 21st Century Scholars program was one of his greatest achievements as Governor.  As Indiana’s next Senator, he’s committed to creating similar opportunities for students nationwide and making sure that no good student has to turn down college because they can’t afford it.

MORE INFORMATION:
Former US Sen. Evan Bayh is running for the seat opened by Sen. Dan Coates’ (R-IN) retirement. Bayh was US Senator from 1999 until he decided not to seek reelection in 2010, citing gridlock and partisanship in Congress. He had previously served as Governor, and was known for passing large tax cuts. He most recently worked for a lobbying firm in Washington, DC, where he has advised many groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and in March of this year, before deciding to run for Senate, became co-chair of the No Labels group, which calls itself a “national movement of Democrats, Republicans and independent voters dedicated to a new politics of problem solving.”


On the Issues: Coming from such a red state, Bayh arguably can only win as a moderate. When he left Congress, he was ranked the most conservative Democratic Senator in the 111th Congress, voting with the party 72% of the time, though he had voted with the party 84% in the 110th and 91% in the 109th. While he is not strong on climate issues, we believe he will be in the right place for key votes. He is vocal in his disdain for the current campaign finance system, and has the potential to be a champion on the issue. His voting history on budget and tax issues is not great, but we see an opportunity to push him here.


Election update (9/27): Bayh entered the race late, in July of 2016, but brought with him a campaign war chest of nearly $10M from before his 2010 retirement. Shortly after he announced, a poll showed him winning by double digits. Although the race has tightened due to outside spending by GOP groups, Bayh is still expected to win, thanks to his high name recognition and approval rating.

Sen. Evan Bayh Joins McGuireWoods
January 31, 2011
Evan Bayh, the former two-term Governor of Indiana and United States Senator 
from 1999 to 2011, has joined McGuireWoods as a partner in the firm’s Washington 
office, the firm announced today. Senator Bayh will serve as a strategic advisor 
to the firm’s most significant domestic and international clients, particularly 
those whose business goals are impacted by public policy, the actions of 
Congress, the executive branch, or by governors and legislatures across the 
country. 
"Senator Bayh provides a rare and timely perspective for our clients," said
Richard Cullen, McGuireWoods’ chairman. "Throughout his long and distinguished 
career in public service he was known for working with Democrats and 
Republicans, not to score political points, but rather to drive consensus around 
issues that mattered most. He will help us and our clients understand how to get 
things done in an environment rife with partisan perils but aching for sensible, 
common ground solutions." 
McGuireWoods is one of the nation’s largest and most diverse law firms, with 
over 900 lawyers serving corporate and institutional clients from 19 offices in 
the U. S. and Europe. Bayh will also be a senior advisor to McGuireWoods 
Consulting, the firm’s public affairs subsidiary, one of only a few in the 
nation with deep experience and solid bipartisan relationships not only in 
Washington but in state capitals around the country. 
“I am honored to join McGuireWoods,” said Bayh. “I’ve always been impressed 
by the top-notch professionalism, excellent character and collegial atmosphere 
here. The firm’s national and increasingly global presence gives me a broad 
platform to develop a challenging practice serving a wide variety of clients at 
the highest level.” 
In addition to his practice at McGuireWoods, Senator Bayh is a senior advisor 
at Apollo Global Management in New York, and will continue to speak on the 
pressing issues facing our nation and the world.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Ezra Klein  By Ezra Klein  March 15, 2011       After two terms in the Senate, Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) announced that he was done with Congress. "There are better ways to serve my fellow citizens," Bayh said. "I love working for the people of Indiana. I love helping our citizens make the most of their lives, but I do not love Congress." (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)  But he was a very interesting near-retiree. When he decided not to seek reelection in 2010, he published a precise and devastating broadside against the institution in which he and his father had served. Instead of merely condemning the bitter partisanship of the place, he proposed to close the loopholes that had enabled polarization to metastasize in paralysis. “Filibusters should require 35 senators to ... make a commitment to continually debate an issue in reality, not just in theory,” he wrote. And “the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster should be reduced to 55 from 60.” Strong stuff. He then went after money in politics, calling for “legislation to enhance disclosure requirements, require corporate donors to appear in the political ads they finance and prohibit government contractors or bailout beneficiaries from spending money on political campaigns,” not to mention “public matching funds for smaller contributions. Bayh had no record of leadership on any of these topics. But, in part for that reason, it was particularly potent to hear him speaking out on them. An acknowledged moderate who’d taken on these crusades wouldn’t have just been a good senator. He’d have been a great one. This new incarnation of Evan Bayh, I wrote, should stay in the Senate, where he could do some good. But he didn’t want to stay in the Senate, he told me in subsequent interviews. He waxed rhapsodic over his time teaching at Indiana University’s Graduate School of Business. “It was real, it was tangible, and it was making a difference every day,” he said. He wanted that feeling again. He wanted to come home at night, he told me, and say, “Dear, do you know what we got done today? I’ve got this really bright kid in my class, and do you know what he asked me, and here’s what I told him, and I think I saw a little epiphany moment go off in his mind.” For a United States senator to explain his retirement by saying, “I want to be engaged in an honorable line of work,” was the single most persuasive and devastating critique I’d ever seen of the Senate as an institution. But Bayh did not return to Indiana to teach. He did not, as he said he was thinking of doing, join a foundation. Rather, he went to the massive law firm McGuire Woods. And who does McGuire Woods work for? “Principal clients served from our Washington office include national energy companies, foreign countries, international manufacturing companies, trade associations and local and national businesses,” reads the company’s Web site. He followed that up by signing on as a senior adviser to Apollo Management Group, a giant public-equity firm. And, finally, this week, he joined Fox News as a contributor. It’s as if he’s systematically ticking off every poison he identified in the body politic and rushing to dump more of it into the water supply.   The “corrosive system of campaign financing” that Bayh considered such a threat? He’s being paid by both McGuire Woods and Apollo Global Management to act as a corroding agent on their behalf. The “strident partisanship” and “unyielding ideology” he complained was ruining the Senate? At Fox News, he’ll be right there on set while it gets cooked up. His warning that “what is required from members of Congress and the public alike is a new spirit of devotion to the national welfare beyond party or self-interest” sounds, in retrospect, like a joke. Evan Bayh doing performance art as Evan Bayh. Exactly which of these new positions would Bayh say is against his self-interest, or in promotion of the general welfare? I should say, for the record, that I got in touch with McGuire Woods to give Bayh an opportunity to comment, or offer an alternative interpretation of his career decisions. I didn’t hear from them, but I got a call back from a PR person at Fox News. “I’m going to decline the interview for Mr. Bayh,” the flack said. And I guess I’m not surprised: It’s one thing to take the positions Bayh took without much of a record on them. It’s a whole other to try to sustain them when his paychecks are being signed by people who profit from the very forces he lamented. In our last interview, Bayh complained of the poor opinion the public had of him and his colleagues. “They look at us like we’re worse than used-car salesmen.” Yes. They do. And this is why.          business   Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

Birch Evans Bayh III (/ˈbaɪ/ BY; born December 26, 1955) is an American lawyer and Democratic politician who served as the junior U.S. Senator from Indiana from 1999 to 2011. He earlier served as the 46th Governor of Indiana from 1989 to 1997.
Bayh first held public office as the Secretary of State of Indiana, elected in 1986. He held the position for only two years before being elected governor. He left his office after completing two terms and briefly took a job lecturing at Indiana University Bloomington, before being elected to the U.S. Senate seat once held by his father, Birch Bayh.[citation needed]
On February 15, 2010, Bayh unexpectedly announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate in 2010. After leaving the Senate, he was replaced by his predecessor, Dan Coats, and became a partner with the law and lobbying firm McGuireWoods in the firm's Washington, D.C., office,[1] and also became a senior adviser with Apollo Global Management. He was a part-time contributor for Fox News from March 2011 to July 2016.[2] In June 2011 he became a messaging adviser for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[3] On October 27, 2011, it was announced that Berry Plastics Corp. had appointed Bayh to its board of directors.[4] He serves on the board of directors of Marathon Petroleum, the 2011 spin-off from Marathon Oil.[citation needed]
Following the withdrawal of 2016 Democratic primary winner Baron Hill, Bayh announced that he would be running to take back his old Senate seat from retiring Republican incumbent Dan Coats.[5] He was defeated by Todd Young in the general election by a 10-point margin (Young 52% vs. Bayh 42%).[6]

Personal life[edit]




Evan with his father Birch and mother Marvella during his father's 1962 senate campaign


Bayh was born in Shirkieville, Indiana, the son of Marvella Bayh (née Hern) and Birch Evans Bayh Jr., who was a U.S. Senator from 1963 until his 1981 defeat by then-Representative and future Vice President Dan Quayle.
Evan Bayh attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and graduated with honors with a B.S. in business administration from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington in 1978. At Indiana, he became a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity's Indiana Beta chapter. Bayh has an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Golden Gate University School of Law in California.[citation needed]
Bayh received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981, and clerked for a federal judge before entering private law practice in Indianapolis.[citation needed]
Bayh and his wife, Susan, have twin sons, born in 1995.[7] Susan Bayh serves on numerous corporate boards, including health insurance giant Anthem.[8] She was also, for many years, a law professor.[9]
Indiana state politics[edit]




As governor, Bayh implemented a $1.6 billion tax cut, the largest in state history, before Governor Mike Pence implemented one larger in 2013


After a debate over whether he met the state's five-year residency requirement to be on the ballot,[10] Bayh was elected Secretary of State of Indiana in 1986 and served from 1987-89.[citation needed]
Bayh was first elected Governor of Indiana in 1988, defeating former Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily in the Democratic primary. Bayh was the first Democrat to serve as Governor of Indiana in 20 years. Bayh defeated Republican John Mutz in the general election. He was re-elected governor in 1992 with 63% of the vote.[11] He defeated State Attorney General Linley E. Pearson, a Republican, to win his second term. By the end of his second term, Bayh had an approval rating of nearly 80 percent.[10]
Bayh was a vocal supporter of capital punishment.[12]
When his second term as governor ended in 1997, he accepted a lecturing position at his alma mater, the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington.[10] From 1997 to 1998, while he was campaigning for U.S. Senate, Bayh was also hired as a partner at Indianapolis law firm Baker & Daniels. In 1998, his Baker & Daniels salary was $265,000, according to Senate financial records. Indiana University paid him an additional $51,000 that year.[13]
United States Senator from Indiana[edit]


2004 campaign logo


Bayh was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998 to the seat that was once held by his father. He won with 64% of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a Democrat in a U.S. Senate race in Indiana, defeating former Fort Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke. Bayh carried all but four counties, including several that usually tilt Republican.[citation needed]
He easily won reelection in 2004, defeating Prof. Marvin Scott, receiving 62% of the vote—in the process, becoming only the fifth Indiana Democrat to be popularly elected to a second term in the Senate, and the first since his father.[citation needed]
During his Senate career, Bayh served on five Senate committees: Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, of which he was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance; Armed Services; the Select Committee on Intelligence; the Special Committee on Aging; and the Small Business Committee.[citation needed]
Bayh released an autobiography in 2003 entitled From Father to Son: A Private Life in the Public Eye. He describes growing up as the son of Senator Birch Bayh and emphasizes the importance of active, responsible fatherhood.[citation needed]
From 2001 to 2005, Bayh served as Chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). He is also a member of the Senate Centrist Coalition, helped establish the New Democrat Coalition, and founded the Moderate Dems Working Group.[14] Bayh also served on the Board of Directors of the National Endowment for Democracy.[15]
Bayh voted against confirming United States Attorney General John Ashcroft, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.[citation needed]
Bayh was an early supporter of the Bush administration's policies on Iraq.[16][17][18]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and Congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] He voted yes on reauthorizing the Patriot Act in 2006.[20]




Bayh speaking with Barack Obama on Air Force One in 2009


In the aftermath of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, Bayh joined with his fellow senators in hurrying to bail out U.S. financial institutions. Addressing the launch of the No Labels political organization, he "described a scene from 2008 where Ben Bernanke warned senators that the sky would collapse if the banks weren't rescued. 'We looked at each other,' said Bayh, 'and said, okay, what do we need.'"[21]
Retirement[edit]
See also: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2010
On February 15, 2010, Bayh announced he would not seek reelection to a third Senate term in the November 2, 2010 midterm election. Bayh's announcement came very shortly after former Senator Dan Coats declared his own candidacy for Bayh's Senate seat.[22] Because he made his announcement the day before the deadline for filing for the primary, no Democrat was able to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, so the state party committee chose Congressman Brad Ellsworth as the nominee.[23][24]
According to the Associated Press, Bayh spent a significant portion of his last year in office searching for a job, holding over four dozen meetings with potential corporate employers between February and December 2010.[25] He also cast votes on issues of interest to his future corporate employers.[25]
A CNN analysis of Bayh's internal 2009 schedule found that he "maneuvered behind the scenes" and "privately engaged with fundraisers, lobbyists and donors who had a keen interest on the issues dominating Capitol Hill," raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns. His meetings included sessions with lobbyists for the health insurance industry prior to his announcement that he would support the Affordable Care Act.[26]

Relationship between his Senate office and wife's corporate career[edit]
Susan Bayh, Evan Bayh's wife, has been described by the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette as a "professional board member" or "professional director", having been a director of fourteen corporations since 1994 and being a director of eight as of 2006.[27]
The Journal Gazette reported that since Susan Bayh began her career as a corporate director, “Sen. Evan Bayh [has] cast more than 3,000 votes, including some on issues of keen interest to the pharmaceutical, broadcast, insurance, food-distribution and finance industries".[27]
Since 2003, Bayh prohibited his staff from having lobbying contacts with his wife or representatives of the companies she directs. Bayh has insisted his wife’s ties have had no bearing on his congressional actions. “The reality is I don’t even know the people who run the vast majority of her companies. I’ve never even spoken to them,” Bayh told the Journal Gazette. “The reality is, we don’t talk about stuff that she’s involved with.”[27]
2008 U.S. presidential election[edit]

Bayh speaks during the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado


On December 1, 2006, news sources revealed that Bayh was creating a presidential exploratory committee.[28] Bayh confirmed these reports on December 3.[29] On December 15, 2006, Bayh announced that he would not run for president in 2008. He later endorsed Hillary Clinton.[30]
During the 2008 United States Presidential campaign, Bayh stated that he would accept an offer to be Barack Obama's running mate.[31] According to David Plouffe, it was a "coin toss" between Bayh and Joe Biden for Obama's pick for vice president, with Tim Kaine being a contender before deciding to focus on the DNC chairmanship.[32]
Post Senate career[edit]




Bayh speaking at an event during the 2012 Democratic National Convention


After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, it was announced that Bayh would work as a strategic adviser on policy for the corporate law firm McGuireWoods LLP and as a senior adviser to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.[citation needed]
Bayh campaigned for Senator Joe Donnelly's two-day, five-city "main street tour," among other visits, and introduced Donnelly before his victory speech in Indiana's 2012 U.S. Senate election.[33][34][35]
As of the end of 2015, Bayh had just over $9 million in unspent campaign cash.[36][37]

Bayh's net worth soared to between $13.9 million and $48 million after he left office and began a post-Congress career with lobbying firms and corporate boards.[38] This was a significant increase over the $6.8-$8.0 million in assets he reported during his last year in Congress.[39] Bayh received over $6 million in compensation from salary, compensation from corporate boards, and speaking fees from January 2015 through October 2016.[38]
2016 U.S. Senate campaign[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2016
On July 11, 2016, CNN reported that Bayh was preparing to enter the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana to run for the seat being vacated by Dan Coats, who was retiring. Baron Hill, who won an uncontested primary to become the Democratic nominee on May 3, formally withdrew from the race on the same day to make way for Bayh's candidacy.[40][41]
Bayh ran into criticism in August 2016 over his residency status in Indiana. WFLI-TV reported that he was listed twice as an "inactive voter" in Indiana records.[42] CNN reported that Bayh repeatedly listed his two multimillion-dollar houses in Washington, D.C. as his primary residences, not his $53,000 condo in Indianapolis.[43] When asked by a local television reporter to state his Indiana address, he stated the wrong address.[44][45] In response, Bayh stated that he "voted in every primary and every general election for the last 25 to 30 years" and is "an active voter in Indiana," and when asked how often he is in Indiana, he stated, "all the time, frequently."[42]
Bayh was defeated by Republican Representative Todd Young in the November election.[6] Young won 52% of the vote to Bayh's 42%.[46][47]
Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Evan Bayh has a 100% rating by the NARAL.[48] He voted in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. He voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in 2004. He voted in favor of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2006.[49] He voted against an amendment to prohibit federal funds from going to groups that support coerced abortion. He repeatedly voted against amendments to prohibit federal funds from being used for abortions.[49]
Agriculture[edit]
Bayh voted for the 2002 Farm Bill that provided financial support accessible to rural communities. The bill provides funds for rural water and waste infrastructure. The Farm Bill also provides technology for rural residents' technical skills.[50]
Civil rights[edit]
Bayh has a mixed but left-leaning record on civil rights, having earned a 60% by the ACLU (2002), and 89% by the HRC (2006), and a 100% by the NAACP (2006). Some of his votes include a 1998 vote where Bayh voted to continue nonquota affirmative action programs. He voted to add sexual orientation under hate crime rules in both 2000 and 2002. In 2001, he voted yes to ease wiretapping restrictions. In 2006, he voted yes on a flag-burning constitutional amendment and no on an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[51]
Climate change[edit]
Bayh has been called "a fence-sitter on climate legislation," because he has stated concern about the effects of climate change but he also values cheap energy as beneficial to Indiana's manufacturing industry.[52] In 2008 he signed a letter expressing concerns with a cap-and-trade bill known as the Climate Security Act that was then on the Senate floor,[53] but he ultimately voted for the bill.[54] In 2010 he voted to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas pollution.[55]
Economy[edit]
At a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Bayh said:

What concerns me most about President Bush's tax and budget proposals, is that they threaten to undermine the foundation of the '90s' prosperity – replacing the "virtuous cycle" created by fiscal responsibility with a "vicious cycle" of deficits and debt, rising interest rates, and disinvestment. His proposals constitute a narrow ideological agenda, not an effective economic strategy, and completely fail to grasp the realities of the New Economy and the many requirements for economic success in the 21st Century.[56]

Education[edit]
As governor, Bayh created the 21st Century Scholars program, which promises at-risk middle school students full tuition scholarships in return for being drug, alcohol and crime-free and maintaining decent grades. Iowa and Wisconsin have both introduced legislation modeling Bayh's program.[57][58]
Energy[edit]
On September 11, 2008, Bayh joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan group designed to promote comprehensive energy reform.[59][better source needed]
Environment[edit]

Voted no on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land in December 2007.[51]
Voted yes on including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations in September 2005.[51]
Rated 74% by the League of Conservation Voters, indicating pro-environment votes, in December 2003.[51]
Voted no on confirming Gale Norton as Secretary of Interior in January 2001.[51]
Voted no on more funding for forest roads and fish habitat in September 1999.[51]
Voted to strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting in January 2007.[51]
Voted to restrict the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in June 2010).[citation needed]

Health care[edit]
Bayh introduced the Medicare Prescription Drug Emergency Guarantee Act of 2006 to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to assure uninterrupted access to necessary medicines under the Medicare prescription drug program.[60] Bayh proposed legislation he says could help cut health care insurance premiums by at least 20 percent for small businesses and individuals.[61] He voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (both 2010).[62][63]
Israel[edit]
Speaking to 2002 luncheon hosted by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, Bayh "described his lifelong affection for the state of Israel, beginning with a boyhood vacation there, and deepening with his many official visits as a governor and senator."[64][better source needed] He is also a member of AIPAC's advisory committee.[65]
Iran[edit]
Bayh appeared on CNN's Late Edition in January 2006[66] and referred to the "radical, almost delusional nature of the Iranian regime" and recent comments of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Holocaust is a "myth. [...] To deny history like this, this virulent anti-Semitism, their sponsoring of terrorism, their search for a nuclear weapon – ought to be a wake-up call to every American. Appeasement won't work. [...] We need to use diplomacy, economic sanctions, other means, so we won't have to resort to military action."[66]
Bayh introduced legislation in January 2006 that would impose sanctions on Iran.[67]
On January 20, 2006, Bayh introduced a resolution calling for economic sanctions on Iran, with the goal of deterring Iran from developing nuclear weapons.[68] In 2007, Bayh "supported the Kyl-Lieberman amendment that Obama made a key part of his critique of Clinton."[69][70]
Iraq[edit]




Bayh shakes the hand of a marine while visiting Iraq in January 2006


Bayh was an early supporter of the idea of removing Saddam Hussein from power for humanitarian reasons.[16]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] In 2006, Bayh criticized the conduct of the Iraq War:

It is clear to just about everyone but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history. And while we have been preoccupied with Iraq, under this President, North Korea has gone nuclear and Iran is on the verge of doing so.[71]

A blog from The Washington Post reported that in February 2006 Bayh was quoted saying: "We've got to be somewhere between 'cut and run' ... and mindlessly staying the course. You've got to have a sensible middle ground."[72]
Trade[edit]
During his time in the Senate, Bayh criticized trade policies of some countries, including China. Bayh's bipartisan Stopping Overseas Subsidies (SOS) Act was intended to allow the United States to enforce its antisubsidy laws abroad. He voted against CAFTA.[73]
Bayh placed a hold on the President's nominee to be the U.S. Trade Representative. After receiving several key commitments from nominee (now U.S. Senator) Rob Portman to get tough on China trade, Bayh agreed to release his hold.[74]

Birch Evans Bayh III (/ˈbaɪ/ BY; born December 26, 1955) is an American lawyer and Democratic politician who served as the junior U.S. Senator from Indiana from 1999 to 2011. He earlier served as the 46th Governor of Indiana from 1989 to 1997.
Bayh first held public office as the Secretary of State of Indiana, elected in 1986. He held the position for only two years before being elected governor. He left his office after completing two terms and briefly took a job lecturing at Indiana University Bloomington, before being elected to the U.S. Senate seat once held by his father, Birch Bayh.[citation needed]
On February 15, 2010, Bayh unexpectedly announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate in 2010. After leaving the Senate, he was replaced by his predecessor, Dan Coats, and became a partner with the law and lobbying firm McGuireWoods in the firm's Washington, D.C., office,[1] and also became a senior adviser with Apollo Global Management. He was a part-time contributor for Fox News from March 2011 to July 2016.[2] In June 2011 he became a messaging adviser for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[3] On October 27, 2011, it was announced that Berry Plastics Corp. had appointed Bayh to its board of directors.[4] He serves on the board of directors of Marathon Petroleum, the 2011 spin-off from Marathon Oil.[citation needed]
Following the withdrawal of 2016 Democratic primary winner Baron Hill, Bayh announced that he would be running to take back his old Senate seat from retiring Republican incumbent Dan Coats.[5] He was defeated by Todd Young in the general election by a 10-point margin (Young 52% vs. Bayh 42%).[6]

Personal life[edit]




Evan with his father Birch and mother Marvella during his father's 1962 senate campaign


Bayh was born in Shirkieville, Indiana, the son of Marvella Bayh (née Hern) and Birch Evans Bayh Jr., who was a U.S. Senator from 1963 until his 1981 defeat by then-Representative and future Vice President Dan Quayle.
Evan Bayh attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and graduated with honors with a B.S. in business administration from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington in 1978. At Indiana, he became a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity's Indiana Beta chapter. Bayh has an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Golden Gate University School of Law in California.[citation needed]
Bayh received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981, and clerked for a federal judge before entering private law practice in Indianapolis.[citation needed]
Bayh and his wife, Susan, have twin sons, born in 1995.[7] Susan Bayh serves on numerous corporate boards, including health insurance giant Anthem.[8] She was also, for many years, a law professor.[9]
Indiana state politics[edit]




As governor, Bayh implemented a $1.6 billion tax cut, the largest in state history, before Governor Mike Pence implemented one larger in 2013


After a debate over whether he met the state's five-year residency requirement to be on the ballot,[10] Bayh was elected Secretary of State of Indiana in 1986 and served from 1987-89.[citation needed]
Bayh was first elected Governor of Indiana in 1988, defeating former Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily in the Democratic primary. Bayh was the first Democrat to serve as Governor of Indiana in 20 years. Bayh defeated Republican John Mutz in the general election. He was re-elected governor in 1992 with 63% of the vote.[11] He defeated State Attorney General Linley E. Pearson, a Republican, to win his second term. By the end of his second term, Bayh had an approval rating of nearly 80 percent.[10]
Bayh was a vocal supporter of capital punishment.[12]
When his second term as governor ended in 1997, he accepted a lecturing position at his alma mater, the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington.[10] From 1997 to 1998, while he was campaigning for U.S. Senate, Bayh was also hired as a partner at Indianapolis law firm Baker & Daniels. In 1998, his Baker & Daniels salary was $265,000, according to Senate financial records. Indiana University paid him an additional $51,000 that year.[13]
United States Senator from Indiana[edit]


2004 campaign logo


Bayh was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998 to the seat that was once held by his father. He won with 64% of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a Democrat in a U.S. Senate race in Indiana, defeating former Fort Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke. Bayh carried all but four counties, including several that usually tilt Republican.[citation needed]
He easily won reelection in 2004, defeating Prof. Marvin Scott, receiving 62% of the vote—in the process, becoming only the fifth Indiana Democrat to be popularly elected to a second term in the Senate, and the first since his father.[citation needed]
During his Senate career, Bayh served on five Senate committees: Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, of which he was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance; Armed Services; the Select Committee on Intelligence; the Special Committee on Aging; and the Small Business Committee.[citation needed]
Bayh released an autobiography in 2003 entitled From Father to Son: A Private Life in the Public Eye. He describes growing up as the son of Senator Birch Bayh and emphasizes the importance of active, responsible fatherhood.[citation needed]
From 2001 to 2005, Bayh served as Chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). He is also a member of the Senate Centrist Coalition, helped establish the New Democrat Coalition, and founded the Moderate Dems Working Group.[14] Bayh also served on the Board of Directors of the National Endowment for Democracy.[15]
Bayh voted against confirming United States Attorney General John Ashcroft, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.[citation needed]
Bayh was an early supporter of the Bush administration's policies on Iraq.[16][17][18]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and Congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] He voted yes on reauthorizing the Patriot Act in 2006.[20]




Bayh speaking with Barack Obama on Air Force One in 2009


In the aftermath of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, Bayh joined with his fellow senators in hurrying to bail out U.S. financial institutions. Addressing the launch of the No Labels political organization, he "described a scene from 2008 where Ben Bernanke warned senators that the sky would collapse if the banks weren't rescued. 'We looked at each other,' said Bayh, 'and said, okay, what do we need.'"[21]
Retirement[edit]
See also: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2010
On February 15, 2010, Bayh announced he would not seek reelection to a third Senate term in the November 2, 2010 midterm election. Bayh's announcement came very shortly after former Senator Dan Coats declared his own candidacy for Bayh's Senate seat.[22] Because he made his announcement the day before the deadline for filing for the primary, no Democrat was able to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, so the state party committee chose Congressman Brad Ellsworth as the nominee.[23][24]
According to the Associated Press, Bayh spent a significant portion of his last year in office searching for a job, holding over four dozen meetings with potential corporate employers between February and December 2010.[25] He also cast votes on issues of interest to his future corporate employers.[25]
A CNN analysis of Bayh's internal 2009 schedule found that he "maneuvered behind the scenes" and "privately engaged with fundraisers, lobbyists and donors who had a keen interest on the issues dominating Capitol Hill," raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns. His meetings included sessions with lobbyists for the health insurance industry prior to his announcement that he would support the Affordable Care Act.[26]

Relationship between his Senate office and wife's corporate career[edit]
Susan Bayh, Evan Bayh's wife, has been described by the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette as a "professional board member" or "professional director", having been a director of fourteen corporations since 1994 and being a director of eight as of 2006.[27]
The Journal Gazette reported that since Susan Bayh began her career as a corporate director, “Sen. Evan Bayh [has] cast more than 3,000 votes, including some on issues of keen interest to the pharmaceutical, broadcast, insurance, food-distribution and finance industries".[27]
Since 2003, Bayh prohibited his staff from having lobbying contacts with his wife or representatives of the companies she directs. Bayh has insisted his wife’s ties have had no bearing on his congressional actions. “The reality is I don’t even know the people who run the vast majority of her companies. I’ve never even spoken to them,” Bayh told the Journal Gazette. “The reality is, we don’t talk about stuff that she’s involved with.”[27]
2008 U.S. presidential election[edit]

Further information: Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008 and Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 2008




Bayh speaks during the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado


On December 1, 2006, news sources revealed that Bayh was creating a presidential exploratory committee.[28] Bayh confirmed these reports on December 3.[29] On December 15, 2006, Bayh announced that he would not run for president in 2008. He later endorsed Hillary Clinton.[30]
During the 2008 United States Presidential campaign, Bayh stated that he would accept an offer to be Barack Obama's running mate.[31] According to David Plouffe, it was a "coin toss" between Bayh and Joe Biden for Obama's pick for vice president, with Tim Kaine being a contender before deciding to focus on the DNC chairmanship.[32]
Post Senate career[edit]




Bayh speaking at an event during the 2012 Democratic National Convention


After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, it was announced that Bayh would work as a strategic adviser on policy for the corporate law firm McGuireWoods LLP and as a senior adviser to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.[citation needed]
Bayh campaigned for Senator Joe Donnelly's two-day, five-city "main street tour," among other visits, and introduced Donnelly before his victory speech in Indiana's 2012 U.S. Senate election.[33][34][35]
As of the end of 2015, Bayh had just over $9 million in unspent campaign cash.[36][37]




Bayh with Haley Barbour in 2013



Bayh's net worth soared to between $13.9 million and $48 million after he left office and began a post-Congress career with lobbying firms and corporate boards.[38] This was a significant increase over the $6.8-$8.0 million in assets he reported during his last year in Congress.[39] Bayh received over $6 million in compensation from salary, compensation from corporate boards, and speaking fees from January 2015 through October 2016.[38]
2016 U.S. Senate campaign[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2016
On July 11, 2016, CNN reported that Bayh was preparing to enter the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana to run for the seat being vacated by Dan Coats, who was retiring. Baron Hill, who won an uncontested primary to become the Democratic nominee on May 3, formally withdrew from the race on the same day to make way for Bayh's candidacy.[40][41]
Bayh ran into criticism in August 2016 over his residency status in Indiana. WFLI-TV reported that he was listed twice as an "inactive voter" in Indiana records.[42] CNN reported that Bayh repeatedly listed his two multimillion-dollar houses in Washington, D.C. as his primary residences, not his $53,000 condo in Indianapolis.[43] When asked by a local television reporter to state his Indiana address, he stated the wrong address.[44][45] In response, Bayh stated that he "voted in every primary and every general election for the last 25 to 30 years" and is "an active voter in Indiana," and when asked how often he is in Indiana, he stated, "all the time, frequently."[42]
Bayh was defeated by Republican Representative Todd Young in the November election.[6] Young won 52% of the vote to Bayh's 42%.[46][47]
Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Evan Bayh has a 100% rating by the NARAL.[48] He voted in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. He voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in 2004. He voted in favor of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2006.[49] He voted against an amendment to prohibit federal funds from going to groups that support coerced abortion. He repeatedly voted against amendments to prohibit federal funds from being used for abortions.[49]
Agriculture[edit]
Bayh voted for the 2002 Farm Bill that provided financial support accessible to rural communities. The bill provides funds for rural water and waste infrastructure. The Farm Bill also provides technology for rural residents' technical skills.[50]
Civil rights[edit]
Bayh has a mixed but left-leaning record on civil rights, having earned a 60% by the ACLU (2002), and 89% by the HRC (2006), and a 100% by the NAACP (2006). Some of his votes include a 1998 vote where Bayh voted to continue nonquota affirmative action programs. He voted to add sexual orientation under hate crime rules in both 2000 and 2002. In 2001, he voted yes to ease wiretapping restrictions. In 2006, he voted yes on a flag-burning constitutional amendment and no on an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[51]
Climate change[edit]
Bayh has been called "a fence-sitter on climate legislation," because he has stated concern about the effects of climate change but he also values cheap energy as beneficial to Indiana's manufacturing industry.[52] In 2008 he signed a letter expressing concerns with a cap-and-trade bill known as the Climate Security Act that was then on the Senate floor,[53] but he ultimately voted for the bill.[54] In 2010 he voted to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas pollution.[55]
Economy[edit]
At a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Bayh said:

What concerns me most about President Bush's tax and budget proposals, is that they threaten to undermine the foundation of the '90s' prosperity – replacing the "virtuous cycle" created by fiscal responsibility with a "vicious cycle" of deficits and debt, rising interest rates, and disinvestment. His proposals constitute a narrow ideological agenda, not an effective economic strategy, and completely fail to grasp the realities of the New Economy and the many requirements for economic success in the 21st Century.[56]

Education[edit]
As governor, Bayh created the 21st Century Scholars program, which promises at-risk middle school students full tuition scholarships in return for being drug, alcohol and crime-free and maintaining decent grades. Iowa and Wisconsin have both introduced legislation modeling Bayh's program.[57][58]
Energy[edit]
On September 11, 2008, Bayh joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan group designed to promote comprehensive energy reform.[59][better source needed]
Environment[edit]

Voted no on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land in December 2007.[51]
Voted yes on including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations in September 2005.[51]
Rated 74% by the League of Conservation Voters, indicating pro-environment votes, in December 2003.[51]
Voted no on confirming Gale Norton as Secretary of Interior in January 2001.[51]
Voted no on more funding for forest roads and fish habitat in September 1999.[51]
Voted to strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting in January 2007.[51]
Voted to restrict the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in June 2010).[citation needed]

Health care[edit]
Bayh introduced the Medicare Prescription Drug Emergency Guarantee Act of 2006 to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to assure uninterrupted access to necessary medicines under the Medicare prescription drug program.[60] Bayh proposed legislation he says could help cut health care insurance premiums by at least 20 percent for small businesses and individuals.[61] He voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (both 2010).[62][63]
Israel[edit]
Speaking to 2002 luncheon hosted by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, Bayh "described his lifelong affection for the state of Israel, beginning with a boyhood vacation there, and deepening with his many official visits as a governor and senator."[64][better source needed] He is also a member of AIPAC's advisory committee.[65]
Iran[edit]
Bayh appeared on CNN's Late Edition in January 2006[66] and referred to the "radical, almost delusional nature of the Iranian regime" and recent comments of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Holocaust is a "myth. [...] To deny history like this, this virulent anti-Semitism, their sponsoring of terrorism, their search for a nuclear weapon – ought to be a wake-up call to every American. Appeasement won't work. [...] We need to use diplomacy, economic sanctions, other means, so we won't have to resort to military action."[66]
Bayh introduced legislation in January 2006 that would impose sanctions on Iran.[67]
On January 20, 2006, Bayh introduced a resolution calling for economic sanctions on Iran, with the goal of deterring Iran from developing nuclear weapons.[68] In 2007, Bayh "supported the Kyl-Lieberman amendment that Obama made a key part of his critique of Clinton."[69][70]
Iraq[edit]




Bayh shakes the hand of a marine while visiting Iraq in January 2006


Bayh was an early supporter of the idea of removing Saddam Hussein from power for humanitarian reasons.[16]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] In 2006, Bayh criticized the conduct of the Iraq War:

It is clear to just about everyone but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history. And while we have been preoccupied with Iraq, under this President, North Korea has gone nuclear and Iran is on the verge of doing so.[71]

A blog from The Washington Post reported that in February 2006 Bayh was quoted saying: "We've got to be somewhere between 'cut and run' ... and mindlessly staying the course. You've got to have a sensible middle ground."[72]
Trade[edit]
During his time in the Senate, Bayh criticized trade policies of some countries, including China. Bayh's bipartisan Stopping Overseas Subsidies (SOS) Act was intended to allow the United States to enforce its antisubsidy laws abroad. He voted against CAFTA.[73]
Bayh placed a hold on the President's nominee to be the U.S. Trade Representative. After receiving several key commitments from nominee (now U.S. Senator) Rob Portman to get tough on China trade, Bayh agreed to release his hold.[74]

Birch Evans Bayh III (/ˈbaɪ/ BY; born December 26, 1955) is an American lawyer and Democratic politician who served as the junior U.S. Senator from Indiana from 1999 to 2011. He earlier served as the 46th Governor of Indiana from 1989 to 1997.
Bayh first held public office as the Secretary of State of Indiana, elected in 1986. He held the position for only two years before being elected governor. He left his office after completing two terms and briefly took a job lecturing at Indiana University Bloomington, before being elected to the U.S. Senate seat once held by his father, Birch Bayh.[citation needed]
On February 15, 2010, Bayh unexpectedly announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate in 2010. After leaving the Senate, he was replaced by his predecessor, Dan Coats, and became a partner with the law and lobbying firm McGuireWoods in the firm's Washington, D.C., office,[1] and also became a senior adviser with Apollo Global Management. He was a part-time contributor for Fox News from March 2011 to July 2016.[2] In June 2011 he became a messaging adviser for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[3] On October 27, 2011, it was announced that Berry Plastics Corp. had appointed Bayh to its board of directors.[4] He serves on the board of directors of Marathon Petroleum, the 2011 spin-off from Marathon Oil.[citation needed]
Following the withdrawal of 2016 Democratic primary winner Baron Hill, Bayh announced that he would be running to take back his old Senate seat from retiring Republican incumbent Dan Coats.[5] He was defeated by Todd Young in the general election by a 10-point margin (Young 52% vs. Bayh 42%).[6]

Personal life[edit]




Evan with his father Birch and mother Marvella during his father's 1962 senate campaign


Bayh was born in Shirkieville, Indiana, the son of Marvella Bayh (née Hern) and Birch Evans Bayh Jr., who was a U.S. Senator from 1963 until his 1981 defeat by then-Representative and future Vice President Dan Quayle.
Evan Bayh attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and graduated with honors with a B.S. in business administration from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington in 1978. At Indiana, he became a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity's Indiana Beta chapter. Bayh has an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Golden Gate University School of Law in California.[citation needed]
Bayh received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981, and clerked for a federal judge before entering private law practice in Indianapolis.[citation needed]
Bayh and his wife, Susan, have twin sons, born in 1995.[7] Susan Bayh serves on numerous corporate boards, including health insurance giant Anthem.[8] She was also, for many years, a law professor.[9]
Indiana state politics[edit]




As governor, Bayh implemented a $1.6 billion tax cut, the largest in state history, before Governor Mike Pence implemented one larger in 2013


After a debate over whether he met the state's five-year residency requirement to be on the ballot,[10] Bayh was elected Secretary of State of Indiana in 1986 and served from 1987-89.[citation needed]
Bayh was first elected Governor of Indiana in 1988, defeating former Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily in the Democratic primary. Bayh was the first Democrat to serve as Governor of Indiana in 20 years. Bayh defeated Republican John Mutz in the general election. He was re-elected governor in 1992 with 63% of the vote.[11] He defeated State Attorney General Linley E. Pearson, a Republican, to win his second term. By the end of his second term, Bayh had an approval rating of nearly 80 percent.[10]
Bayh was a vocal supporter of capital punishment.[12]
When his second term as governor ended in 1997, he accepted a lecturing position at his alma mater, the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington.[10] From 1997 to 1998, while he was campaigning for U.S. Senate, Bayh was also hired as a partner at Indianapolis law firm Baker & Daniels. In 1998, his Baker & Daniels salary was $265,000, according to Senate financial records. Indiana University paid him an additional $51,000 that year.[13]
United States Senator from Indiana[edit]


2004 campaign logo


Bayh was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998 to the seat that was once held by his father. He won with 64% of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a Democrat in a U.S. Senate race in Indiana, defeating former Fort Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke. Bayh carried all but four counties, including several that usually tilt Republican.[citation needed]
He easily won reelection in 2004, defeating Prof. Marvin Scott, receiving 62% of the vote—in the process, becoming only the fifth Indiana Democrat to be popularly elected to a second term in the Senate, and the first since his father.[citation needed]
During his Senate career, Bayh served on five Senate committees: Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, of which he was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance; Armed Services; the Select Committee on Intelligence; the Special Committee on Aging; and the Small Business Committee.[citation needed]
Bayh released an autobiography in 2003 entitled From Father to Son: A Private Life in the Public Eye. He describes growing up as the son of Senator Birch Bayh and emphasizes the importance of active, responsible fatherhood.[citation needed]
From 2001 to 2005, Bayh served as Chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). He is also a member of the Senate Centrist Coalition, helped establish the New Democrat Coalition, and founded the Moderate Dems Working Group.[14] Bayh also served on the Board of Directors of the National Endowment for Democracy.[15]
Bayh voted against confirming United States Attorney General John Ashcroft, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.[citation needed]
Bayh was an early supporter of the Bush administration's policies on Iraq.[16][17][18]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and Congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] He voted yes on reauthorizing the Patriot Act in 2006.[20]




Bayh speaking with Barack Obama on Air Force One in 2009


In the aftermath of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, Bayh joined with his fellow senators in hurrying to bail out U.S. financial institutions. Addressing the launch of the No Labels political organization, he "described a scene from 2008 where Ben Bernanke warned senators that the sky would collapse if the banks weren't rescued. 'We looked at each other,' said Bayh, 'and said, okay, what do we need.'"[21]
Retirement[edit]
See also: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2010
On February 15, 2010, Bayh announced he would not seek reelection to a third Senate term in the November 2, 2010 midterm election. Bayh's announcement came very shortly after former Senator Dan Coats declared his own candidacy for Bayh's Senate seat.[22] Because he made his announcement the day before the deadline for filing for the primary, no Democrat was able to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, so the state party committee chose Congressman Brad Ellsworth as the nominee.[23][24]
According to the Associated Press, Bayh spent a significant portion of his last year in office searching for a job, holding over four dozen meetings with potential corporate employers between February and December 2010.[25] He also cast votes on issues of interest to his future corporate employers.[25]
A CNN analysis of Bayh's internal 2009 schedule found that he "maneuvered behind the scenes" and "privately engaged with fundraisers, lobbyists and donors who had a keen interest on the issues dominating Capitol Hill," raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns. His meetings included sessions with lobbyists for the health insurance industry prior to his announcement that he would support the Affordable Care Act.[26]

Relationship between his Senate office and wife's corporate career[edit]
Susan Bayh, Evan Bayh's wife, has been described by the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette as a "professional board member" or "professional director", having been a director of fourteen corporations since 1994 and being a director of eight as of 2006.[27]
The Journal Gazette reported that since Susan Bayh began her career as a corporate director, “Sen. Evan Bayh [has] cast more than 3,000 votes, including some on issues of keen interest to the pharmaceutical, broadcast, insurance, food-distribution and finance industries".[27]
Since 2003, Bayh prohibited his staff from having lobbying contacts with his wife or representatives of the companies she directs. Bayh has insisted his wife’s ties have had no bearing on his congressional actions. “The reality is I don’t even know the people who run the vast majority of her companies. I’ve never even spoken to them,” Bayh told the Journal Gazette. “The reality is, we don’t talk about stuff that she’s involved with.”[27]
2008 U.S. presidential election[edit]

Further information: Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008 and Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 2008




Bayh speaks during the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado


On December 1, 2006, news sources revealed that Bayh was creating a presidential exploratory committee.[28] Bayh confirmed these reports on December 3.[29] On December 15, 2006, Bayh announced that he would not run for president in 2008. He later endorsed Hillary Clinton.[30]
During the 2008 United States Presidential campaign, Bayh stated that he would accept an offer to be Barack Obama's running mate.[31] According to David Plouffe, it was a "coin toss" between Bayh and Joe Biden for Obama's pick for vice president, with Tim Kaine being a contender before deciding to focus on the DNC chairmanship.[32]
Post Senate career[edit]




Bayh speaking at an event during the 2012 Democratic National Convention


After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, it was announced that Bayh would work as a strategic adviser on policy for the corporate law firm McGuireWoods LLP and as a senior adviser to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.[citation needed]
Bayh campaigned for Senator Joe Donnelly's two-day, five-city "main street tour," among other visits, and introduced Donnelly before his victory speech in Indiana's 2012 U.S. Senate election.[33][34][35]
As of the end of 2015, Bayh had just over $9 million in unspent campaign cash.[36][37]




Bayh with Haley Barbour in 2013



Bayh's net worth soared to between $13.9 million and $48 million after he left office and began a post-Congress career with lobbying firms and corporate boards.[38] This was a significant increase over the $6.8-$8.0 million in assets he reported during his last year in Congress.[39] Bayh received over $6 million in compensation from salary, compensation from corporate boards, and speaking fees from January 2015 through October 2016.[38]
2016 U.S. Senate campaign[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2016
On July 11, 2016, CNN reported that Bayh was preparing to enter the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana to run for the seat being vacated by Dan Coats, who was retiring. Baron Hill, who won an uncontested primary to become the Democratic nominee on May 3, formally withdrew from the race on the same day to make way for Bayh's candidacy.[40][41]
Bayh ran into criticism in August 2016 over his residency status in Indiana. WFLI-TV reported that he was listed twice as an "inactive voter" in Indiana records.[42] CNN reported that Bayh repeatedly listed his two multimillion-dollar houses in Washington, D.C. as his primary residences, not his $53,000 condo in Indianapolis.[43] When asked by a local television reporter to state his Indiana address, he stated the wrong address.[44][45] In response, Bayh stated that he "voted in every primary and every general election for the last 25 to 30 years" and is "an active voter in Indiana," and when asked how often he is in Indiana, he stated, "all the time, frequently."[42]
Bayh was defeated by Republican Representative Todd Young in the November election.[6] Young won 52% of the vote to Bayh's 42%.[46][47]
Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Evan Bayh has a 100% rating by the NARAL.[48] He voted in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. He voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in 2004. He voted in favor of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2006.[49] He voted against an amendment to prohibit federal funds from going to groups that support coerced abortion. He repeatedly voted against amendments to prohibit federal funds from being used for abortions.[49]
Agriculture[edit]
Bayh voted for the 2002 Farm Bill that provided financial support accessible to rural communities. The bill provides funds for rural water and waste infrastructure. The Farm Bill also provides technology for rural residents' technical skills.[50]
Civil rights[edit]
Bayh has a mixed but left-leaning record on civil rights, having earned a 60% by the ACLU (2002), and 89% by the HRC (2006), and a 100% by the NAACP (2006). Some of his votes include a 1998 vote where Bayh voted to continue nonquota affirmative action programs. He voted to add sexual orientation under hate crime rules in both 2000 and 2002. In 2001, he voted yes to ease wiretapping restrictions. In 2006, he voted yes on a flag-burning constitutional amendment and no on an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[51]
Climate change[edit]
Bayh has been called "a fence-sitter on climate legislation," because he has stated concern about the effects of climate change but he also values cheap energy as beneficial to Indiana's manufacturing industry.[52] In 2008 he signed a letter expressing concerns with a cap-and-trade bill known as the Climate Security Act that was then on the Senate floor,[53] but he ultimately voted for the bill.[54] In 2010 he voted to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas pollution.[55]
Economy[edit]
At a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Bayh said:

What concerns me most about President Bush's tax and budget proposals, is that they threaten to undermine the foundation of the '90s' prosperity – replacing the "virtuous cycle" created by fiscal responsibility with a "vicious cycle" of deficits and debt, rising interest rates, and disinvestment. His proposals constitute a narrow ideological agenda, not an effective economic strategy, and completely fail to grasp the realities of the New Economy and the many requirements for economic success in the 21st Century.[56]

Education[edit]
As governor, Bayh created the 21st Century Scholars program, which promises at-risk middle school students full tuition scholarships in return for being drug, alcohol and crime-free and maintaining decent grades. Iowa and Wisconsin have both introduced legislation modeling Bayh's program.[57][58]
Energy[edit]
On September 11, 2008, Bayh joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan group designed to promote comprehensive energy reform.[59][better source needed]
Environment[edit]

Voted no on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land in December 2007.[51]
Voted yes on including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations in September 2005.[51]
Rated 74% by the League of Conservation Voters, indicating pro-environment votes, in December 2003.[51]
Voted no on confirming Gale Norton as Secretary of Interior in January 2001.[51]
Voted no on more funding for forest roads and fish habitat in September 1999.[51]
Voted to strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting in January 2007.[51]
Voted to restrict the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in June 2010).[citation needed]

Health care[edit]
Bayh introduced the Medicare Prescription Drug Emergency Guarantee Act of 2006 to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to assure uninterrupted access to necessary medicines under the Medicare prescription drug program.[60] Bayh proposed legislation he says could help cut health care insurance premiums by at least 20 percent for small businesses and individuals.[61] He voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (both 2010).[62][63]
Israel[edit]
Speaking to 2002 luncheon hosted by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, Bayh "described his lifelong affection for the state of Israel, beginning with a boyhood vacation there, and deepening with his many official visits as a governor and senator."[64][better source needed] He is also a member of AIPAC's advisory committee.[65]
Iran[edit]
Bayh appeared on CNN's Late Edition in January 2006[66] and referred to the "radical, almost delusional nature of the Iranian regime" and recent comments of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Holocaust is a "myth. [...] To deny history like this, this virulent anti-Semitism, their sponsoring of terrorism, their search for a nuclear weapon – ought to be a wake-up call to every American. Appeasement won't work. [...] We need to use diplomacy, economic sanctions, other means, so we won't have to resort to military action."[66]
Bayh introduced legislation in January 2006 that would impose sanctions on Iran.[67]
On January 20, 2006, Bayh introduced a resolution calling for economic sanctions on Iran, with the goal of deterring Iran from developing nuclear weapons.[68] In 2007, Bayh "supported the Kyl-Lieberman amendment that Obama made a key part of his critique of Clinton."[69][70]
Iraq[edit]

Bayh was an early supporter of the idea of removing Saddam Hussein from power for humanitarian reasons.[16]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] In 2006, Bayh criticized the conduct of the Iraq War:

It is clear to just about everyone but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history. And while we have been preoccupied with Iraq, under this President, North Korea has gone nuclear and Iran is on the verge of doing so.[71]

A blog from The Washington Post reported that in February 2006 Bayh was quoted saying: "We've got to be somewhere between 'cut and run' ... and mindlessly staying the course. You've got to have a sensible middle ground."[72]
Trade[edit]
During his time in the Senate, Bayh criticized trade policies of some countries, including China. Bayh's bipartisan Stopping Overseas Subsidies (SOS) Act was intended to allow the United States to enforce its antisubsidy laws abroad. He voted against CAFTA.[73]
Bayh placed a hold on the President's nominee to be the U.S. Trade Representative. After receiving several key commitments from nominee (now U.S. Senator) Rob Portman to get tough on China trade, Bayh agreed to release his hold.[74]

Birch Evans Bayh III (/ˈbaɪ/ BY; born December 26, 1955) is an American lawyer and Democratic politician who served as the junior U.S. Senator from Indiana from 1999 to 2011. He earlier served as the 46th Governor of Indiana from 1989 to 1997.
Bayh first held public office as the Secretary of State of Indiana, elected in 1986. He held the position for only two years before being elected governor. He left his office after completing two terms and briefly took a job lecturing at Indiana University Bloomington, before being elected to the U.S. Senate seat once held by his father, Birch Bayh.[citation needed]
On February 15, 2010, Bayh unexpectedly announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate in 2010. After leaving the Senate, he was replaced by his predecessor, Dan Coats, and became a partner with the law and lobbying firm McGuireWoods in the firm's Washington, D.C., office,[1] and also became a senior adviser with Apollo Global Management. He was a part-time contributor for Fox News from March 2011 to July 2016.[2] In June 2011 he became a messaging adviser for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[3] On October 27, 2011, it was announced that Berry Plastics Corp. had appointed Bayh to its board of directors.[4] He serves on the board of directors of Marathon Petroleum, the 2011 spin-off from Marathon Oil.[citation needed]
Following the withdrawal of 2016 Democratic primary winner Baron Hill, Bayh announced that he would be running to take back his old Senate seat from retiring Republican incumbent Dan Coats.[5] He was defeated by Todd Young in the general election by a 10-point margin (Young 52% vs. Bayh 42%).[6]

Personal life[edit]




Evan with his father Birch and mother Marvella during his father's 1962 senate campaign


Bayh was born in Shirkieville, Indiana, the son of Marvella Bayh (née Hern) and Birch Evans Bayh Jr., who was a U.S. Senator from 1963 until his 1981 defeat by then-Representative and future Vice President Dan Quayle.
Evan Bayh attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and graduated with honors with a B.S. in business administration from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington in 1978. At Indiana, he became a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity's Indiana Beta chapter. Bayh has an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Golden Gate University School of Law in California.[citation needed]
Bayh received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981, and clerked for a federal judge before entering private law practice in Indianapolis.[citation needed]
Bayh and his wife, Susan, have twin sons, born in 1995.[7] Susan Bayh serves on numerous corporate boards, including health insurance giant Anthem.[8] She was also, for many years, a law professor.[9]
Indiana state politics[edit]




As governor, Bayh implemented a $1.6 billion tax cut, the largest in state history, before Governor Mike Pence implemented one larger in 2013


After a debate over whether he met the state's five-year residency requirement to be on the ballot,[10] Bayh was elected Secretary of State of Indiana in 1986 and served from 1987-89.[citation needed]
Bayh was first elected Governor of Indiana in 1988, defeating former Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily in the Democratic primary. Bayh was the first Democrat to serve as Governor of Indiana in 20 years. Bayh defeated Republican John Mutz in the general election. He was re-elected governor in 1992 with 63% of the vote.[11] He defeated State Attorney General Linley E. Pearson, a Republican, to win his second term. By the end of his second term, Bayh had an approval rating of nearly 80 percent.[10]
Bayh was a vocal supporter of capital punishment.[12]
When his second term as governor ended in 1997, he accepted a lecturing position at his alma mater, the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington.[10] From 1997 to 1998, while he was campaigning for U.S. Senate, Bayh was also hired as a partner at Indianapolis law firm Baker & Daniels. In 1998, his Baker & Daniels salary was $265,000, according to Senate financial records. Indiana University paid him an additional $51,000 that year.[13]
United States Senator from Indiana[edit]


2004 campaign logo


Bayh was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998 to the seat that was once held by his father. He won with 64% of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a Democrat in a U.S. Senate race in Indiana, defeating former Fort Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke. Bayh carried all but four counties, including several that usually tilt Republican.[citation needed]
He easily won reelection in 2004, defeating Prof. Marvin Scott, receiving 62% of the vote—in the process, becoming only the fifth Indiana Democrat to be popularly elected to a second term in the Senate, and the first since his father.[citation needed]
During his Senate career, Bayh served on five Senate committees: Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, of which he was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance; Armed Services; the Select Committee on Intelligence; the Special Committee on Aging; and the Small Business Committee.[citation needed]
Bayh released an autobiography in 2003 entitled From Father to Son: A Private Life in the Public Eye. He describes growing up as the son of Senator Birch Bayh and emphasizes the importance of active, responsible fatherhood.[citation needed]
From 2001 to 2005, Bayh served as Chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). He is also a member of the Senate Centrist Coalition, helped establish the New Democrat Coalition, and founded the Moderate Dems Working Group.[14] Bayh also served on the Board of Directors of the National Endowment for Democracy.[15]
Bayh voted against confirming United States Attorney General John Ashcroft, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.[citation needed]
Bayh was an early supporter of the Bush administration's policies on Iraq.[16][17][18]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and Congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] He voted yes on reauthorizing the Patriot Act in 2006.[20]




Bayh speaking with Barack Obama on Air Force One in 2009


In the aftermath of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, Bayh joined with his fellow senators in hurrying to bail out U.S. financial institutions. Addressing the launch of the No Labels political organization, he "described a scene from 2008 where Ben Bernanke warned senators that the sky would collapse if the banks weren't rescued. 'We looked at each other,' said Bayh, 'and said, okay, what do we need.'"[21]
Retirement[edit]
See also: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2010
On February 15, 2010, Bayh announced he would not seek reelection to a third Senate term in the November 2, 2010 midterm election. Bayh's announcement came very shortly after former Senator Dan Coats declared his own candidacy for Bayh's Senate seat.[22] Because he made his announcement the day before the deadline for filing for the primary, no Democrat was able to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, so the state party committee chose Congressman Brad Ellsworth as the nominee.[23][24]
According to the Associated Press, Bayh spent a significant portion of his last year in office searching for a job, holding over four dozen meetings with potential corporate employers between February and December 2010.[25] He also cast votes on issues of interest to his future corporate employers.[25]
A CNN analysis of Bayh's internal 2009 schedule found that he "maneuvered behind the scenes" and "privately engaged with fundraisers, lobbyists and donors who had a keen interest on the issues dominating Capitol Hill," raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns. His meetings included sessions with lobbyists for the health insurance industry prior to his announcement that he would support the Affordable Care Act.[26]

Relationship between his Senate office and wife's corporate career[edit]
Susan Bayh, Evan Bayh's wife, has been described by the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette as a "professional board member" or "professional director", having been a director of fourteen corporations since 1994 and being a director of eight as of 2006.[27]
The Journal Gazette reported that since Susan Bayh began her career as a corporate director, “Sen. Evan Bayh [has] cast more than 3,000 votes, including some on issues of keen interest to the pharmaceutical, broadcast, insurance, food-distribution and finance industries".[27]
Since 2003, Bayh prohibited his staff from having lobbying contacts with his wife or representatives of the companies she directs. Bayh has insisted his wife’s ties have had no bearing on his congressional actions. “The reality is I don’t even know the people who run the vast majority of her companies. I’ve never even spoken to them,” Bayh told the Journal Gazette. “The reality is, we don’t talk about stuff that she’s involved with.”[27]

Bayh speaks during the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado


On December 1, 2006, news sources revealed that Bayh was creating a presidential exploratory committee.[28] Bayh confirmed these reports on December 3.[29] On December 15, 2006, Bayh announced that he would not run for president in 2008. He later endorsed Hillary Clinton.[30]
During the 2008 United States Presidential campaign, Bayh stated that he would accept an offer to be Barack Obama's running mate.[31] According to David Plouffe, it was a "coin toss" between Bayh and Joe Biden for Obama's pick for vice president, with Tim Kaine being a contender before deciding to focus on the DNC chairmanship.[32]
Post Senate career[edit]

After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, it was announced that Bayh would work as a strategic adviser on policy for the corporate law firm McGuireWoods LLP and as a senior adviser to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.[citation needed]
Bayh campaigned for Senator Joe Donnelly's two-day, five-city "main street tour," among other visits, and introduced Donnelly before his victory speech in Indiana's 2012 U.S. Senate election.[33][34][35]
As of the end of 2015, Bayh had just over $9 million in unspent campaign cash.[36][37]

Bayh's net worth soared to between $13.9 million and $48 million after he left office and began a post-Congress career with lobbying firms and corporate boards.[38] This was a significant increase over the $6.8-$8.0 million in assets he reported during his last year in Congress.[39] Bayh received over $6 million in compensation from salary, compensation from corporate boards, and speaking fees from January 2015 through October 2016.[38]
2016 U.S. Senate campaign[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Indiana, 2016
On July 11, 2016, CNN reported that Bayh was preparing to enter the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana to run for the seat being vacated by Dan Coats, who was retiring. Baron Hill, who won an uncontested primary to become the Democratic nominee on May 3, formally withdrew from the race on the same day to make way for Bayh's candidacy.[40][41]
Bayh ran into criticism in August 2016 over his residency status in Indiana. WFLI-TV reported that he was listed twice as an "inactive voter" in Indiana records.[42] CNN reported that Bayh repeatedly listed his two multimillion-dollar houses in Washington, D.C. as his primary residences, not his $53,000 condo in Indianapolis.[43] When asked by a local television reporter to state his Indiana address, he stated the wrong address.[44][45] In response, Bayh stated that he "voted in every primary and every general election for the last 25 to 30 years" and is "an active voter in Indiana," and when asked how often he is in Indiana, he stated, "all the time, frequently."[42]
Bayh was defeated by Republican Representative Todd Young in the November election.[6] Young won 52% of the vote to Bayh's 42%.[46][47]
Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Evan Bayh has a 100% rating by the NARAL.[48] He voted in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. He voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in 2004. He voted in favor of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2006.[49] He voted against an amendment to prohibit federal funds from going to groups that support coerced abortion. He repeatedly voted against amendments to prohibit federal funds from being used for abortions.[49]
Agriculture[edit]
Bayh voted for the 2002 Farm Bill that provided financial support accessible to rural communities. The bill provides funds for rural water and waste infrastructure. The Farm Bill also provides technology for rural residents' technical skills.[50]
Civil rights[edit]
Bayh has a mixed but left-leaning record on civil rights, having earned a 60% by the ACLU (2002), and 89% by the HRC (2006), and a 100% by the NAACP (2006). Some of his votes include a 1998 vote where Bayh voted to continue nonquota affirmative action programs. He voted to add sexual orientation under hate crime rules in both 2000 and 2002. In 2001, he voted yes to ease wiretapping restrictions. In 2006, he voted yes on a flag-burning constitutional amendment and no on an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[51]
Climate change[edit]
Bayh has been called "a fence-sitter on climate legislation," because he has stated concern about the effects of climate change but he also values cheap energy as beneficial to Indiana's manufacturing industry.[52] In 2008 he signed a letter expressing concerns with a cap-and-trade bill known as the Climate Security Act that was then on the Senate floor,[53] but he ultimately voted for the bill.[54] In 2010 he voted to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas pollution.[55]
Economy[edit]
At a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Bayh said:

What concerns me most about President Bush's tax and budget proposals, is that they threaten to undermine the foundation of the '90s' prosperity – replacing the "virtuous cycle" created by fiscal responsibility with a "vicious cycle" of deficits and debt, rising interest rates, and disinvestment. His proposals constitute a narrow ideological agenda, not an effective economic strategy, and completely fail to grasp the realities of the New Economy and the many requirements for economic success in the 21st Century.[56]

Education[edit]
As governor, Bayh created the 21st Century Scholars program, which promises at-risk middle school students full tuition scholarships in return for being drug, alcohol and crime-free and maintaining decent grades. Iowa and Wisconsin have both introduced legislation modeling Bayh's program.[57][58]
Energy[edit]
On September 11, 2008, Bayh joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan group designed to promote comprehensive energy reform.[59][better source needed]
Environment[edit]

Voted no on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land in December 2007.[51]
Voted yes on including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations in September 2005.[51]
Rated 74% by the League of Conservation Voters, indicating pro-environment votes, in December 2003.[51]
Voted no on confirming Gale Norton as Secretary of Interior in January 2001.[51]
Voted no on more funding for forest roads and fish habitat in September 1999.[51]
Voted to strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting in January 2007.[51]
Voted to restrict the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in June 2010).[citation needed]

Health care[edit]
Bayh introduced the Medicare Prescription Drug Emergency Guarantee Act of 2006 to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to assure uninterrupted access to necessary medicines under the Medicare prescription drug program.[60] Bayh proposed legislation he says could help cut health care insurance premiums by at least 20 percent for small businesses and individuals.[61] He voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (both 2010).[62][63]
Israel[edit]
Speaking to 2002 luncheon hosted by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, Bayh "described his lifelong affection for the state of Israel, beginning with a boyhood vacation there, and deepening with his many official visits as a governor and senator."[64][better source needed] He is also a member of AIPAC's advisory committee.[65]
Iran[edit]
Bayh appeared on CNN's Late Edition in January 2006[66] and referred to the "radical, almost delusional nature of the Iranian regime" and recent comments of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Holocaust is a "myth. [...] To deny history like this, this virulent anti-Semitism, their sponsoring of terrorism, their search for a nuclear weapon – ought to be a wake-up call to every American. Appeasement won't work. [...] We need to use diplomacy, economic sanctions, other means, so we won't have to resort to military action."[66]
Bayh introduced legislation in January 2006 that would impose sanctions on Iran.[67]
On January 20, 2006, Bayh introduced a resolution calling for economic sanctions on Iran, with the goal of deterring Iran from developing nuclear weapons.[68] In 2007, Bayh "supported the Kyl-Lieberman amendment that Obama made a key part of his critique of Clinton."[69][70]
Iraq[edit]




Bayh shakes the hand of a marine while visiting Iraq in January 2006


Bayh was an early supporter of the idea of removing Saddam Hussein from power for humanitarian reasons.[16]
On October 2, 2002, Bayh joined President George W. Bush and congressional leaders in a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain for co-sponsoring the resolution.[19] In 2006, Bayh criticized the conduct of the Iraq War:

It is clear to just about everyone but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history. And while we have been preoccupied with Iraq, under this President, North Korea has gone nuclear and Iran is on the verge of doing so.[71]

A blog from The Washington Post reported that in February 2006 Bayh was quoted saying: "We've got to be somewhere between 'cut and run' ... and mindlessly staying the course. You've got to have a sensible middle ground."[72]
Trade[edit]
During his time in the Senate, Bayh criticized trade policies of some countries, including China. Bayh's bipartisan Stopping Overseas Subsidies (SOS) Act was intended to allow the United States to enforce its antisubsidy laws abroad. He voted against CAFTA.[73]
Bayh placed a hold on the President's nominee to be the U.S. Trade Representative. After receiving several key commitments from nominee (now U.S. Senator) Rob Portman to get tough on China trade, Bayh agreed to release his hold.[74]

Born Birch Evans Bayh III on December 26, 1955, in Shirkieville, Indiana, he served as the junior U.S. Senator from Indiana. A graduate with honors in business economics and public policy from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, he received a J.D. Degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981. Backed with solid education, Bayh clerked for a federal judge before entering private law practice in Indianapolis. It was in 1986 that he was elected to land public office as the Secretary of State of Indiana. He held the post for two years, after which he completed two terms as a Governor and briefly took a job in lecturing at Indiana University Kelley School of Business. In the period from 1999 to 2011, he joined the U.S. Senate occupying a seat once held by his father, Birch Bayh. Once he left the Senate, Bayh partnered with the law and lobbying firm McGuireWoods in the firm's Washington, D.C., office, as well as he became a senior adviser with Apollo Global Management. In March 2011, he got hired as a Fox News contributor and later that year he also became a messaging adviser for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. What's more, he joined the board of directors at Berry Plastics Corp by the end of 2011.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Sometimes you have to make tough decisions to hold the line on spending.
Evan Bayh


Decisions,
Tough,
You



















Sometimes making progress a step at a time is better than no progress at all.
Evan Bayh


Time,
Progress,
Step
























America is stronger than ever. We will forever remember those we lost on September 11, 2001. In honoring their memory, we will remain true to our commitment to freedom and democracy.
Evan Bayh


Freedom,
Memory,
Commitment



















Across the country military families are facing dire financial circumstances due to longer than expected tours of duties. They are being penalized for their patriotism - no one should have to choose between doing right by their country and doing right by their families.
Evan Bayh


Patriotism,
Financial,
Doing



















China's island-building in the South China Sea poses a threat to U.S. national security interests in the region.
Evan Bayh


Sea,
Security,
China



















To win the war on terror, we must know who our friends are and where our enemies are hiding. We can't continue fighting terrorism using the same foreign policy blueprints that were in place before September 11th.
Evan Bayh


War,
Friends,
Know



















You now have six-year campaigns for the Senate - you never stop running. It's not uncommon for a member of the Senate to have a fundraising breakfast, a fundraising lunch and a fundraising dinner, and then when the Senate breaks for the week to go home, more fundraisers. And that's driven by the cost of campaigning.
Evan Bayh


Home,
Week,
Breakfast



















Mothers - especially single mothers - are heroic in their efforts to raise our nation's children, but men must also take responsibility for their children and recognize the impact they have on their families' well-being.
Evan Bayh


Children,
Parenting,
Men



















What is required from members of Congress and the public alike is a new spirit of devotion to the national welfare beyond party or self-interest.
Evan Bayh


Party,
Beyond,
New
























The amount of U.S. debt held by countries such as China and Japan is at a historic high, with foreign investors holding half of America's publicly held debt. This dependence raises the specter that other nations will be able to influence our policies in ways antithetical to American interests.
Evan Bayh


America,
American,
Influence



















We must do all we can to help improve the deplorable human rights situation of the North Korean people.
Evan Bayh


Help,
People,
Human



















We should be proud of liberating the 26 million people in Iraq and should remember that this is why it is important to stick it out to it's successful conclusion.
Evan Bayh


Proud,
Remember,
Successful



















People come into public life for different reasons. None of us are ego-challenged, I think, or we probably wouldn't be doing what we're doing, so if anyone tells you that they don't like the sound of the applause and the ego gratification, I don't think they're being straight with you.
Evan Bayh


Life,
Ego,
People



















My first meeting as a senator, my first day, they were already talking about the next election. Part of that's the permanent campaign, part of that's a word I've been using more frequently, 'tribal.' Our politics has become tribal: It's us versus them.
Evan Bayh


Politics,
Day,
Meeting



















Baseball may be our national pastime, but the age-old tradition of taking a swing at Congress is a sport with even deeper historical roots in the American experience. Since the founding of our country, citizens from Ben Franklin to David Letterman have made fun of their elected officials.
Evan Bayh


Experience,
Baseball,
Fun
























Challenges of historic import threaten America's future. Action on the deficit, economy, energy, health care and much more is imperative, yet our legislative institutions fail to act. Congress must be reformed.
Evan Bayh


Health,
Future,
Action



















Filibusters have proliferated because under current rules just one or two determined senators can stop the Senate from functioning. Today, the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to stop a vote; senators are rarely asked to pull all-nighters like Jimmy Stewart in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'
Evan Bayh


Today,
Rules,
Stop



















Of course, the genesis of a good portion of the gridlock in Congress does not reside in Congress itself. Ultimate reform will require each of us, as voters and Americans, to take a long look in the mirror, because in many ways, our representatives in Washington reflect the people who have sent them there.
Evan Bayh


Good,
Mirror,
Long



















As Indiana's governor, I balanced eight budgets, never raised taxes, and left the largest surplus in state history. It wasn't always easy. Cuts had to be made and some initiatives deferred. Occasionally I had to say 'no.'
Evan Bayh


History,
Easy,
Taxes



















I love working for the people of Indiana. I love helping our citizens make the most of their lives, but I do not love Congress.
Evan Bayh


Love,
People,
Working



















I've had a growing conviction that Congress is not operating as it should. There is much too much partisanship and not enough progress.
Evan Bayh


Progress,
Growing,
Too Much



















Hoosiers are very independent.
Evan Bayh


Independent,
Very
























What matters is moving forward and focusing on practical results for the American people.
Evan Bayh


Moving Forward,
Moving



















My father was on the Judiciary Committee all 18 years. He had a good personal relationship with Jim Eastland. They probably didn't agree on practically anything, or very little, from a public policy standpoint. But they were willing to work through that to see what they could get done just because they knew each other and liked each other.
Evan Bayh


Work,
Relationship,
Father



















While romanticizing the Senate of yore would be a mistake, it was certainly better in my father's time.
Evan Bayh


Time,
Father,
Better



















Sometimes, it takes leaving to gain some perspective. I see that clearly every time I leave Washington, D.C., and return to Indiana. I see the bizarre bubble that seems to enclose the Beltway and makes people forget what regular people care about.
Evan Bayh


Time,
Leaving,
Perspective
