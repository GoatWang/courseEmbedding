Michael G. Mullen
Senior Advisor


Admiral Mike Mullen is a senior advisor of Providence and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States government’s principal military advisor.  Considered perhaps one of the most influential chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in history, Admiral Mullen takes a fresh approach to the most important issues of the 21st century—including America's global positioning and how business trends and the economic health of the U.S. directly impact our national security.
Admiral Mullen was widely recognized as an “honest broker” in his key leadership roles as the top military advisor to two presidents—Barack Obama and George W. Bush— as well as to the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council. He continues to maintain strong relationships with leaders around the globe. He led the military during a critical period of transition, overseeing the end of the combat mission in Iraq and the development of a new military strategy for Afghanistan. He advocated for the rapid development and fielding of innovative technologies, championed emerging and enduring international partnerships, and advanced new methods for combating terrorism—all of which directly culminated in the elimination of Osama bin Laden. As the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs to have attended Harvard Business School’s executive program, Admiral Mullen sought the advice of economists, entrepreneurs, non-profit practitioners and even embraced social media both to inform himself and strengthen ties between the U.S. military and the nation. In an unprecedented in-depth feature article, Fast Company, called Admiral Mullen “not just a new model for military officers—and a new kind of business titan—but also a case study in 21st-century leadership.” Prior to becoming chairman, Admiral Mullen served as the 28th Chief of Naval Operations.  Prior to that, he served in leadership positions at the Naval Academy, in the Navy's Bureau of Personnel, in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and on the Navy Staff. He was the 32nd Vice Chief of Naval Operations.
Today he shares with audiences his deep experience in leading change in complex organizations, executive development and succession planning, diversity implementation, crisis management, strategic planning, budget policy, congressional relations, risk management, technical innovation and cyber security.
Admiral Mullen is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School, received a Master of Science in Operations Research from the Naval Postgraduate School and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968.
