Maneesh is probably the best kind of advisor and investor you could wish to have on your side. He isn't afraid to ask questions or say things that others might be too shy to ask or say. If you're... more not doing something right, he'll definitely let you know. No sugar coating or anything. If you can't mentally handle this kind of value-add, then you probably shouldn't be running a startup in the first place. Great to finally have him on board as both an investor and an advisor. Double win for us!

Founder of a company Maneesh Arora took an intro to














“


Maneesh pushes hard, asks tough questions, and is an active angel investor.  But he's also very real--the kind of guy you neither need to bullshit with nor do you have to treat like they're special.  He's available, helpful, and a great guy.  And he's running his own businesses, where here's going through the same challenges you probably will too in an early stage startup--so he gets it.

Maneesh has been very engaged with us. He is solidly on the entrepreneur's side but not afraid to give frank feedback and challenge you when he disagrees with something.

Exact Sciences is fueled by passion, innovation and Madison’s entrepreneurial spirit. People join Exact Sciences to generate real change. And together we have, pairing creativity with rigorous science to produce Cologuard®, then proving its performance in one of the largest clinical trials of its kind.
We began with strong science and successfully applied it to the development of a test that is changing human behavior—how people are screened for today’s second deadliest cancer. We built a flexible lab and customer care center that can be scaled to take on other cancers through early detection. And we did it all because of the remarkable people of Exact Sciences.
There is a new model for success. Meet the leadership team that is making it happen.

 Educational Background



Graduate 


University of California -  Los Angeles

                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.
