    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH

I've been to quite a few storage facilities over the years and this one is, by far, the best! The staff was so friendly and helpful, the grounds were incredibly clean and the process smooth. I would definitely recommend them to anyone I know that is looking to store.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Warrenton, VA


I've been to a number of storage facilities throughout the years. Not one of them can match CubeSmart as far as cleanliness, security, and in many other areas. The rates are highly competitive, I've even had an associate move into the same facility after visiting my unit.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Sanford, FL


I have used quite a few storage facilities in my time, and CubeSmart is the best one yet. The units and the grounds were very clean. The personal have been extremely nice and professional. I was impressed with the safety features such as lighting, cameras, and on-site management. I would definitely recommend it to friends!

Price, convenience, cleanliness, helpful staff -- you can't ask for more. Having used storage facilities a few times in my life, I can truly say this place puts all the others to shame. CubeSmart has it all.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Fairfax Station, VA


My husband and I have moved around many times to different parts of town and we have to move storage units every time. This is by far the BEST one we have used. The workers are so nice and it's so easy to pay my bill. Really grateful we came here!
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Tucson, AZ


I've had a few self-storage units over the years, depending on where I have lived, and CubeSmart has truly been the best experience, yet! Their customer service, friendliness, security features, and everything else overall has made me glad that with this last move, a CubeSmart was the most convenient self-storage facility!
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of El Paso, TX


Staff here is very fast and efficient. Also, very courteous, helpful, and friendly. Sign up and truck reserve/rental was accomplished excellently and without a hitch. Far above average experience in all areas compared with other local storage units I have used. Highly recommended.

This is the best self storage I have ever dealt with. Very helpful, great staff, a truck to rent, very clean, very secure...can't say enough good things about CubeSmart
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Columbus, OH


I have never used a self storage facility before and was very concerned about the safety, cleanliness and accessibility of a facility. I researched facilities and prices online and visited each facility on my "short list". I chose CubeSmart because of the competitive prices, the cleanliness of the building, storage space, and accessibility to my belongings. What really won me over? The friendliness of the staff. I really felt that they tried hard to get me the right space at the right price. They are always available to help and answer questions.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Boston, MA

    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH
