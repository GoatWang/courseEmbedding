Well kept and adorable University home. Character abounds, with hardwood floors in the living room, eat-in kitchen with lots of light, and sizable pantry closet. Two of the three bedrooms are wonderfully ample in size, one of which has some nice wood built-ins and the other which has a walk in closet and also a door to the outside. Newer carpets in two of the bedrooms. The large back yard is fairly private and has a couple patio areas great for lounging. The basement is a real plus with so much storage room. Furnace new in 2011. All this so very close to the University, walking, biking and hiking trails, and a quick jaunt to downtown! It's charming and wonderful and ready to move into.

                    Orchard Homes has been a developed part of Missoula since the late 1800s. Frank Higgins (son of C.P. Higgins-one of the founders of Missoula) resided in the Orchard Homes area. Among the newer subdivisions are still numerous large properties with homes from the early 1900s. You can still find old barns and 100 year-old apple trees in the area. In addition to the larger lots and old history, Orchard Homes is close to Clark Fork River access, Blue Mountain hiking, the bike path leading downtown, and a short drive from main shopping areas.

                    Missoula is a city on the rise. You can see it in the commercial and residential construction. It is a recreationalist's dream.  It is a large bowl shaped valley at the hub of five rivers and the fishing is fabulous. There is Rafting, Hiking, Camping, Bike Trails Galore, the University of Montana, Grizzly Sports, Ethnic Foods, Farmers Markets, Indoor and Outdoor Music Venues bringing some of the top acts around the country to town and so much more. 

There are a variety of neighborhoods often times architecturally significant to when they were built. Shopping districts include a Classic Downtown, Rife with Restaurants, Galleries and  Unique Shops in a variety of styles.  There is the Reserve Street Corridor for  a mix of Box Store Shopping and Restaurants and the newly rejuvenated Midtown / Southside Shopping District that runs, as the name suggests, from Midtown to the South end of the City. The center piece of the development is the currently under construction, Southgate Mall Addition, which includes a Lucky's Grocery and a Cineplex. There are Parks throughout, Missoula, Swimming Pools, Golf Courses, and even a Professional Baseball Team.

Need medical? Missoula features Two Great Medical Complexes. Saint Patrick's Hospital and Community Medical Center are State of the Art, world renowned Physicians and Surgeons as well as the International Heart Institute.

Missoula Has it All.

                    If you have your hopes set on an older home, in a great neighborhood, complete with original hardwood floors, archways, built-ins, or exposed brick look no further. The University district is all about location, however the homes will pull you in! Many have been well-maintained or updated without losing their character. They are often straight out of a story book. Every once in a while one will pop up that needs a little TLC to bring it's charm back which could be a great investment in this area. You'll see much higher price-tags in this area but with its high demand, rental-potential, and desirable location, you won't be disappointed. Nearby access to the Mount Sentinel trail systems make this a great spot for outdoor enthusiasts.
