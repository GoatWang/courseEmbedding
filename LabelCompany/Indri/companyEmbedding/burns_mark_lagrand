Some also feature Legrand's unique Tru-Universal technology, which allows the dimmer to adapt to any load and bulb type. These dimmers are compatible with a wide range of fixtures, including incandescent, LED and fluorescent lights, and come in styles such as paddle, motion sensor and touch. To select the appropriate dimmer, make sure to choose it based on the type of bulb it will control. You will need higher wattage styles to control larger chandeliers and light groupings.In addition to high-tech dimmers and light control solutions, 1800Lighting also carries many sleek wall plates from Legrand's adorne Collection. These good-looking light switch plates bring a stylish feel to your home and come in an amazing assortment of finishes and configurations to match your needs and preferences. You'll also want to shop Legrand's various adorne electrical outlets, which feature USB-compatible, Wi-Fi ready and pop-out outlet designs for an up-to-date appeal. The 1800Lighting team is an expert on Legrand products, so we're happy to help you find solutions that suit your space and budget. Never hesitate to reach out to us for advice.
