A SPECTACULAR SETTING
on the banks of the Potomac River. Sequoia Restaurant in Washington, DC with its floor to ceiling windows offers magnificent views of the Kennedy Center, Roosevelt Bridge, Roosevelt Island, Key Bridge and the Virginia skyline. Although it’s namesake, the Presidential yacht U.S.S. Sequoia, had a classical nautical design, we are currently undergoing major renovations (expected to be completed in April 2017) that will boast a more modern but faithful decor. Our chefs have created a delicious menu of modern American classics and scrumptious seafood choices.
SEQUOIA is owned and operated by ARK RESTAURANTS CORP, a New York based restaurant group.

HISTORY


The origin of Durgin-Park and its typically Yankee recipes goes back to the pre- revolutionary days.  In 1742 Peter Faneuil the topmost merchant in town, erected a large market house near the waterfront.  Soon afterwards, a warehouse was built which housed a small dining room that catered to market men, and the crews of ships anchored in Boston Harbor. 
Around 180 years ago, one of the customers, Eldridge Park bought the restaurant with local merchants, John Durgin and John Chandler.  Although both Mr. Durgin and Mr. Park died with in a few years of purchasing the restaurant, their partner retained their memory by naming it Durgin-Park.
Mr. Chandler spent the next 63 years running Durgin-Park with his son and grandson, Jerry Chandler. When Jerry was killed in WWII, the restaurant was sold to James Hallett who put the poem Just a Boy on the back of the menu to honor Jerry and all the fallen soldiers of that war.  It remains there to this day.
James Hallett and his infamous staff of playfully short-tempered waitresses served the freshest fish, meats and produce one could find in Boston, not to mention the famous Boston Baked Beans. In 1976, he sold Durgin-Park to the Kelley/Solimondo family who toned down the waitresses to sassy, but continued the tradition of nothing but the freshest Yankee Fare that could be found in Boston. Recently, it was sold to Ark Restaurant Corporation, who wouldn’t change a thing.
