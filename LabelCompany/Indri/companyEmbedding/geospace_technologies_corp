Since 1980, Geospace Technologies has provided the most innovative seismic solutions to the most demanding and diverse environments worldwide. The introduction of our field-proven wireless nodal seismic acquisition system, the Geospace Seismic Recorder (GSX), is just one recent example of this innovation. Through the combined strengths of its subsidiaries and its engineering team, Geospace Technologies designs, manufactures and deploys seismic instrumentation, real-time reservoir monitoring systems, wellbore solutions, marine seismic accessories, cable and umbilical systems, and thermal imaging solutions.  Geospace Technologies is a leading manufacturer and supplier of recording instrumentation solutions, precision sensors (geophones, hydrophones, vibration detectors and seismometers), and custom seismic cable assemblies and connectors for land and marine oil and gas exploration. Our sensor solutions also play integral roles in the security, industrial sensor and geotechnical engineering markets, which are gaining importance in an increasingly security- and safety-conscious world.
Geospace Technologies is headquartered in Houston, Texas. International offices are located in Canada, China, Russia, and the UK.  International manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and Russia.
 
 Geospace Engineering Resources International, known industry-wide as GERI, develops and deploys sophisticated seismic reservoir monitoring solutions. Such solutions are characterized by very large channel counts, fault tolerant operations, and real time acquisition. Data collected by our permanent and retrievable sea-floor and wellbore seismic solutions allow oil and gas engineers to actively monitor critical changes inside the reservoir. By acquiring more and better data, engineers dramatically enhance their operational and production decisions.
Geospace Engineering Resources International is headquartered in Houston, Texas. International offices are located in Canada, China, Russia, and the UK.  International manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and Russia.
 
Geospace Offshore designs and manufactures cable and umbilical products for the oilfield, remote operated vehicle (ROV) service industries, and the specialty cable markets. We produce technically challenging and operationally reliable cabling and umbilical solutions for electrical, fiber optic, electro-mechanical and electro-hydraulic applications.  Our manufacturing facilities are consciously designed to handle custom and near-custom work in a flexible, timely and cost-effective manner and are strategically located only 90 miles from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, one of the world’s most active offshore hydrocarbon regions.
 
EXILE Technologies is a leading manufacturer of computer to screen print solutions, professional-quality electronic prepress equipment and film products. Our products provide unique, reliable, affordable and chemistry-free thermal image solutions to an array of graphic display industries requiring large-format (12 to 54 inch wide) images with image resolutions ranging from 200 to 1,200 dpi.

Our community of employees serves a community of customers by providing equipment and services to help them make a profit. Our business activities serve a community of suppliers and shareholders who have put their trust in us by investing in our business. We best achieve our goal by operating from a set of core values.
Core Values
 
Safety
Safety is fundamental to us all. By keeping safety a priority, for ourselves, each other, and our customers, we strengthen our skills in every other Core Value. We are dedicated to protecting people, property, and the environment from harm.
Integrity
Integrity is our most valued principle. We will maintain high ethical standards in everything we do. We must be known for our honesty and sincerity. We are dedicated to complying with both the letter and spirit of the rules and laws that govern us. Our continued success requires unswerving adherence to these standards. Our business is highly competitive. Though we seek to expand our business aggressively, we must always compete fairly.
Respect
We respect other people. This creates an environment that promotes open communication, diverse ideas and approachable people. A respectful environment allows customers to express their needs with the expectation that we will listen. It also allows thoughtful responsiveness to customers’ needs.
Excellence
We take great pride in the quality of our work and are determined to achieve excellence in everything we do. Excellence is reflected by how we conduct ourselves as individuals and as a company. It’s reflected in the quality of the solutions we develop for our customers and the value they receive from our products and services.

Our collective creativity generates solutions for our customers and is the essence of differentiating us from our competitors.
Teamwork
We are all in this together. As long as we work together, there is no limit to the possibilities. The sum of our collaborative efforts is much larger than the sum of our individual efforts and in this manner our customers are best served.

You are here: Home / Product Listings / Reservoir CharacterizationReservoir Characterization

In operation in the North Sea since 2003, Geospace Technologies deployed the industry’s first and only large-scale permanent reservoir monitoring system at Valhall Field. Geospace Technologies’ SubSea System is delivering a proven solution for permanent reservoir monitoring at a time when operators are recognizing the long-term value of these investments. Thanks to our early technical and economic successes, we’re leading the way as the partner of choice to today’s oil and gas companies.
Geospace Engineering Resources International, known industry-wide as GERI, develops and deploys sophisticated seismic reservoir monitoring solutions. These solutions are characterized by very large channel counts, fault tolerant operations, and real time acquisition. Data collected by our permanent and retrievable sea-floor and well-bore seismic solutions allow oil and gas engineers to actively monitor critical changes inside the reservoir. Through acquisition of more and better data, engineers dramatically enhance their operational and production decisions over the life of the reservoir.

					Full Description



Geospace Technologies Corporation, incorporated on March 26, 2015, designs and manufactures instruments and equipment used by the oil and gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. The Company also designs and manufactures non-seismic products, including industrial products, offshore cables and imaging equipment. The Company operates through two segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic.Seismic ProductsThe Company's Seismic product segments include traditional exploration products, wireless exploration products and reservoir products. Its seismic product lines consist of land and marine nodal data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products. On land, its customers use geophones, leader wire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as streamers containing hydrophones, which are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel's data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis. Its marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel. Its products used in marine seismic data acquisition include its seismic streamer retrieval devices (SRDs). The Company's SRDs, which are attached to the streamer cables, contain air bags, which are designed to inflate automatically at a given water depth, bringing the severed streamer cables to the surface. It also produces seismic streamer steering devices, or birds, which are fin-like devices that attach to the streamer cable.The Company has developed a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system called the GSX. Its GSX system is designed into configurations ranging from 1 to 4 channels per station. It also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Its deep water versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters. The Company also develops permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields. The Company's high-definition reservoir monitoring products include the HDSeis product line and a suite of borehole and reservoir monitoring products and services. Its HDSeis system is a high-definition seismic data acquisition system with flexible architecture that allows it to be configured as a borehole seismic system or as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects. The Company's multi-component seismic product developments include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays and cases.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
