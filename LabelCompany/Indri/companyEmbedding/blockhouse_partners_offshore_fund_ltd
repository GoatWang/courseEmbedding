        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

Important Information 

Income Partners RMB Bond Fund (the “Fund”) invests primarily in RMB-denominated fixed income securities issued within the People's Republic of China ("PRC") directly through the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (“RQFII”) quota of Income Partners Asset Management (HK) Limited (the “Manager”).
The Fund is denominated in RMB and is subject to RMB currency risk. RMB is currently not freely convertible and is subject to exchange controls and restrictions. 

The Fund invests substantially in PRC bonds issued in mainland China and is subject to the risks relating to PRC bonds such as credit risk, credit rating related risks, risk relating to higher default bonds, interest rates risk, liquidity and valuation risks. The PRC bonds market may be subject to higher volatility compared to more developed markets.

The Fund may be subject to the risks associated with changes in the PRC laws and regulations, including PRC tax laws, and such changes may have retrospective effect. Investment in the China market is subject to emerging market risk including political, economic, legal, regulatory and liquidity risks.
The Fund invests in PRC securities through the RQFII quota of the Manager. It may not have exclusive use of the entire RQFII quota granted to the Manager. There is no assurance that the Manager will make available RQFII quota that is sufficient for the Fund’s investment at all times.
The Fund may invest in financial derivative instruments for hedging purposes. There is no guarantee that the hedging techniques will be effective.
The Manager may at its discretion pay distributions out of the capital of the Fund. Payment of distributions out of capital represents a return or withdrawal of part of the amount they originally invested or from any capital gains attributable to the original investment. Any such distributions may result in an immediate reduction of the net asset value per unit of the Fund. 
Investment involves risk. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results and no guarantee is being made that similar returns will be achieved in the future.
In making investment decisions, investors should not rely solely on the information in this website and should read the offering document of the Fund for further details including the risk factors.

For Distribution classes, fund performance is calculated on NAV to NAV basis in denominated currency with dividends re-invested. For Accumulation classes, fund performance is calculated on NAV to NAV basis in denominated currency.
YTD stands for year-to-date
^ Class 2B Distribution (RMB) is currently being the Sub-Fund’s largest unit class offered to the public in Hong Kong, which is viewed as the most appropriate representative share class. Returns are based on RMB currency. USD/HKD-based investors are therefore exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations.
# Since inception performance figures are annualized.
* The calendar performance figure is calculated from share class launch date to calendar year-end.
** Distribution classes aim to provide monthly dividends, the rate of dividend is however not guaranteed and may be paid out from the Fund’s capital. (Please refer to Important Information 7)

Please note that a positive dividend yield does not imply a positive return. Investors should not make any investment decision solely based on information contained in the table above. You should read the relevant offering document (including the Product Key Facts Statements) of the Fund for further details including the risk factors. The net distributable income means net investment income (i.e. dividend income and interest income net of fees and expenses) attributable to the relevant share class. The net investment income excludes realized and unrealized gains.
