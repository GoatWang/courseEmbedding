Rush Enterprises, Inc. Promotes Steven L. Keller and Derrek Weaver and Appoints Corey Lowe to Senior Vice President Positions

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rush Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:RUSHA) (Nasdaq:RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced the promotions of Steven L. Keller to Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Derrek Weaver to Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. The Company also appointed Corey Lowe to the newly created position of Senior Vice President of Peterbilt Dealerships. The promotions take effect immediately and all three executives will report to W. M. "Rusty" Rush, President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Rush Enterprises, Inc.

Steven L. Keller has served as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company since 2007. Mr. Keller has been intimately involved in the Company's finance and accounting functions since 1997 and will maintain responsibility for financial analysis and planning, business acquisitions, SEC reporting, investor relations and corporate taxes.  Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Keller, a Certified Public Accountant, worked in the San Antonio office of Ernst & Young L.L.P.  

Derrek Weaver has served as Vice President and General Counsel of the Company since 2010. Mr. Weaver remains responsible for overseeing the Company's legal department, general corporate governance matters and the legal aspects of business acquisitions and SEC reporting. Mr. Weaver served as the Company's Vice President of Legal Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer from February 2005, when he joined the Company, until 2010. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Weaver was an Associate Attorney at Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. in San Antonio, Texas, where he assisted the Company with acquisitions, SEC reporting and corporate governance matters beginning in 2002. 


 "Both Steve and Derrek are outstanding professionals in their fields and have been instrumental in the Company's ability to accomplish key growth initiatives including recent major business acquisitions," said W.M. "Rusty" Rush.  "Their continued leadership will no doubt benefit the Rush organization and contribute significantly to the Company's success in the future."

Corey Lowe has been appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President of Peterbilt Dealerships and will be responsible for overall dealership operations of the Company's Peterbilt Division. Mr. Lowe joined Rush in 1998 and has served as Regional Manager for the Company's North Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee dealerships since 2008, Regional General Manager for Rush Truck Centers in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008 and General Manager of the Company's Oklahoma City dealership from 2003 to 2006. 


 "I am pleased to name Corey Lowe to this new position. Corey has spent his entire career in the Rush Truck Centers dealership organization, and I am confident his expert knowledge of both the Peterbilt product line and dealership operations will contribute greatly to his success in this new role," said W.M. "Rusty" Rush. 


 Mr. Lowe will be a part of the senior management team of the Company's Peterbilt Division, which also includes David C. Orf, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Fleets and Specialized Equipment Sales, James E. Thor, Senior Vice President, Retail Sales and Daryl J. Gorup, Senior Vice President of Dealership Operations.   All four executives will work together to ensure the continued success of the Company. 


 "I am excited about these organizational changes, which I believe will allow me more time to focus on implementing the Company's strategies for growth, while still remaining involved in our operations," concluded W.M. "Rusty" Rush.

Steven Keller

 "I photograph the world around me in an effort to explore the didactic nature of emotional, visual textures - I am drawn to images that evoke emotion through both their simplicity and complexity.  My credo is simple: think, feel, imagine."Steven's work as a photographer explores his interests in the visual world around him.  He is particularly drawn to the conflict and/or harmony between the natural and the man-made. His work reflects a clear desire to express the harmony found in natural textures and man-made structures.  He is continuously examining the Japanese concept of Wabe Sabe - the belief that beauty lies in imperfection.  He focuses his lens on images that contain motion, tonal values, and evoke the desire to reach out and explore the tactile nature of his subjects.Adhering to Ansel Adam's notion that a photograph is the artist's interpretation of the scene, Steven uses digital photographic equipment to make his images reflect his own personal interpretations. He takes advantage of software tools to process his images. Steven frequently experiments with color saturation and intensity, creating images that are a cross between black and white and color. Steven has developed a method that brings out the tonal interest and textural details of an image, while retaining its realism.After studying studio art at UC Davis, Steven entered the photographic arts working at some of the world's leading commercial photographers in the mid-eighties.  He soon opened his own commercial studio.  Several years later, he shifted focus back to studio art, and embarked on a substantial career as an illustrator.  His illustration work earned him much success, has won awards and appeared in countless publications.  In 2008 he decided to shift is focus to fine art photography.
