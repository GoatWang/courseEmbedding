A skilled and proven leader whose experience spans nearly every aspect of technology research and development, financial risk management, business strategy, and marketing, Tomer Barel brings a unique breadth of insight and knowledge to his role as PayPal’s chief risk officer.
Tomer joined PayPal in 2009 to manage the successful integration of Fraud Sciences, an Israeli start-up acquired by eBay Inc. that developed break-through innovations in online fraud detection. He came to PayPal from 3DV Systems, a pioneer of imaging technology that enables video cameras to capture three dimensional objects and sense motion. As vice president of business development and marketing, Tomer oversaw the company’s strategic partnerships and led its marketing campaigns. Before 3DV Systems, Tomer worked for McKinsey & Company in Israel and the UK, advising leading businesses in retail, financial services, and health care on sales, business strategy, and acquisitions. He has also served in the Israeli military intelligence in various technology, product management and data collection roles.
In 2012, Tomer was named PayPal’s vice president of advanced risk sciences. In that role he led a team of 170 analysts and engineers working the United States, Israel, Ireland, and China that focused on development and deployment of automated risk management and fraud detection solutions. Named chief risk officer in 2013, Tomer is responsible for every aspect of risk management in PayPal, including regulatory, credit and financial risk, as he leads teams across the company that are dedicated to continually refining and improving PayPal’s industry-leading risk management systems.
