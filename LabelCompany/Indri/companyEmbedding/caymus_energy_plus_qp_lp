WHAT IS IT?
Local Pickup dramatically simplifies the wine delivery process by eliminating the need to wait for your order to arrive at your home or office. We ship your wine directly to one of thousands of pickup locations, so you can get your delivery whenever it's convenient for you. Many locations are even open nights and weekends.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
It's simple. Just choose Local Pickup in your cart at checkout. Select a location that works for you, and we'll send your order there. (Not available in some locations. Specific store locations available in checkout.) When it arrives, you'll receive an email notification. An adult signature is still required.

DOES STEWARDSHIP APPLY?
Yes! Your StewardShip free shipping benefit applies to every order sent everywhere, including the thousands of participating pickup locations across the country.

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING
I tried the Wine.com Local Pickup and it was a great experience from order entry to delivery. Selecting my most convenient FedEx Office was straightforward during the checkout process. My shipment was delivered to FedEx Office before 11 AM and was waiting for me on my way home from work. All of my future orders will use Wine.com Local Pickup and I'll be sure to tell my friends who are afraid to buy online because they can't be home all day for a delivery.- Collierville, TN I've enjoyed buying from Wine.com but delivery has been a hassle. With the new FedEx pickup program, I don't have to worry about being home. I can just stop at the FedEx store on my way home from work.- Dallas, TX

Caymus



    As the Wagner family celebrated the 40th anniversary of Caymus Vineyards in 2012, they thought back to 1972 which Charlie Wagner, Lorna Belle Glos Wagner and their son, Chuck, built their winery among the vines planted on the family's ranch in Rutherford, California - the center of the Napa Valley.  In 1975, the Wagners produced their first Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon, which remains the only wine to have twice been named Wine Spectator's "Wine of the Year" (1984 and 1990 vintage).

WHAT IS IT?
Local Pickup dramatically simplifies the wine delivery process by eliminating the need to wait for your order to arrive at your home or office. We ship your wine directly to one of thousands of pickup locations, so you can get your delivery whenever it's convenient for you. Many locations are even open nights and weekends.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
It's simple. Just choose Local Pickup in your cart at checkout. Select a location that works for you, and we'll send your order there. (Not available in some locations. Specific store locations available in checkout.) When it arrives, you'll receive an email notification. An adult signature is still required.

DOES STEWARDSHIP APPLY?
Yes! Your StewardShip free shipping benefit applies to every order sent everywhere, including the thousands of participating pickup locations across the country.

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING
I tried the Wine.com Local Pickup and it was a great experience from order entry to delivery. Selecting my most convenient FedEx Office was straightforward during the checkout process. My shipment was delivered to FedEx Office before 11 AM and was waiting for me on my way home from work. All of my future orders will use Wine.com Local Pickup and I'll be sure to tell my friends who are afraid to buy online because they can't be home all day for a delivery.- Collierville, TN I've enjoyed buying from Wine.com but delivery has been a hassle. With the new FedEx pickup program, I don't have to worry about being home. I can just stop at the FedEx store on my way home from work.- Dallas, TX
