John M. Fahey is chairman emeritus of the National Geographic Society. He was chief executive officer of the National Geographic Society from March 1998 to December 2013 and president of the organization from March 1998 to December 2010.
During his tenure as president and CEO, Fahey led an evolution of the National Geographic Society, including its entry into cable television with the National Geographic Channels, currently available in more than 440 million homes in 171 countries in 48 languages; the international growth of National Geographic magazine, now published in English and 40 local-language editions; and the extension of National Geographic content into virtually every aspect of digital media. In addition to continuing the Society's efforts to improve geographic literacy, Fahey guided the significant expansion of the Society's Mission Programs during the past decade, including the creation of the National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence, Fellows and Emerging Explorers programs. Fahey also spearheaded the Society's move into the creation of regional grant-making programs around the world, beginning in Northern Europe and Asia.
In 2011, he received Peru's highest civilian award, "Orden del Sol del Peru", for his and National Geographic's role in helping retrieve a collection of ancient artifacts taken from Machu Picchu in 1912.
Fahey joined National Geographic on April 1, 1996, as the first president and chief executive officer of National Geographic Ventures, the non-profit Society's wholly owned, taxable subsidiary. Prior to that, he was chairman, president and CEO of Time Life Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Time Warner Inc., for seven years. He worked previously for Home Box Office, where he was instrumental in the startup of CINEMAX. He also was a circulation manager for Time magazine.
In February 2014, President Obama appointed Fahey to a six-year term on the Smithsonian Board of Regents, the governing body of the Smithsonian Institution. He also serves on the board and executive committee of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History as well as the boards of Time Inc., where he is Chairman; Johnson Outdoors Inc.; and Lindblad Expeditions.
Born in New York City, Fahey received his B.S. in engineering from Manhattan College in 1973[1] and his M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. In 2008, he received the David D. Alger Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
Fahey was selected as one of Advertising Age's top 100 marketers and by Irish American magazine as one of the top 100 Irish Americans. He and his wife, Heidi, live in Washington, D.C. They have three kids: CJ, Kenny, and Allie (Allison).

Item Description: Seattle, WA : University of Washington Press, 2001. First Edition. Joseph R. Garry (1910-1975) , a Coeur d'Alene Indian, served six terms as president of the National Congress of American Indians in the 1950s. He led the battles to compel the federal government to honour treaties and landownership and dominated an era in government-Indian relations little attended by historians. Firmly believing that forced assimilation of Indians and termination of federal trusteeship over Native Americans and their reservations would doom Indian cultures, Garry had his greatest success as a leader in uniting American Indian tribes to fend off Congress's plan to abandon Indian citizens. Born into a chief's family and raised on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in northern Idaho, Garry rose to chairmanship of his tribal council, president of the Affiliated Tribes of the Northwest Indians, and leadership of NCAI. He was the first Native American elected to the Idaho House and Senate. Handsome, personable, and articulate, Garry travelled constantly to urge Indian tribes to hold onto their land, develop economic resources, and educate their young. In a turbulent decade, Garry elevated Indians to political and social participation in American life, and set in motion forces that underlie Indian relations today. An exceptional copy; fine in an equally fine dw. Particularly and surprisingly well-preserved; tight, bright, clean and especially sharp-cornered. Literally as new ; 8vo 8" - 9" tall; 220 pages; Description: xi, 220 p. : ill. ; 24 cm. Includes bibliographical references (p. 188-215) and index. Subjects: Garry, Joe, 1910-1975.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1977 edition. Volume: no.15 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Madison, Wis. : Forest Products Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service 38 pages Volume: no.15.  Bookseller Inventory # 457218729
