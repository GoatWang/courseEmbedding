Communities & Housing















Supporting community and housing initiatives










When FHLBI opened its doors on Oct. 15, 1932, the mission was to restore housing finance and revitalize homeownership after thousands of families lost their homes during the Great Depression. In 1989, Congress added the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) as another tool for FHLBanks to use to help families afford housing. Today, AHP is one of the most successful private sources of funding in the United States and has extended the FHLBanks’ original intent by furthering the idea that people deserve quality, affordable homes.
FHLBI grants help members partner with community developers and public agencies to develop affordable housing in their communities. FHLBI members have access to low-cost funding through our Homeownership Initiatives programs, competitive AHP grants and Community Investment Program (CIP) which support all stages of housing and community economic development.

See the 2016 Annual Report page of our Affordable Housing Advisory Council, which advises the bank on low- and moderate-income housing programs and housing needs in Indiana and Michigan. 
HOMEOWNERSHIP INITIATIVES​
In partnership with our members, FHLBI offers three grant programs designed to address the homeownership needs of families throughout the life cycle of homeownership:

the Homeownership Opportunities Program (HOP) to help first-time homebuyers with down payment assistance
the Neighborhood Impact Program (NIP) to assist low-income homeowners with home repairs; and
the Accessibility Modifications Program (AMP)  to aid seniors and households with disabled family members with home modifications that will allow them to remain in their current homes.

COMPETITIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM
Each year FHLBI members partner with local not-for-profit housing providers, economic development  ​partners and housing developers to compete for Affordable Housing Program (AHP) grants of up to $500,000 per project.  These housing grants have changed lives and communities across Indiana and Michigan.  Since 1990 the FHLBI has awarded over $253 million ​to create or rehabilitate single- and multi-family affordable housing. The Competitive AHP funds ​projects ​involving the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of properties for families with annual incomes that are 80% or less than the area median income (AMI).  Learn more about the Competitive Affordable Housing Program.
 
COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM
Through its Community Investment Program (CIP), FHLBI provides members with at-cost loans and letters of credit to support affordable housing and community economic development activities that benefit low- and moderate-income families or neighborhoods. These funds can be used to develop affordable housing, for infrastructure improvements, or to support local job creation. Through CIP, our members are making an incredible impact on their communities every day.  Learn more about CIP Advances.

COMMUNITY SPIRIT AWARDS
Each year, FHLBI honors an individual from one Indiana and one Michigan member institution who shows an outstanding dedication to affordable housing and community economic development. For more information about the awards and nomination criteria, read  Community Spirit Award page. 



COMMUNITY SUPPORT ​REVIEW
The community support regulation (12 CFR Part 1291) requires each member of FHLBI to submit a community support statement approximately once every two years. Each FHLBI member will receive a copy of the notice and the forms needed to comply with the requirement. Concurrently, the Bank will notify the FHLBI Advisory Council and nonprofit housing developers, community groups, and other interested parties in the district of the name of each member selected for review.

The Community Support Statement Form, required by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is available to view.   Additional information relating to the form, community support requirement, and listing of current members selected for review are noted below.

The department can be divided into three major units including infrastructure, information security, and project management. The company is currently looking for a new Chief Information Officer (CIO) following the departure of former CIO, Karen Kotowski. 
 
 The Infrastructure unit oversees the development and support of the institution’s technology resources which provide the platform for its specific enterprise systems and applications. Personnel in this group are responsible for the development and support of the institution’s data warehouse, database environment, and service delivery operations.


 The Information Security unit oversees the institution’s security program including user provisioning and network and application security. The company is planning to increase security spending in policy compliance and enforcement, mobile security, physical security, premises network security, technical and forensic auditing, and security information and event management (SIEM). The company is planning to evaluate secured and/or privileged administrator accounts, a federated identity security and single sign-on solution, threat detection technologies, SIEM, and centralized directory system initiatives in the next 6-12 months. It uses Symantec as its storage security solution. Personnel are also responsible for overseeing its internal auditing operations.

 Regarding security safeguards, the company has regular policy reviews, inventory of personal employee and customer data, inventory of locations where data is stored, documented incident response processes, inventory of third parties, encrypted mobile devices, and malware and virus protection on all devices. The company also has a regular compliance review process and a continuous compliance model in place that operates under HIPAA, ISO/IEC 27001/27002, and SOX compliance regimes. FHLB uses an MSSP (Solutionary) technology to monitor threats across its networks, security devices, and data. 

 The Project Management unit is responsible for planning and executing IT initiatives focused on replacing legacy systems and implementing innovative technologies within the institution.

 Personnel in the department are also responsible for procurement and vendor management operations.  

 The company's IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.

Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]

Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

How We Serve
The Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLBI) is a regional wholesale bank that has been meeting the liquidity needs of member financial institutions throughout Indiana and Michigan since 1932. Our core mission is to provide a reliable source of liquidity to member banks, credit unions, community development financial institutions, and insurance companies to support housing finance, asset-liability management, and community lending.  We also help communities and families through grants and low-cost loans to our members that help support affordable housing and economic development initiatives.

FHLBI is one of 11 regional banks that make up the Federal Home Loan Bank System. FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises created by Congress to ensure access to low-cost funding for their member financial institutions. FHLBanks are privately capitalized and funded, and receive no Congressional appropriations. The FHLBI is owned by its approximately 400 Indiana and Michigan financial institution members. Watch this 60 second video to learn more about how the FHLBanks support a nation of local lenders.
