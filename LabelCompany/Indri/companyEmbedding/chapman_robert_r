How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Chapman Robert R carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Chapman Robert R currently holds license 9279, ME-9279 (Me Master Electrician, Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Chapman Robert R



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Chapman Robert R



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Chapman Robert R



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

Description



Although he is not widely known today, Robert Chapman was one of the most respected Christians of his generation. His caring and humble attitude had a marked impact on the lives of such men as George Müller, J. Hudson Taylor, John Nelson Darby, and Charles Spurgeon. These notable men agreed that Chapman was a giant among them. This remarkable man served God in the small town of Barnstaple, England, during the nineteenth century. Chapman deliberately avoided publicity because he did not want the attention that rightly belonged to the Lord. Yet at the end of his life he was known throughout the world for his great compassion, wisdom, and love. He is noted as saying, “My business is to love and not to seek that others shall love me.” Robert Chapman: A Biography cannot help but challenge the Lord’s people to deepen their devotion to Christ and love others more selflessly.

Endorsements“J.C. Ryle you’ve likely heard of, likewise J.N. Darby and C.H. Spurgeon. But what of R.C. Chapman? What if I told you that Darby said of Chapman, “he lives what I teach”? And that Spurgeon referred to Chapman as “the saintliest man I ever knew”? Would you want to learn more about this Victorian-era figure? If so, I would counsel you to procure Robert L. Peterson’s biography of Robert Chapman, Apostle of Love….a well-paced and interesting account of Chapman’s life and ministry.”
– Mark Tubbs discerningreader.com

“This is a fascinating and inspiring account of a little known saintly man and provides some interesting insights into the churches of the 19th century and the growth of the Brethren movement. You can’t read this and fail to be humbled by the example of such a Christ-like man while, at the same time, being drawn afresh to the Christ he served so selflessly and faithfully for so many years.”
– John Brand Principal, Faith Mission Bible College, Edinburgh
