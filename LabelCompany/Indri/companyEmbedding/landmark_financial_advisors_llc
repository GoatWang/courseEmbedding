1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

Federal Govt Status
In  Government by Landmark Financial Advisors, LLCJuly 13, 20150 Comments

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported a June budget surplus for the federal government, which is typically a positive month.  Here are a few points from the release:

Federal receipts rose 8.8% y/y led by a pickup in individual income tax receipts.
Federal outlays rose a smaller 4.4% y/y.  Spending on national defense and income security continue to contract. Additionally, net interest payments declined 1.2% y/y, partly because low inflation reduced the principal of TIPS.
Fiscal year-to-date, the deficit totaled $313.4 billion, down 14.3% from the same period a year ago. The CBO projects a deficit of $468 billion this fiscal year.

A couple of key takeaways:

Tax increases have been a big hit for the federal government.  We would question why additional increases are needed when the growth rate is this high.
Interest rates won’t stay low forever.  Our debt has mushroomed in the last 7 years, but yet our interest debt service has declined.  This has been a huge positive for the federal government and will not be repeated going forward.

In summary, the risks in our fiscal house have declined significantly thanks in large part to a substantial tax increase.  The CBO still forecasts deficits into the foreseeable future, which is not good or sustainable.  In effect, our politicians have borrowed some time to make some tough decisions.  If they elect to go the easy route of increased taxes again to solve the problem this could spell trouble.  A mix of controlling/constraining/cutting entitlements will be needed in our opinion.
One lesson from the Greek drama of the last few weeks…. debt works until it doesn’t.

Happy (almost) New Year!
In  Uncategorized by Landmark Financial Advisors, LLCDecember 31, 20140 Comments

Wishing all a prosperous and blessed start to 2015.  The following is a timely poem by Art Cashin:
‘Tis the day before New Year’s
and despite what you’re hopin’
The folks in the Boardroom
say “the full day we’re open”
So we’ll buy and we’ll sell
as the tape crawls along
And though “Bubbly’s” verboten
we may still sing a song
Two Thousand Fourteen
was okay, not really a wow
Till a Santa Claus rally
took us through Eighteen Thou
We lost special people
as we seem to each year
It just makes us treasure
each one that’s still here
Robin Williams, so manic
snuffed out his own light
Mickey Rooney’s gone also
into Dylan’s Good Night
Joan Rivers departed
when a doctor slipped up
And Sid Caesar now sips
from a heavenly cup
James Garner, “Bret Maverick”
has played his last hand
Polly Bergen now sings
in an Angelic band
Eli Wallach needs no badges
he’s got wings, I’ve a hunch
Elaine Stritch found a new place
now with cherubs she’ll lunch
Hurricane Carter
has thrown his last punch
Ann B. Davis as “Alice”
no longer waits on the “Bunch”
Bacall, who could whistle
took her last curtain call
Philip Seymour Hoffman
is now just down the hall
Casey Kasem’s now listing
Top 40 harp songs
Mayor Barry departed
moving on past his wrongs
Mike Nichols graduated
to Mrs. Robinson’s place
Ruby Dee now also
fills heaven with grace
Ben Bradlee followed Nixon
for one final time
Maya Angelou tells St. Peter
her favorite new rhyme
Oscar De La Renta
designed his last gown
“Adam Smith” (Jerry Goodman)
he has also left town
The threat of Ebola
made everyone fear
‘So Time made health workers
their Man of the Year
Kim K bared her assets
glossed up till they shone
But most folks on the net shrugged
and left the whole thing alone
Some guy near the White House
hopped up over the wall
And since the door was unlocked
he just strolled down the hall
The ice bucket challenge
made some hairdos a mess
But it raised lots of money
to help fight ALS
In their Little League Series
one kid pitched a pearl
As a young lady showed us
how to “throw like a girl”
Polar Vortex froze business
The year started out rough
But when we got defrosted
things seemed to go well enough
There were shootings, then lootings
things kept turning bizarre
Until a mad man came North
to shoot two cops in a car
We saw ISIS beheadings
and car bombs galore
Sadly, three different airliners
got half way but no more
Brad wed Angelina
and George Clooney – Amal
But some folks like Don Sterling
could not find any pal
There were midterm elections
The GOP did quite well
Will that help them to govern?
It’s way too early to tell
Sony thought it terrific
and they’d have lots of fun
If they made a joke movie
in which they killed Kim Jung Un
Derek Jeter retired
one game at a time
In most states, gay marriage
is no longer a crime
The NFL fumbled
on domestic abuse
We didn’t see the whole tape
was their only excuse
Rolling Stone ran a story
that they later withdrew
And more women blamed Cosby
saying the press really knew
Gwyneth Paltrow “decoupled”
Taylor Swift told streamers “No!”
In the kid’s movie Frozen
Elsa sang “Let it go”
Let not this year’s memories
of sadness or sleaze
Disturb you this day
just give your heart ease
Have faith that this New Year
will bring a new sign
And believe in yourself
it will all work out fine
Just lift up your spirits
and some fruit of the vine
And kiss ye a loved one
and sing Auld Lange Syne
And late in the evening
as you watch the ball fall
Wish yourself all the best
Happy New Year to All!!

Objective, as-needed Fee-Only financial planning and advice.
What is Financial Planning?
  
Financial planning is the process of organizing your finances and resources to ensure that you live within your means, protect and provide for yourself and your family, and enjoy a dignified retirement - free from insecurity or dependence on others. Most importantly, it's a process of taking control of your circumstances and achieving genuine financial peace of mind.
Why Plan?  
Because planning helps to ensure that you will achieve your most cherished lifetime financial objectives (and because failing to plan is an expensive alternative). Consider the following:
 
Independent research by the Consumer Federation of America found that Americans with financial plans accumulate twice the savings of those without, and that "Americans of all income levels are more comfortable, confident, and are making more progress toward their goals  --  if they have a financial roadmap." 
 
  
Why Choose Landmark?
 
Because we help our clients make better financial decisions which improve the quality of their lives.
 
Here are three important reasons why we feel Landmark Financial is your best choice for professional financial planning and advice, and why we ask you to consider us:  
We do more for youWe treat your finances like our ownWe save you money 
 
F We do more for you. Plenty of people call themselves "financial advisors." Few of them are genuine financial planners. There are important differences between financial advisors and financial planners, and what each is able to do for you. Financial advisors often limit their advice to some specific aspect of your financial situation, like managing your investments, for instance. Financial planners, by comparison, are broadly-skilled to deal with the entirety of your financial life. We are financial planners. 
 
F We treat your finances like our own. In a manner of speaking, we "eat our own cooking." We recommend to you the same approaches and services that we've found to be effective for our own planning and investing needs, and we help you to implement them in the same low-cost way. By working with us, you eliminate the need for expensive brokers, agents, and other advisors. 
 
F We save you money. To be blunt, we believe there is a significant conflict of interest if an advisor stands to gain financially from any advice or recommendations you may follow. Unlike the majority of financial advisors and financial planning firms, we receive no commissions from the sale of products. Landmark Financial is a strictly Fee-Only financial planning and investment advisory firm, which means that we are compensated solely and directly by the client. Because we do not sell investments or insurance of any kind, we are able to maintain absolute objectivity and are completely free to help you implement your investment and insurance solutions in the most economical way possible, including the use of low-cost, "no-load" mutual funds and life insurance (where available).  
 
You Don't Have To Do It Yourself!
 
Whether you have a simple concern that requires an immediate, objective solution, or you are looking to transform your life through comprehensive financial planning, we can help you.
We know you'll find our approach to conflict-free financial planning and advice a refreshing alternative to pricey commission-based advisors and brokers. Please call us at 585-381-2390 to schedule a no-obligation Get Acquainted meeting. Thank you.

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

Getting started may feel challenging. But with our help and a financial plan to guide you, you can soon feel more confident about the road ahead.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
