Title: Board Member
               Company: Hebrew Seminary of The Deaf
Job Details
               The Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf is a unique, pluralistic egalitarian school; our students learn Jewish ethics, thought, religion and history, and gain an in-depth understanding of the deaf culture. The Seminary's five-year program also includes all of the standard curriculum and courses of study required for rabbinical ordination. In addition, all students must become proficient signers in American Sign Language as well as learning Hebrew Sign Language. These skills will enable them, as rabbis and teachers, to communicate easily and directly with the Jewish deaf communities and congregations throughout the United States that they will eventually serve. We are also proud that the study of Kabbalah and healing meditative practices is an important part of our curriculum.
