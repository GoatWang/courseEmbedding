Allan Anthony Donald (born 20 October 1966) is a former South African cricketer and one of their most successful pace bowlers. He was nicknamed 'White Lightning'
He was one of the top fast bowlers in Test cricket, reaching the top of the ICC Test rankings in 1998 and peaked with a top ICC ranking of 895 points the next year. In ODIs, he reached 794 points in 1998, ranked second behind teammate Shaun Pollock. He shared the new-ball with Pollock from the 1996/1997 tour of India until his retirement in 2002.
He made his Test debut on 18 April 1992 in South Africa's first test since their return to world sport after the abolition of apartheid. South Africa lost to the West Indies in Barbados by 52 runs. Donald took 2–67 and 4–77, including the wicket of Brian Lara.
When he retired, he was South Africa's record wicket-taker with 330 Test wickets at an average of 22.25, and claimed 272 One Day International wickets at an average of 21.78. Both of these records have now been overtaken by Shaun Pollock.

Career[edit]




A graph showing Donald's test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time.


In 1997 Donald "got involved in an incident that has since caused [him] a lot of grief", Donald was being hit around the park by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in the finals of a one-day series. Donald says he got carried away and confronted Dravid face-to-face saying "This isn't such a fucking easy game". The TV cameras filmed close up shots of the incident, leadiing to accusations that he was a racist.[1]
During the Trent Bridge Test Match of 1998 South Africa batted first, scoring 374 in their first innings. England responded with 336, with Donald taking 5 wickets. In their second innings, South Africa only scored 208 leaving England a target of 247 to win the match. Michael Atherton was at the crease when Donald began a spell of bowling both would later describe in their respective autobiographies as one of the most intense periods of Test Match Cricket they ever played. Donald bowled multiple bouncers to Atherton, but he survived several close chances to remain not out at the end of the day. The next day Atherton along with Alec Stewart were able to score the remaining runs, with Atherton finishing on 98. Several years later, Atherton gave Donald the gloves he wore on this occasion for Donald's benefit year auction.[2]
In the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia Donald was the last batsman on the South African team.[3] Australia batting first making only 213, Donald taking 4–32 and Pollock 5–36. The game swung back and forth with South Africa eventually needing to score 16 runs off the last 8 balls to win with only one wicket remaining. Lance Klusener and Allan Donald were at the crease. Klusner hit a six and then a single to keep the strike, followed by two fours. The scores were level with four balls left in the game. The next ball resulted in no run. Klusner hit the ball after that straight down the ground and set off for a single, but Donald was watching the ball, and missed the call to run. Both batsmen were at the bowler's end before Donald started running, having dropped his bat. The ball was thrown to the bowler, then to Gilchrist, who broke the stumps at the other end, with Donald only halfway down the pitch. Although the match technically ended in a tie, South Africa had previously lost to Australia in the Super-Six phase, and needed to win outright to progress to the final.
Outside International Cricket[edit]
In English county cricket, Donald enjoyed a long and highly successful career with Warwickshire. He also played a single match for Worcestershire in 2002. Having retired from playing, he now commentates for South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) in their coverage of South Africa's home Tests, alongside former teammate Daryll Cullinan. In May 2007, Allan Donald was appointed as a temporary bowling consultant for the England cricket team. His involvement impressed many, and was praised by several players. Donald's original brief contract was extended until September 2007. Donald decided not to continue with his coaching role at the end of September 2007 citing the strain of touring and his wish to be with his family.[4] Donald was a coach at Warwickshire County Cricket Club, and in partnership with fellow coach Ashley Giles helped the county to win the Second Division of the County Championship in 2008.
Allan Donald coached the reigning domestic champions, Mountaineers, (a franchise team) in Zimbabwe [5] and is the bowling coach for the New Zealand cricket team for the ODI series against Pakistan and the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[6] New Zealand team beat South Africa in the semifinal match of the World Cup.
In July 2011, Allan Donald was drafted into Gary Kirsten's coaching team as bowling coach to the South African cricket team. Kirsten left his post in May 2013, and Russell Domingo was appointed as his replacement. Donald was the bowling coach of South Africa, under head-coach Domingo, he has since been replaced by Charl Langeveldt. Donald is also the coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise in the Indian Premier League.[7]
On 30 April 2017, Sri Lanka hired Donald as bowling consultant for Champions Trophy.[8]Donald said that his endeavour was to play an "inspirational role" and he would be working closely with the squad to assess their individual goals, health condition and personalities. He will work alongside Sri Lanka head coach Graham Ford, a fellow South African,[9]

Allan Anthony Donald (born 20 October 1966) is a former South African cricketer and one of their most successful pace bowlers. He was nicknamed 'White Lightning'
He was one of the top fast bowlers in Test cricket, reaching the top of the ICC Test rankings in 1998 and peaked with a top ICC ranking of 895 points the next year. In ODIs, he reached 794 points in 1998, ranked second behind teammate Shaun Pollock. He shared the new-ball with Pollock from the 1996/1997 tour of India until his retirement in 2002.
He made his Test debut on 18 April 1992 in South Africa's first test since their return to world sport after the abolition of apartheid. South Africa lost to the West Indies in Barbados by 52 runs. Donald took 2–67 and 4–77, including the wicket of Brian Lara.
When he retired, he was South Africa's record wicket-taker with 330 Test wickets at an average of 22.25, and claimed 272 One Day International wickets at an average of 21.78. Both of these records have now been overtaken by Shaun Pollock.

Career[edit]




A graph showing Donald's test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time.


In 1997 Donald "got involved in an incident that has since caused [him] a lot of grief", Donald was being hit around the park by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in the finals of a one-day series. Donald says he got carried away and confronted Dravid face-to-face saying "This isn't such a fucking easy game". The TV cameras filmed close up shots of the incident, leadiing to accusations that he was a racist.[1]
During the Trent Bridge Test Match of 1998 South Africa batted first, scoring 374 in their first innings. England responded with 336, with Donald taking 5 wickets. In their second innings, South Africa only scored 208 leaving England a target of 247 to win the match. Michael Atherton was at the crease when Donald began a spell of bowling both would later describe in their respective autobiographies as one of the most intense periods of Test Match Cricket they ever played. Donald bowled multiple bouncers to Atherton, but he survived several close chances to remain not out at the end of the day. The next day Atherton along with Alec Stewart were able to score the remaining runs, with Atherton finishing on 98. Several years later, Atherton gave Donald the gloves he wore on this occasion for Donald's benefit year auction.[2]
In the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia Donald was the last batsman on the South African team.[3] Australia batting first making only 213, Donald taking 4–32 and Pollock 5–36. The game swung back and forth with South Africa eventually needing to score 16 runs off the last 8 balls to win with only one wicket remaining. Lance Klusener and Allan Donald were at the crease. Klusner hit a six and then a single to keep the strike, followed by two fours. The scores were level with four balls left in the game. The next ball resulted in no run. Klusner hit the ball after that straight down the ground and set off for a single, but Donald was watching the ball, and missed the call to run. Both batsmen were at the bowler's end before Donald started running, having dropped his bat. The ball was thrown to the bowler, then to Gilchrist, who broke the stumps at the other end, with Donald only halfway down the pitch. Although the match technically ended in a tie, South Africa had previously lost to Australia in the Super-Six phase, and needed to win outright to progress to the final.
Outside International Cricket[edit]
In English county cricket, Donald enjoyed a long and highly successful career with Warwickshire. He also played a single match for Worcestershire in 2002. Having retired from playing, he now commentates for South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) in their coverage of South Africa's home Tests, alongside former teammate Daryll Cullinan. In May 2007, Allan Donald was appointed as a temporary bowling consultant for the England cricket team. His involvement impressed many, and was praised by several players. Donald's original brief contract was extended until September 2007. Donald decided not to continue with his coaching role at the end of September 2007 citing the strain of touring and his wish to be with his family.[4] Donald was a coach at Warwickshire County Cricket Club, and in partnership with fellow coach Ashley Giles helped the county to win the Second Division of the County Championship in 2008.
Allan Donald coached the reigning domestic champions, Mountaineers, (a franchise team) in Zimbabwe [5] and is the bowling coach for the New Zealand cricket team for the ODI series against Pakistan and the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[6] New Zealand team beat South Africa in the semifinal match of the World Cup.
In July 2011, Allan Donald was drafted into Gary Kirsten's coaching team as bowling coach to the South African cricket team. Kirsten left his post in May 2013, and Russell Domingo was appointed as his replacement. Donald was the bowling coach of South Africa, under head-coach Domingo, he has since been replaced by Charl Langeveldt. Donald is also the coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise in the Indian Premier League.[7]
On 30 April 2017, Sri Lanka hired Donald as bowling consultant for Champions Trophy.[8]Donald said that his endeavour was to play an "inspirational role" and he would be working closely with the squad to assess their individual goals, health condition and personalities. He will work alongside Sri Lanka head coach Graham Ford, a fellow South African,[9]

Allan Anthony Donald (born 20 October 1966) is a former South African cricketer and one of their most successful pace bowlers. He was nicknamed 'White Lightning'
He was one of the top fast bowlers in Test cricket, reaching the top of the ICC Test rankings in 1998 and peaked with a top ICC ranking of 895 points the next year. In ODIs, he reached 794 points in 1998, ranked second behind teammate Shaun Pollock. He shared the new-ball with Pollock from the 1996/1997 tour of India until his retirement in 2002.
He made his Test debut on 18 April 1992 in South Africa's first test since their return to world sport after the abolition of apartheid. South Africa lost to the West Indies in Barbados by 52 runs. Donald took 2–67 and 4–77, including the wicket of Brian Lara.
When he retired, he was South Africa's record wicket-taker with 330 Test wickets at an average of 22.25, and claimed 272 One Day International wickets at an average of 21.78. Both of these records have now been overtaken by Shaun Pollock.

Career[edit]




A graph showing Donald's test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time.


In 1997 Donald "got involved in an incident that has since caused [him] a lot of grief", Donald was being hit around the park by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in the finals of a one-day series. Donald says he got carried away and confronted Dravid face-to-face saying "This isn't such a fucking easy game". The TV cameras filmed close up shots of the incident, leadiing to accusations that he was a racist.[1]
During the Trent Bridge Test Match of 1998 South Africa batted first, scoring 374 in their first innings. England responded with 336, with Donald taking 5 wickets. In their second innings, South Africa only scored 208 leaving England a target of 247 to win the match. Michael Atherton was at the crease when Donald began a spell of bowling both would later describe in their respective autobiographies as one of the most intense periods of Test Match Cricket they ever played. Donald bowled multiple bouncers to Atherton, but he survived several close chances to remain not out at the end of the day. The next day Atherton along with Alec Stewart were able to score the remaining runs, with Atherton finishing on 98. Several years later, Atherton gave Donald the gloves he wore on this occasion for Donald's benefit year auction.[2]
In the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia Donald was the last batsman on the South African team.[3] Australia batting first making only 213, Donald taking 4–32 and Pollock 5–36. The game swung back and forth with South Africa eventually needing to score 16 runs off the last 8 balls to win with only one wicket remaining. Lance Klusener and Allan Donald were at the crease. Klusner hit a six and then a single to keep the strike, followed by two fours. The scores were level with four balls left in the game. The next ball resulted in no run. Klusner hit the ball after that straight down the ground and set off for a single, but Donald was watching the ball, and missed the call to run. Both batsmen were at the bowler's end before Donald started running, having dropped his bat. The ball was thrown to the bowler, then to Gilchrist, who broke the stumps at the other end, with Donald only halfway down the pitch. Although the match technically ended in a tie, South Africa had previously lost to Australia in the Super-Six phase, and needed to win outright to progress to the final.
Outside International Cricket[edit]
In English county cricket, Donald enjoyed a long and highly successful career with Warwickshire. He also played a single match for Worcestershire in 2002. Having retired from playing, he now commentates for South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) in their coverage of South Africa's home Tests, alongside former teammate Daryll Cullinan. In May 2007, Allan Donald was appointed as a temporary bowling consultant for the England cricket team. His involvement impressed many, and was praised by several players. Donald's original brief contract was extended until September 2007. Donald decided not to continue with his coaching role at the end of September 2007 citing the strain of touring and his wish to be with his family.[4] Donald was a coach at Warwickshire County Cricket Club, and in partnership with fellow coach Ashley Giles helped the county to win the Second Division of the County Championship in 2008.
Allan Donald coached the reigning domestic champions, Mountaineers, (a franchise team) in Zimbabwe [5] and is the bowling coach for the New Zealand cricket team for the ODI series against Pakistan and the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[6] New Zealand team beat South Africa in the semifinal match of the World Cup.
In July 2011, Allan Donald was drafted into Gary Kirsten's coaching team as bowling coach to the South African cricket team. Kirsten left his post in May 2013, and Russell Domingo was appointed as his replacement. Donald was the bowling coach of South Africa, under head-coach Domingo, he has since been replaced by Charl Langeveldt. Donald is also the coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise in the Indian Premier League.[7]
On 30 April 2017, Sri Lanka hired Donald as bowling consultant for Champions Trophy.[8]Donald said that his endeavour was to play an "inspirational role" and he would be working closely with the squad to assess their individual goals, health condition and personalities. He will work alongside Sri Lanka head coach Graham Ford, a fellow South African,[9]

Career[edit]




A graph showing Donald's test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time.


In 1997 Donald "got involved in an incident that has since caused [him] a lot of grief", Donald was being hit around the park by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in the finals of a one-day series. Donald says he got carried away and confronted Dravid face-to-face saying "This isn't such a fucking easy game". The TV cameras filmed close up shots of the incident, leadiing to accusations that he was a racist.[1]
During the Trent Bridge Test Match of 1998 South Africa batted first, scoring 374 in their first innings. England responded with 336, with Donald taking 5 wickets. In their second innings, South Africa only scored 208 leaving England a target of 247 to win the match. Michael Atherton was at the crease when Donald began a spell of bowling both would later describe in their respective autobiographies as one of the most intense periods of Test Match Cricket they ever played. Donald bowled multiple bouncers to Atherton, but he survived several close chances to remain not out at the end of the day. The next day Atherton along with Alec Stewart were able to score the remaining runs, with Atherton finishing on 98. Several years later, Atherton gave Donald the gloves he wore on this occasion for Donald's benefit year auction.[2]
In the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia Donald was the last batsman on the South African team.[3] Australia batting first making only 213, Donald taking 4–32 and Pollock 5–36. The game swung back and forth with South Africa eventually needing to score 16 runs off the last 8 balls to win with only one wicket remaining. Lance Klusener and Allan Donald were at the crease. Klusner hit a six and then a single to keep the strike, followed by two fours. The scores were level with four balls left in the game. The next ball resulted in no run. Klusner hit the ball after that straight down the ground and set off for a single, but Donald was watching the ball, and missed the call to run. Both batsmen were at the bowler's end before Donald started running, having dropped his bat. The ball was thrown to the bowler, then to Gilchrist, who broke the stumps at the other end, with Donald only halfway down the pitch. Although the match technically ended in a tie, South Africa had previously lost to Australia in the Super-Six phase, and needed to win outright to progress to the final.
Outside International Cricket[edit]
In English county cricket, Donald enjoyed a long and highly successful career with Warwickshire. He also played a single match for Worcestershire in 2002. Having retired from playing, he now commentates for South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) in their coverage of South Africa's home Tests, alongside former teammate Daryll Cullinan. In May 2007, Allan Donald was appointed as a temporary bowling consultant for the England cricket team. His involvement impressed many, and was praised by several players. Donald's original brief contract was extended until September 2007. Donald decided not to continue with his coaching role at the end of September 2007 citing the strain of touring and his wish to be with his family.[4] Donald was a coach at Warwickshire County Cricket Club, and in partnership with fellow coach Ashley Giles helped the county to win the Second Division of the County Championship in 2008.
Allan Donald coached the reigning domestic champions, Mountaineers, (a franchise team) in Zimbabwe [5] and is the bowling coach for the New Zealand cricket team for the ODI series against Pakistan and the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[6] New Zealand team beat South Africa in the semifinal match of the World Cup.
In July 2011, Allan Donald was drafted into Gary Kirsten's coaching team as bowling coach to the South African cricket team. Kirsten left his post in May 2013, and Russell Domingo was appointed as his replacement. Donald was the bowling coach of South Africa, under head-coach Domingo, he has since been replaced by Charl Langeveldt. Donald is also the coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise in the Indian Premier League.[7]
On 30 April 2017, Sri Lanka hired Donald as bowling consultant for Champions Trophy.[8]Donald said that his endeavour was to play an "inspirational role" and he would be working closely with the squad to assess their individual goals, health condition and personalities. He will work alongside Sri Lanka head coach Graham Ford, a fellow South African,[9]

We firmly believe that Exmouth has something special to offer the well travelled angler.   Exmouth is a vast fishery offering first class fly fishing, however areas offering a world class experience are often quite remote and difficult to access and you really require good local knowledge to be successful.   Most clientel are “time poor” and so require/expect their fishing trip to be “hassle free”.   Fly Fishermen generally chase the holistic experience that goes hand-in-hand with fly fishing  so it is our intention to ignite an interest in the local history, fauna/ flora and other places of interest so that all visitors are encouraged to return the next season.   Having our Clients “captivated” during their guiding sessions gives us the perfect opportunity  to “sell the uniqueness” of both Exmouth and Western Australia.   An insight into our new establishment here in Australia. We are proudly a family owned operation.  We are very excited and honoured to have the support of Mayfly tackle, Ross Fly Rods amnd Reels, Bluewater Tackle Exmouth and Tru-Line boats.   We assure you all products are tested and proven of quality by performance out on the water.  Also progressively assisting in any further developments of products from our sponsors.   We respect and appreciate that being a new operator we have a lot to learn and develop in this unique fishery. We firmly believe to fulfil our service; we need to package a product that will succeed.  Being a team effort Mayfly Tackle, Ross Flyrods and reels, Bluewater Tackle Exmouth, Tru-LineBoats and Fly Fishing Frontiers Exmouth, as an outfit we will maximise your time in this exciting frontier.  It is in our best interest to help sustain this unique fishery while at the same time both educating those who utilise our service and providing visitors with the opportunity to enjoy these attractions.  As an operator, we not only optimise your experience, but also contribute to general fisheries management by passing on our expertise and knowledge. In conclusion, fly fishermen are a group of anglers who share a common passion and show great respect for Mother Nature.   They travel the world to appreciate new species, new challenges, new environments and every journey is a unique experience. It is not always about just the fishing ….. it’s also the places the fishing takes them to.   We are able to offer these passionate anglers a professional service which will enhance their “Australian Experience” and unfold to them the beauty and uniqueness of the Exmouth area.   Your Captain - Allan Donald  Allan has loved fishing from earliest childhood memories, first being when his father bought home his first fishing rod.   Clearly developing into a lifelong fixation, Al’s better half seems to think the correct terminology is “Obsession”.   Becoming complacent with conventional techniques of angling, he was introduced to fly fishing. Since experiencing over 12 years , cultivating a great passion and respect for this challenging technique.   He loves to share this Passion and does his upmost to ensure that the client thoroughly enjoys  the experience; if you’re having Fun AL’s having fun.   Boating experience of 18 years with experience skippering both privately owned and commercial vessels here in Exmouth for those who are unfamiliar with the local fishery and waters, Continuous voyages to Montebellos.   Allan has the relevant certifications by completing the required schooling and experience contributing to the safety of all clients, ensuring it as our foremost concern.喜爱的引言还不够文艺，没发现引言你关注的主页MusicJames Abberley (Band Page)BooksGrant's Guide to FishesMoviesFly Fishing Film Tour South Africa电视Saltwater Experience运动员Kelly Norris运动队Frequent Flash其他Fly Fishing Frontiers 、Jon Makim Flies 、 Recreation Travel、Ningaloo Bakehouse & Cafe - Exmouth WA 、 North Coast Surf Traders、Hot Tubs and Saunas 、 Fishing Snowy Mountains、Wilderness Fly Fishing 、 Integra Marine、YETI 、 AFO Hinchinbrook Challenge 2017、Tom Elliott Photo 、 Casting for Recovery Victoria、In the Salt - Fly Fishing Mag 、 Ningaloo Glass Bottom Boat、 Saltwater Flyfishers Sunshine Coast、JC'S Guided Sportfishing 、Chasing Fins- Fly Fishing with James Armstrong 、 Tough Tackle、Gladstone Fly and Sportfishing 、 Float Away Ningaloo、Pike Terror Flies 、The Ascension Bay Lodge 、 Hank Marvin Music Official、Palometa Club 、 Urko Fishing Adventures、Tim Harden Fly 、Fly and Flies 、 Lowrance、YFB At Sea 、EJ Todd Fly Fishing 、 Hooké、The Perth Bathroom Co. 、PLANET FLY FISHING 、 Shark Eyes、WorldCast Anglers 、 X-Stream Fly、h2obonefishing.com 、Ningaloo Training 、 HI Tide Fly Fishing、Fly Odyssey 、TLA sharkfishing 、 Australian Flyfishing Lodge、Flyz Inc 、The Captain 、 Jeff Currier Global Fly Fishing、Beavertail Skiffs 、 30 Reasons、Kimberley IT 、Flats Pirate 、 Beneath the Surface、Dragonfly Boatworks LLC 、Poppa George Sportfishing 、 Focus On The Fly、AFN Fishing & Outdoors 、Estancia Laguna Verde 、 The Mayfly Project、Recfishwest 、 Fly Lords、7even Custom Rods 、Fly fishing Gran Canaria 、 FlyWorld、Mackay Fly & Sportfishing 、 Calder Fly Fishing Association、Garmin Marine 、Westcoast Building Exmouth WA 、 Shipping USA Boats with Freightplus USA、LOOP Fly Festival 、 Estancia Del Zorro Lodge、FishTrack 、Angling Adventures 、 Colour Test、All About Fishing 、Cinco Rios Lodge Chile 、 Ring A Ride - Ningaloo Reef Exmouth WA、Shark Bay Cockles 、Beastmaster Boats 、 International Fly Fishing Film Festival - IF4、Exmouth Heavy Tackle Tournament 、 Douglas J C Leoni、Sharky_shepo 、Suzuki Marine Aust/NZ 、 Blue Media Weddings、NT Flyfishers Social Mob 、Craftsman Angler 、 Puerto Escondido Ride、Glenn Williams - Northside Residential Real Estate 、IGFA 、 MyTotal.TV - English、Inspired 、 April Vokey- FlyGal Ventures、Live Ningaloo 、Fin Focus Research 、 EJ TODD、2 Oceans Tackle 、Aardvark McLeod 、 DLR Building CO Pty Ltd、Black Fly Eyes 、Reaction Lures 、 Fly Fusion、Upper Morwick Fishing, River Coquet 、 Solo Skiff、Photoflyfishing Photoflyfishing 、Bonefish & Tarpon Trust 、 Astove Atoll Fishing、Lecky Leg Australia 、 Active Angling New Zealand、Del Brown Permit Tournament 、FlyLife Magazine 、 Sal Salis Ningaloo Reef、At the riverbend 、 Set The Hook、Fangs and Feathers Wildlife Adventures 、Strip Strike Fly Fishing Club 、 Off the Grid Studios、The Fly Program 、Power-Pole Total Boat Control 、 Cruise Ningaloo、3D Robotics Inc. 、Vision Sportfishing 、 Adipose Boatworks、Angling Frontiers 、 Angler Bear Angling and Fly tying Club、TeamCar 、Salt Fly Hook Up 、 Ningaloo Sportfishing Charters、Exmouth State Emergency Service 、ActivePal 、 Flatsbag Shop、House Of Jasmine 、Smoke & Mirrors Fishing 、 Fat fish Flies、Fly Odyssey Australia 、 Keith Rose-Innes、Portsea Marine  Cargo & Logistics 、Mayfly Tackle 、 Modern Fishing Magazine、Perry Surfboards 、Exmouth, Western Australia 、 Birds Eye View Ningaloo、Rugby World Cup 、The Angling Report 、 Black Orchid Flies、Fly Fish Asia 、 LOOP Adventures、SLPproductions 、Devil in the Bottle 、 WA Marine and Mechanical、Hatch Fly Fishing Crew 、Rock Expeditions 、 Ningaloo Media、Knights Reel Service & Repairs 、Hudson & Loretta Car Hire 、 Winter Custom Yachts、LOOP Sudamérica 、 Diamond Deck、Patagonia Fly Fish 、Marine Ecology Group - Fisheries Research 、 Southern Ocean Sonar Sailing、Reno-Gade Bathrooms 、Beyond Carpentry Contracting 、 Peninsula Flyfishing Club、Barker Boatworks 、Mbtlures Australia 、 Planet Burgers - Exmouth WA、Fly Fishing Nation 、 Western Angler magazine、Fishwrecked Australia 、Capt Jack Productions 、 Forster Fly Muster 2018、Visit Ningaloo - Ningaloo Visitor Centre 、Saltwater Fly Fishers 、 Reefari Fishing Charters、Pesqa.com 、Qlds Best Angler 、 Exmouth Escape Resort - Ningaloo Reef WA、Wild River Fishing Png 、 Weipa sports fishing、Jonathan jones 、Owen River Lodge 、 Flyfishbonehead、Flight Centre Australia 、Sweetwater Fishing Australia 、 Exmouth Caravans - Ningaloo Reef WA、Ocean Active Fly 、Oz Cyclone Chasers 、 BRIAN BROSDAHL PROMOTIONS展开照片+293查看更多照片其他也叫 Allan Donald 的人Allan DonaldDonald Allan MillerDonald Allan FranciaDonald Allan JonesAllan Mac DonaldDonald Allan SmithDonald W.
