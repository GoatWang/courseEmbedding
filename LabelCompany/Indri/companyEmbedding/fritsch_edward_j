Rev. Edward J. Fritsch-Assignment Record




Rev. Edward J. Fritsch 

Summary of Case: Fritsch was accused in a 2002 lawsuit of having sexually abused a ninth grade girl repeatedly in the 1960s. Fritsch had already been sent to treatment by the diocese after his supervising priest at an Appalachian church reported to the bishop that Fritsch had had "contact" with numerous girls. He had also been removed from a parish after a married woman accused him of taking "sexual liberties" with her. He was removed yet again in 1967 when a young woman came forward to report that she was pregnant with his child. Fritsch left the priesthood, married and settled in New Jersey, where he worked at a home for "juvenile delinquents" and for a school board. 

Ordained: 1965

  Source: Official Catholic Directory (New York: P.J. Kenedy and Sons, 1966-1968 )

Priests in a Parish: We use the following 
  convention to show a priest's place among the clergy of a parish: 1/2 means 
  that he is the first priest listed in the Official Catholic Directory (usually 
  the pastor) and that there is a total of two priests at the parish. The shorthand 
  3/4 means that the priest is listed third on a four-priest roster. See our sample 
  page from the Directory.

Note: The Official Catholic Directory aims to report 
  the whereabouts of Catholic priests in the United States on January 1 of the 
  Directory's publication year. Our working assumption is that a priest 
  listed in the Directory for a given year was at the same assignment 
  for part of the previous year as well. However, Kenedy and Sons will sometimes 
  accept updates well into the year of publication. Diocesan clergy records are 
  rarely available to correct this information. The Directory is also 
  sometimes misleading or wrong. We have tried to create an accurate assignment 
  record, given the source materials and their limitations. Assignment records 
  are a work in progress and we are always improving the records that we post. 
  Please email us 
  with new information and corrections.

  This assignment record collates Fritsch's career history as it is represented 
  in the Official Catholic Directory with allegations as reported in the 
  media. We make no representation regarding the truth of the allegation we report, 
  and we remind our readers that the U.S. legal system presumes that a person 
  accused of or charged with a crime is innocent until proven guilty. Similarly, 
  individuals who may be defendants in civil actions are presumed not to be liable 
  for such claims unless a plaintiff proves otherwise. Admissions of guilt or 
  liability are not typically a part of civil or private settlements. For more 
  information, see our posting 
  policy.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
