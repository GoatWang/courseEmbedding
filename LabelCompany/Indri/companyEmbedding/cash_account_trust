Cash Management Trusts
A Cash Management Trust account is an investment product rather than a straightforward bank account so it has a few different characteristics when compared to a cash management account or a savings account.
It is important that investors be aware of the differences so that they can make informed investment choices when they are deciding where to put their cash investment funds. 
Basically, a Cash Management Trust (CMT) is:
a managed investment where the funds of individual unit holders are pooled
the primary investment is in cash securities
the value of each unit does not change, it always remains at $1 
a relatively low risk investment product.
Compare this to a Cash Management Account (CMA).  A CMA is:
a bank account which can only be offered by a regulated banking institution
earns money market interest on cash balances
can also include access via a cheque, credit or debit card facility. 
Investors in a Cash Management Trust will have to receive a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) when they open a trust account and it is worthwhile to read the PDS carefully. Owners of a Cash Management Account should also receive a form of terms and conditions but generally do not have to be provided with a PDS.
Wherever you decide to invest your funds, some points you may want to consider are:
Return of capital – while these investments have a low risk of capital loss, repayment of capital invested in a CMT is not guaranteed.
Withdrawals – because the CMT is a trust the manager can decide to suspend withdrawals when it considers it to be in the best interest of CMT account holders.
Market risk – return on investment is directly affected by changes to the official cash rate as determined by the RBA.
Initial deposit – some CMT and CMA accounts may request that you deposit a minimum amount upon commencement, for example Macquarie Bank’s CMT requires $5,000 initial deposit.  Ordinary savings accounts typically have no or very low minimum deposit requirements.
Minimum operating balance – some accounts require a minimum amount to remain in the account at all times.
Types of Transactions – some CMT accounts may have limitations on the types of transaction that they associate with the account.  For example, some CMT accounts do not have a cheque or debit card facility.
Fees – some CMT accounts may charge management and ongoing fees.
Interest – usually calculated daily but paid monthly.   
Interest rates – CMT accounts generally offer competitive rates of interest, usually better than a savings account. Most CMA accounts offer tiered rates of return depending on account balances.
Underlying investments – the manager of the CMT generally pools the money of individual investors and this is then invested in short dated securities such as government and semi-government securities, bills of exchange, negotiable certificates of deposit, promissory notes, call deposits and other professional money market investments.  As such, it can be a convenient vehicle for the average investor to gain access to the professional money market.
Instrument risk - ensure an understanding of the instruments held by a CMT manager.
Management - consider whether the trust's management has the appropriate skills and experience to manage the investment.
It is up to you as an individual investor to decide which type of account will best suit your needs.

Fidelity Cash Management Account FAQs

















          The Fidelity Cash Management Account is a brokerage account designed for spending and cash management. It is not intended to serve as your main account for securities trading. Customers interested in securities trading should consider a Fidelity Account®.
	
    

          The Cash Balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account is swept to an FDIC-insured account at one or more Program Banks where it earns a variable rate of interest. The deposit at the Program Bank is not covered by SIPC. The deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC website at www.FDIC.gov. As referenced in the FDIC Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosure Document for the Fidelity Cash Management Account, customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. All FDIC insurance coverage is in accordance with FDIC rules. See the list of eligible Program Banks.
	
    

          1. All Fidelity ATM withdrawal fees will be waived for your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. In addition, your account will automatically be reimbursed for all ATM fees charged by other institutions while using a Fidelity® Visa® Gold Check Card linked to your account at any ATM displaying the Visa®, Plus®, or Star® logos. The reimbursement will be credited to the account the same day the ATM fee is debited from the account. Please note, there is a foreign transaction fee of one percent that is not waived, which will be included in the amount charged to your account. The Fidelity® Visa® Gold Check Card is issued by PNC Bank, N.A. and the check card program is administered by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company. Those entities are not affiliated with each other or with Fidelity Investments. Visa is a registered trademark of Visa International Service Association, and is used by PNC Bank pursuant to license from Visa U.S.A. Inc.
	
    

          2. The Fidelity® Cash Management Account's uninvested cash balance is swept to one or more program banks where it earns a variable rate of interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. At a minimum, there are five banks available to accept these deposits, making customers eligible for nearly $1,250,000 of FDIC insurance. If the number of available banks changes, or you elect not to use, and/or have existing assets at, one or more of the available banks, the actual amount could be higher or lower. For more information on FDIC insurance coverage, please visit www.FDIC.gov. Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance coverage in accordance with FDIC rules. Refer to the FDIC-Insured Cash (Core) Disclosure Statement and list of eligible Program Banks for details. The deposits at Program Banks are not covered by SIPC.

Ready to get started?



You're only three easy steps from moving your checking account to a Fidelity Cash Management Account.
















          The Fidelity® Cash Management Account is a brokerage account designed for spending and cash management. It is not intended to serve as your main account for securities trading. Customers interested in securities trading should consider a Fidelity Account®.
	
    

Fidelity is not a bank and brokerage accounts are not FDIC-insured, but uninvested cash balances are eligible for FDIC insurance.


          1. All Fidelity ATM withdrawal fees will be waived for your Fidelity Cash Management Account. In addition, your account will automatically be reimbursed for all ATM fees charged by other institutions while using a Fidelity Visa® Gold Check Card linked to your account, at any ATM displaying the Visa®, Plus® or Star® logos. The reimbursement will be credited to your Fidelity Cash Management Account the same day the ATM fee is debited from the account. Please note, there is a foreign transaction fee of one percent that is not waived, which will be included in the amount charged to your account. The Fidelity Visa® Gold Check Card is issued by PNC Bank, NA and administered by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments. The third-party trademarks appearing herein are the property of their respective owners.
	
    

          2. The Cash Balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account is swept to an FDIC-insured interest bearing account at a Program Bank. The deposit at the Program Bank is not covered by SIPC. The deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. All assets of the account holder at the depository institution will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC website at FDIC.gov or call 877-ASK-FDIC. As referenced in the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosure Document for the Fidelity Cash Management Account, customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at the Program Bank to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. All FDIC insurance coverage is in accordance with FDIC rules. Go to Fidelity.com/FCMACoreBanks to see a list of eligible Program Banks, and the FDIC Disclosure Document.
	
    

          3. You will earn 2 points per dollar in eligible net purchases (purchases minus credits and returns) that you charge. Account must be open and in good standing to earn and redeem rewards and benefits. The 2% rewards value applies only to points redeemed for a deposit into an eligible Fidelity account. The redemption value is different if you choose to redeem your points for other rewards. Other restrictions apply.
	
    

          4. Eligible accounts include most nonretirement registrations as well as Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, Rollover IRA, SEP IRA, Fidelity Charitable® Giving Account®, and Fidelity-managed 529 College Savings Plan accounts. The ability to contribute to an IRA or 529 college savings plan account is subject to IRS rules and specific program policies, including those on eligibility and annual and maximum contribution limits. Full details appear in the Program Guidelines new card customers receive with their card. Contributions to Fidelity Charitable® are generally eligible for a federal income tax charitable deduction. Please consult with your tax advisor. The list of eligible registration types may change without notice at Fidelity's sole discretion. For more information about whether a particular registration is eligible, please call 1-800-FIDELITY.
	
    

          All customer ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntary basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the website (after a delay for screening against guidelines) and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.
	
    

          The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and is not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating and review.
	
    

          Please contact a Fidelity representative if you have additional questions or concerns about the ratings and reviews posted here.
	
    

          Fidelity Charitable® is the brand name for the Fidelity Investments® Charitable Gift Fund, an independent public charity with a donor-advised fund program. Various Fidelity companies provide services to Fidelity Charitable. The Fidelity Charitable name and logo and Fidelity are registered service marks of FMR LLC, used by Fidelity Charitable under license. "Giving Account" is a registered service mark of the Trustees of Fidelity Charitable.
	
    

          The creditor and issuer of the Fidelity® Rewards Visa Signature® Card is Elan Financial Services, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc.
	
    

          Elan and Fidelity are not affiliated, and Fidelity is not responsible for the content contained herein.
	
    

          Fidelity and Elan Financial Services are separate companies.

Cash Management Account Definition - What is a Cash Management Account? Available languagesGreekItalianSpanishGermanFrenchChineseArabicIndonesianJapaneseRussianPortuguese AboutWorld RatesLiveSign InWorldDictionaryCash Management AccountWorldUnited StatesLogin / SignupallSettingsFollowingLogoutCash Management AccountCash Management Account Meaning:In deposit terminology, the term Cash Management Account refers to a type of account offered by brokerage companies and other financial institutions.This type of account combines a brokerage account with a checking account. Cash Management Account Example:For example, a Cash Management Account will often allow a customer to buy and sell stocks, options, bonds and commodities, while at the same time allowing them to earn money market interest on cash balances. In addition, the Cash Management Account acts as a checking account by allowing the account holder to write checks against cash balances. Many of these accounts also include access via a credit or debit card whereby cash funds are made readily available to account holders. A hefty minimum deposit is generally required to open a Cash Management Account, although the advantages that these accounts offer wealthier and more active investors that manage their own portfolios tend to outweigh the disadvantages.

Case study - easy online application for Macquarie CMA






       The adviser and client were both pleasantly surprised when they received notification in hours rather than days that the application had been approved.
    



 

Challenge


       An advised client in Adelaide wished to set up a Macquarie CMA, so she called her financial adviser to ask for help.
    

       Based on experience with setting up similar accounts with a number of different financial institutions, the adviser expected the application process would take some time and effort.
    



Process


       The adviser logged in to his Macquarie Access portal and completed the online application. An account number was generated in real time and the client was sent a personalised email that prompted her to authorise the application online.
    

       Electronic verification was then performed immediately on the client’s details.
    

       Next, the account was processed by Macquarie and moved to ‘open’ status.
    

       At any moment and in real time, the adviser could track the status of the application through Macquarie Access.
    



Outcome


       The adviser and client were both pleasantly surprised when they received notification in hours rather than days that the application had been approved and the account was open. The process had been simpler, faster and more convenient than either imagined.
    

       This was great news for the client. She saved time and didn’t have to travel to the adviser’s office for lengthy application-signing session.
    

       It was also beneficial to the adviser, as it enabled him to progress quickly to the many other important business tasks on his list. In addition, the ease and speed of the process greatly enhanced his relationship with his client.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
