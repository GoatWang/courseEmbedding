What exactly is a registered agent (AKA resident agent, statutory agent or corporate agent), and why would I need one?


                        A registered agent is a person or entity, designated in the articles of incorporation / organization, who can accept legal documents and notifications from a state office on behalf of a corporate entity.
                     All corporations and Limited-Liability Companies (LLCs) must choose a person or entity to act as their registered agent. There are few restrictions regarding who can be a registered agent other than that the person or
                    entity must be located and available at a physical street address within the state during normal business hours. It is important that you select a reliable company when choosing your registered agent.
                
Perhaps you've heard that you can act as your own registered agent... Not a good idea!

                    If you act as your own agent, you don't have the flexibility to close your office or have flexible hours since you must always be open to accept service of process (SOP). Additionally, having a registered agent saves you from
                    potentially being served with legal papers in front of your family, clients, neighbors or vendors. Lastly, you will appreciate having a professional registered agent service to track and notify you of annual reports being due and
                    other filings that you may have to periodically file.
                

                    Remember: If your Registered Agent is not reliable, you could lose your corporate or Limited-Liability Company status and have to pay considerable penalties. This is why national registered agent services is InCorp's primary
                    business!

WASHINGTON, June 9, 2017 – CC Kitchens, LLC, a Cincinnati, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 2,415 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry salad products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The ready-to-eat meat and poultry salad items were produced and packaged on various dates between May 31, 2017 and June 5, 2017. The salad products have a six-day shelf life. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

12.6-oz. clamshell packages containing “Chef Salad” with case code 71001 and “Sell By” dates of 6/5/2017, 6/6/2017, 6/7/2017, 6/8/2017, 6/9/2017 and 6/10/2017.
13.1-oz. clamshell packages containing “Chicken & Bacon Cobb Salad” with case code 71004 and “Sell By” dates of 6/5/2017, 6/6/2017, 6/7/2017, 6/8/2017, 6/9/2017 and 6/10/2017.
9.4-oz. clamshell packages containing “Chef Side Salad” with case code 71005 and “Sell By” dates of 6/5/2017, 6/6/2017, 6/7/2017, 6/8/2017, 6/9/2017 and 6/10/2017.
9.65-oz. clamshell packages containing “Chicken & Bacon Cobb Side Salad” with case code 71007 and “Sell By” dates of 6/5/2017, 6/6/2017, 6/7/2017, 6/8/2017, 6/9/2017 and 6/10/2017.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. P-45676” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia.
The problem was discovered when CC Kitchens, LLC was notified by one of its suppliers that lettuce used in the production of their ready-to-eat meat and poultry salad products was involved in a recall. The lettuce supplier initiated a recall as a precaution because positive test results for the presence of Listeria (which could include L. monocytogenes) were identified during environmental testing of portions of their facility. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.
Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.
Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.
Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
Members of the media with questions regarding the recall can contact Melissa Wideman, CC Kitchens, LLC Vice President of Community Relations, at (513) 817-5144. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can call CC Kitchens, LLC  24-Hour Consumer Hotline at (866) 458-3188.
Consumers with food safety questions can "Ask Karen," the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. The online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/reportproblem.

 Retail Distribution Lists
FSIS has reason to believe that the retail locations listed received the recalled meat or poultry products described in the news release.
Lists may not include all retail locations that have received the recalled product or may include retail locations that did not actually receive the recalled product. Therefore, it is important that you use the product-specific identification information in the news release, in addition to this list of retail stores, to check meat or poultry products in your possession to see if they have been recalled.
For large volume recalls, it may take several days to assemble the initial list. Lists may be updated as additional information becomes available.
"No retail sales" indicates that no retailers were identified for the recall in question. For example, the product may have gone exclusively to restaurants and institutions, and in this case there would be no retailers in the distribution chain.
Finally, FSIS will provide lists when retail sales are associated with a Class I recall. There will be no distribution lists associated with Class II or Class III recalls.

What exactly is a registered agent (AKA resident agent, statutory agent or corporate agent), and why would I need one?


                        A registered agent is a person or entity, designated in the articles of incorporation / organization, who can accept legal documents and notifications from a state office on behalf of a corporate entity.
                     All corporations and Limited-Liability Companies (LLCs) must choose a person or entity to act as their registered agent. There are few restrictions regarding who can be a registered agent other than that the person or
                    entity must be located and available at a physical street address within the state during normal business hours. It is important that you select a reliable company when choosing your registered agent.
                
Perhaps you've heard that you can act as your own registered agent... Not a good idea!

                    If you act as your own agent, you don't have the flexibility to close your office or have flexible hours since you must always be open to accept service of process (SOP). Additionally, having a registered agent saves you from
                    potentially being served with legal papers in front of your family, clients, neighbors or vendors. Lastly, you will appreciate having a professional registered agent service to track and notify you of annual reports being due and
                    other filings that you may have to periodically file.
                

                    Remember: If your Registered Agent is not reliable, you could lose your corporate or Limited-Liability Company status and have to pay considerable penalties. This is why national registered agent services is InCorp's primary
                    business!
