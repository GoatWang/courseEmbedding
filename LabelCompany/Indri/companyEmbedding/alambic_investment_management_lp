Methodology - Alambic Investment Management. L.P
























































Methodology

















 Investment Philosophy
Alambic’s investment philosophy reflects the belief that behavioral biases and information asymmetries create small, predictable deviations in individual stock prices from fair value.  Through back testing historical data, we have found that these biases are persistent and create investment opportunities that can be profitably harvested through a systematic process.

 Systematic Process

Alambic’s stock selection process systematically identifies opportunities based on valuation, quality and growth factors.  Our proprietary factors were derived from decades of equity research experience and subjected to rigorous statistical and historical testing.  Our models forecast future returns of every stock in our investible universe. These forecasted returns along with estimates of trading costs are then used as inputs into our proprietary portfolio optimizer which designs optimal portfolios that conform to specified risk tolerances.

Team - Alambic Investment Management. L.P

































































Team









Our ten-person team has deep backgrounds in equity-research, engineering, statistics and management. Seven have engineering degrees, eight have lived in the mid-west, four came from Citi/Saloman, three are MIT alumni, three have chemical engineering degrees and two were raised on farms (we are numbers people).

Albert Richards
PhD, CFA | CEO and Partner
Albert Richards is a 20-year veteran of the financial services industry. Before starting Alambic Investment Management to develop systematic stock selection strategies, he perfected the art of tearing apart financial statements to find value and opportunity. As a sell-side analyst and head of research within two large global investment banks, Bert became adept at identifying and quantifying the key drivers of equity valuation and company quality as well as the behavioral pitfalls that create market opportunities.
As Alambic’s primary strategy architect, Bert brings his insight in equity research to the development of innovative stock selection models and his management expertise to the leadership of the firm.
Prior to becoming a founding partner of Alambic, Bert was Managing Director and Head of European Equity Research (1994-2000) for Citigroup (previously Salomon Brothers), European Internet and Global Technology strategist (2000-2003) and Small and Mid-Cap strategist (2003-2006). From 1986 to 1994 Mr. Richards worked in equity research for Credit Suisse First Boston in New York and London.
Mr. Richards received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1981, an M.S. in Chemical Engineering from MIT in 1983, a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from MIT in 1986, and an M.B.A. from the Sloan School of Management (MIT), also in 1986. He was awarded the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation in 1990.

Brian Thompson
PhD, CAIA | CRO and Partner
Brian Thompson is Alambic’s President and Chief Risk Officer. A perpetual academic, Brian routinely immerses himself in novel areas of study and pursues them to mastery.  He is adept at relating complex concepts to the uninitiated and his multi-disciplinary background allows him to find insights inaccessible to others.  While pursuing his PhD at MIT, Brian completed a concentration in statistics and was a tenured professor before pursing a career in industry. He began his research in finance by deriving the Black-Scholes Model for derivative pricing and modeling the demand-driven mispricing of pari-mutuel betting spreads.  An accomplished oboist, Brian finds symmetry between music and quantitative finance, as excellence in both disciplines is found at the intersection of predictable rhythm and emotion.
From 1998 to 2002, Mr. Thompson was a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff and then Senior Member of Technical Staff at Lucent Technologies, Agere Systems and Legerity, Inc., successively. For the 10 years prior to 1998, he was a Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Kansas (tenured in 1993), and, from 1986 to 1988, he was a Member of Technical Staff at Analog Devices.
Mr. Thompson received his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Kansas in 1981, an M.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983, and a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering, with a minor in Statistics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986. He was awarded the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) designation in 2008.

Robert T. Slaymaker
Partner

Robert Slaymaker was an early advisor and eschewed retirement to join the firm in 2013.  The unparalleled depth and breadth of Rob’s experience in financial services, benefits Alambic’s management, strategy and development.
Prior to joining Alambic, Rob was an Operating Partner with Advent International, Inc., advising on the potential acquisition of global financial technology companies. Between 2004 and 2008, Mr. Slaymaker was the CEO of BondDesk Group LLC., an electronic bond trading platform that provides decision support, live market execution and straight through processing to financial advisors. From 1998 to 2004, Mr. Slaymaker was the COO of the Equity Division of Bank of America Securities (formerly Montgomery Securities) and Chairman of BancAmerica Securities and head of Fixed Income from 1993 to 1998. He held a series of fixed income sales and trading management roles in the US and Asia while working in Bank of America’s securities division prior to 1993. Mr. Slaymaker is currently on the Board of Directors of Cetip S.A. in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Mr. Slaymaker received a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University in 1974.

Mike Oberhaus
COO/CFO and Founder
Michael Oberhaus is Alambic’s CFO and COO. Mike and Bert were colleagues at Citigroup from 2003 to 2006 and Mike was among the founders of Alambic Investment Management.   Mike joined the firm as a Quantitative Strategist and recognized his affinity for operations as the firm’s operations requirements grew.  As a trained engineer, Mike thrives streamlining and automating processes and others have remarked that thanks to his discipline (and mastery of VBA/SQL), Mike can accomplish the work of at least 3 people in a single day.  From 1999 to 2003, he was an R&D Engineer in the Transfusion Therapies division of Baxter Healthcare Corporation in Chicago.  Mr. Oberhaus received his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Iowa State University in 2002.

Scott McBride
CFA | Quantitative Strategist and Founder

Scott McBride is a Quantitative Strategist.  Scott put his Electrical Engineering degree to work in Hardware Equity Research for seven years before joining Alambic as a Founder and Lead Computer Geek.
Prior to joining Alambic in early 2007, Mr. McBride was an Associate Analyst on the Hardware Equity Research Team at Schwab Soundview/Soundview Technology Group. From 2000 to 2003, he worked for Citigroup/Salomon Smith Barney in Hardware Equity Research and Global Technology Strategy. Before that, Mr. McBride was Communication Systems Engineer at TRW, where he was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff.
Mr. McBride received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Arizona in 1989, an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991, and an M.B.A degree from the Anderson School of Management (UCLA) in 1998. He was awarded the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation in 2003.

Mary Phillips
Chief Compliance Officer

Mary Phillips is Alambic’s Chief Compliance Officer and joined the firm in 2009.  Bert and Mary worked together at Salomon Brothers in London before they both, coincidentally, settled in the Bay Area.  From 2003 to 2009, Ms. Phillips performed human resources and administrative support for NaturalPath Media and Lark Media, Inc. Before that, Ms. Phillips was Executive Vice President and Counsel in the European Compliance Department for Citigroup (formerly Salomon Brothers) in London, England; Senior Counsel and Branch Chief in the Division of Enforcement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in Washington, D.C.; and Associate at Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, in Washington, D.C.  Ms. Phillips received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1986 and a J.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1989.

Prior to joining Alambic in 2013, Ms. Lawson was the Head of Quant Strategy for Thomson Reuters and a member of the Quantitative Research Team at StarMine (acquired by Thomson Reuters in 2008). Before that, she was an IT consultant and the Head of Operations and Client Services for a technology start-up.

Matthew Dolan

Alambic History
Albert Richards and Brian Thomson were assigned to the same office space on their first day in the Chemical Engineering PhD program at MIT.   Twenty-five years later, they again, moved into the same office (in Bert’s home) to start Alambic Investment Management.  Mike Oberhaus and Scott McBride, who worked with Bert at Citigroup, rounded out the founding team and after a few months of coding, the team moved to office space in San Francisco’s Financial District.
The team spent the first three years building the data management, returns estimation and portfolio optimization platform that drives Alambic’s strategies. Before launching their first product to outside investors, the team used the strategy to trade a personal account at Interactive Brokers.
Since 2013, the firm has scaled from $12m to over $350m in assets under management and continues to add capabilities and products to its offerings.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Astec Industries (NASDAQ:ASTE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $73.00 (43.36% upside)
