    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH

1784 Capital Holdings to Develop Self-Storage Facility in Scottsdale, AZ

1784 Capital Holdings LLC intends to develop a self-storage facility on 2.52 acres in Scottsdale, Ariz. The company acquired the property at 7550 E. Paradise Lane for about $1.15 million. It’s within the master-planned Scottsdale Promenade development, which includes and is adjacent to high-end multi-family housing, office buildings, resorts and retail. The company plans to break ground on Scottsdale Promenade Self Storage this summer, according to a press release.





 








“We chose the Promenade location because of its impressive demographics and extraordinary fundamentals,” said Shane Albers, chairman and CEO. “The coveted North Scottsdale market is undersupplied with self-storage and faces significant barriers to entry. The market attracts strong rents that are twice the national average. New residential development and prime retail centers within the area solidify the appeal of developing this project within Scottsdale Promenade.” 
The building site is near the major thoroughfares of Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard and Scottsdale Road. 1784 Capital also has a project underway in the Phoenix suburb of Ahwatukee and indicated it’s actively looking for other opportunities in the area. It has allocated $250 million to expand its national portfolio, the release stated, and recently announced a project in Bethesda, Md. Executive vice president Kelly McKone is leading the company’s expansion plan.
The Scottsdale deal was brokered by Denise Nunez, senior vice president of NAI Horizon, a full-service commercial real estate brokerage and management firm. NAI Horizon is a member of NAI Global, a managed network of independently owned commercial real estate brokerage firms. The company assists corporations with negotiating leases, sales, business brokerage, investments, relocation, site selection and development.
Founded in 2013 and based in Scottsdale, 1784 Capital acquires, develops, constructs and owns self-storage facilities. Its subsidiary, 1784 Solar LLC, provides short-term construction financing for solar projects in Canada and the United States.

1784 Capital Holdings LLC has begun construction of Tucson Orange Grove Self Storage in Tucson, Ariz. The 2.81-acre property at 121 W. Orange Grove was purchased as two vacant lots from Orange Grove/Oracle LLC and 4-D Properties LLP, according to a press release. 





 








The two-story facility is expected to open during the second quarter. It will comprise 73,250 square feet of storage space in 532 units. Both levels will be accessible by vehicle. 
“This property is at the western edge of the [Santa] Catalina Mountains and is an ideal location for the growing community of self-storage users,” said Shane Albers, CEO and chairman. “We are committed to the Tucson marketplace, and look forward to expanding within the city.”
1784 Capital has allocated $250 million to expand its national storage portfolio, the release stated. Kelly McKone, executive vice president, is directing the effort. 
Earlier this month, the company acquired 2.52 acres of land in Scottsdale, Ariz., to build a storage facility. The property is within the master-planned Scottsdale Promenade development, which includes and is adjacent to high-end multi-family housing, office buildings, resorts and retail. The company plans to break ground on Scottsdale Promenade Self Storage this summer.
The Tucson land purchase was negotiated by Denise Nunez, senior vice president of NAI Horizon, a Phoenix-based commercial real estate brokerage and management firm. A member of NAI Global, the organization is a managed network of independently owned commercial real estate brokerage firms. It assists corporations with negotiating leases, sales, business brokerage, investments, relocation, site selection and development.
Founded in 2013 and based in Scottsdale, 1784 Capital acquires, develops, constructs and owns self-storage facilities. Its subsidiary, 1784 Solar LLC, provides short-term construction financing for solar projects in Canada and the United States.

    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
