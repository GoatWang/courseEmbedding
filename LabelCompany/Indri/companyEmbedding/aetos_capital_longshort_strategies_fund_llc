	 1 Allocations are subject to change over time and exclude cash.2 Performance figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2016 of the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio and are net of an investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return, respectively. The performance figures shown may include returns that are preliminary, unaudited, and estimated based on the most recent information provided by underlying fund managers, and are subject to change. For performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an investor redeems each December 31 and invests each January 1. Aetos Capital formalized the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio in April 2007. The performance figures shown for periods prior to April 2007 are those of the Aetos Capital Funds comprising the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio, weighted according to the allocations on April 1, 2007. During the period from September 2002 through April 2007, it is likely that the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio allocations to the Aetos Capital Funds would have differed from the allocations on April 1, 2007, and the performance shown is not necessarily representative of the performance that would have been achieved had the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio been in existence during the entire period. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

The Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio is a model portfolio/asset allocation program. This Portfolio may not reflect an investor’s actual portfolio as actual portfolios reflect each investor’s own objectives and risk tolerances. The performance of the Portfolio is based on the weighted performance over the respective periods of the Aetos Capital SEC-Registered Funds, weighted according to the allocations in effect during the periods. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

�1�Allocations
are subject to change over time.
�2�Performance
figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through February 28, 2010 are
of the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio and are net of an investment advisory fee
of 0.75% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury
bill return, respectively.�For
performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an�investor
redeems each December 31 and invests each February 1. Aetos Capital formalized
the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio in April 2007.�The
performance figures shown for periods prior to April 2007 are those of the Aetos
Capital Funds comprising the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio, weighted according
to the allocations on April 1, 2007.�For
periods prior to the inception of the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund in August
2005, the weightings to the three Aetos Capital Funds then in existence are
increased pro rata.�During
the period from September 2002 through April 2007, it is likely that the Aetos
Capital Prime Portfolio allocations to the Aetos Capital Funds would
have�differed
from the allocations today, and the performance shown is not necessarily
representative of the performance that would have been achieved had the Aetos
Capital Prime Portfolio been in existence during the entire period. The returns
also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or
reimbursed by the Investment�Adviser.�Returns
would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.
�Absolute
return investing involves substantial risks, including the risk of loss of
invested capital.� Absolute return investments are typically made through
investments in illiquid, unregulated investment funds that employ sophisticated
investment techniques, often involving derivatives and leverage, in a wide range
of financial instruments and�markets.��These
investments entail a wide variety of risks, which remain substantial
notwithstanding the risk management practices we employ in�selecting and
monitoring funds we invest in.�(Profile B)
�Prospective
investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and the charges and
expenses discussed above carefully before investing.�The
prospectus contains this and other information; a free copy of the prospectus
may be obtained by calling 212-201-2540.�Please
read the prospectus carefully before investing.

WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund


                                    DYB is able to be net short or market neutral when the market environment 
                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes. 
 
Index Valuations

For definitions of terms and indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
 
•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
