AVEO Oncology (AVEO) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutics for oncology and other areas of unmet medical need. The Company is focused on seeking to develop and commercialize its lead candidate tivozanib, a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2 and 3 receptors, in North America as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma. AVEO is leveraging multiple partnerships aimed at developing and commercializing tivozanib in oncology indications outside of North America, and progressing its pipeline of novel therapeutic candidates in cancer, cachexia (wasting syndrome) and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
On June 23, 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), recommended FOTIVDA™ (tivozanib) for approval as a treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The CHMP’s recommendation is now referred to the European Commission (EC) for a final decision regarding marketing authorization.

AVEO Pharma surges 48% on recommendation for European approval of its cancer drug
AVEO Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares surged as much as 48% in extremely heavy morning trade Friday after the company's cancer drug was recommended for approval in Europe. The decision was made by a scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency and will be considered by the European Commission, with a decision expected in about 67 days, the company said. The drug, tivozanib, is being licensed in Europe by EUSA Pharma Inc. Tivozanib is intended for advanced renal cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of kidney cancer and is expected to be one of the fastest growing cancers in the next decade. AVEO failed to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for tivozanib back in 2013. The company has an ongoing phase 3 trial in third-line renal cell carcinoma, which is expected to read out in the first quarter of 2018. European approval of tivozanib would "add significant resources to our balance sheet as we work toward the anticipated readout," AVEO Chief Executive Michael Bailey said, including a $4 million research and development reimbursement payment and up to $12 million in additional milestone payments from EUSA Pharma. AVEO shares have surged 51.1% over the last three months to $1.08 per share, compared with a 3.7% rise in the S&P 500 .

AVEO Pharma surges 48% on recommendation for European approval of its cancer drug
AVEO Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares surged as much as 48% in extremely heavy morning trade Friday after the company's cancer drug was recommended for approval in Europe. The decision was made by a scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency and will be considered by the European Commission, with a decision expected in about 67 days, the company said. The drug, tivozanib, is being licensed in Europe by EUSA Pharma Inc. Tivozanib is intended for advanced renal cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of kidney cancer and is expected to be one of the fastest growing cancers in the next decade. AVEO failed to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for tivozanib back in 2013. The company has an ongoing phase 3 trial in third-line renal cell carcinoma, which is expected to read out in the first quarter of 2018. European approval of tivozanib would "add significant resources to our balance sheet as we work toward the anticipated readout," AVEO Chief Executive Michael Bailey said, including a $4 million research and development reimbursement payment and up to $12 million in additional milestone payments from EUSA Pharma. AVEO shares have surged 51.1% over the last three months to $1.08 per share, compared with a 3.7% rise in the S&P 500 .
