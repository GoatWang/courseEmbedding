Bill’s By the Number$Posted by: Vanessa Guadiana | Posted on: August 25th, 2014 | 0 Comments
WHAT IF? – The longest bull market for the S&P 500 since 1950 lasted 9 ½ years (actually 2,388 trading days).  The current bull market (which began on 3/09/09) has lasted 1,375 trading days (through Friday 8/22/14), or 1,013 trading days short of the longest bull since 1950.  During the final 1,013 trading days of its 9 ½ year bull run, the S&P 500 gained +135%, i.e., change of the raw index not including the impact of reinvested dividends.  The S&P 500 consists of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity and industry group representation.  It is a market value weighted index with each stock’s weight in the index proportionate to its market value (source: BTN Research).
HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER? – With 5 trading days remaining in August, the S&P 500 is up +3.9% (total return) for the 3 summer months of June-July-August (source: BTN Research).
A YEAR LATER – The S&P 500 has gained at least +5% in a single trading day 17 times since 1950, most recently on 3/23/09.  In the 1 year following the 17 occurrences of “5% or more” gains, the S&P 500 gained an average of +20.2% not counting the impact of reinvested dividends (source: BTN Research).
BEHIND THE NUMBERS – In June 2014, 4.547 million Americans left their jobs (aka “separations”) either voluntarily (i.e., they quit), involuntarily (i.e., layoffs), or as a result of other circumstances (e.g., retirement, death, disability).  In June 2014, 4.830 million Americans were hired.  Because “hires” exceeded “separations,” employment rose by +283,000 during the month (source: Department of Labor).
RISK OF RISING RATES – The average interest rate paid by the government on its interest bearing debt was 2.402% as of 7/31/14.  The average interest rate paid by the government on its interest bearing debt was 4.382% as of 7/31/08 (6 years earlier), equal to 2% greater than today.  Every 1% increase in the cost of debt on our nation’s $17.7 trillion debt total is equal to $177 billion per year in interest expense (source: Treasury Department).
DISABILITY PROGRAM – The number of Americans receiving disability payments through Social Security has increased from 2.9 million in 1980 to 11.0 million in 2013.  Congress expanded in 1984 (i.e., 30 years ago) the ways in which Americans could qualify for disability benefits, shifting from a list of specific injuries to a more general review of a individual’s capacity to work (source: Social Security).
THE AMERICAN DREAM – If you are an average American, then 70% of your total consumer indebtedness is mortgage debt (source: New York Federal Reserve).
BORROWING MONEY – 31% of Americans have applied for some form of credit in the prior 12 months, including auto loans, home mortgages, and credit card debt (source: Federal Reserve).
EARNING TWICE AS MUCH IN THE USA – Bond buyers in the 18-countries that make up the Eurozone (i.e., the countries that use the Euro as their common currency) could invest in the 10-year German Bund (0.98% yield as of 8/22/14 Friday) or in the US 10-year Treasury note (2.40% yield as of 8/22/14 Friday).  Germany is the largest economy in the Eurozone and # 4 in the world (source: BTN Research).
WAS IT WORTH IT? – 56% of employees surveyed believe that if they had a higher level of education then they would be more successful in their employment career.  However 48% of college graduates with jobs today do not believe their degree is relevant to the work they are doing today (source: Glassdoor).
WHERE IT COMES FROM – 23 of 50 US states collect more money in the form of state sales tax revenue than they collect in personal income tax revenue.  5 states do not have any statewide sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon (source: Rockefeller Institute of Government).
NOT LIKELY – Janet Yellen has been on the job as Federal Reserve chair for just 6 ½ months.  If Yellen ultimately served as Fed Chair for the same length of time that Alan Greenspan did (i.e., 18 ½ years), then Yellen would be in office until the summer of the year 2032 or just short of her 86th birthday (source: Federal Reserve).
VARIES – The average price of an existing home sold in the USA has increased just +4% over the last 12 months (i.e., 6/30/13 to 6/30/14).  Home prices have increased +7% in the 13-states in the West and have been flat (i.e., no increase or decrease) in the 9-states in the Northeast (source: National Association of Realtors).
I’M BIGGER THAN YOU – Outstanding student loans were $1.12 trillion and outstanding credit card debt was $873 billion as of 6/30/14, a difference of nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars (source: Federal Reserve).
STATE EMPLOYEE – In 39 of 50 US states, the highest paid state employee is a college basket coach or a college football coach (source: The Economist).

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities


Synergy Partners has joined forces with one of the largest factoring operations in the United States, converting over 500 companies’ accounts receivable into cash daily. Historical purchases up to $1 billion annually. This joint venture will allow Synergy Partners to offer yet another product to financial institutions to achieve growth through new accounts, non-interest income, higher profitability, and increased retention.
Benefits of Factoring
Generates immediate cash from operations.
No restrictive financial covenants.
Often an alternative for clients that might otherwise sell equity or seek partners.
Clients utilize full benefit of our credit department at no additional cost.
Allows clients to take advantage of purchase discounts.
De-leveraging effect.
Our Competitive Advantage
Our fees and rates are typically much lower than other factoring companies (often more than 50%lower) in the industry.
Our policies and procedures are under constant scrutiny by regulatory agencies resulting in a more professional approach with customers than some competitors employ in the factoring industry.
Debtors can continue making payments to the name of your bank.
We do not compete for any banking business. Non-compete language is included in the formal referral agreement.
All notification to debtors is presented on your bank’s letterhead.
The referral partner has the ability to win ancillary bank services and a long-term relationship with prospective customers that would otherwise not qualify for traditional bank financing.
We offer flexible contract terms (90-days to 12-months).
Our pricing is calculated from funding date vs. invoice date (many competitors charge from invoice date).
We allow the customer to factor as needed. The customer does not have to factor every invoice. We do not have minimum requirements or unused fees.
We will waive wire fees if the company referred maintains a depository relationship with the referral source.
We will waive the early exit penalty should the company be approved for a traditional loan with the referring bank
