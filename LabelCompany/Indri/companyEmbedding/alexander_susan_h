Prior to that, Ms. Alexander was a partner at the law firms of Hinckley, Allen & Snyder and Fine & Ambrogne. 
QUALIFICATIONS
The Board concluded that Ms. Alexander should serve as a Director of the Company primarily due to her experience in the bio- and med-tech industries gained through her legal leadership roles in Biogen and PAREXEL International. Ms. Alexander has a broad range of corporate legal experience both from private law and general counsel positions in global med-tech, software and manufacturing companies and will bring strong cross-functional legal, regulatory and senior management expertise to the Board. The Board believes that Ms. Alexander's background and experience will be valuable in contributing to the Board's oversight of the Company's regulatory and compliance functions, particularly as the Company seeks to continue the transformation of its business and drive toward more clinically complex solutions in the health care industry.
