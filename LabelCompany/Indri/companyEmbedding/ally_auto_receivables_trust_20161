                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1
    





January 27, 2016 11:37 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 as follows:
    

      --$200,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$236,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$140,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$321,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$98,300,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,140,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,450,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$13,710,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The 2016-1 collateral is comparable to that 
      of the last three transactions. While these more recent pools have seen 
      a decline in weighted-average (WA) FICO scores and marginally higher 
      annual percentage rates (APRs), there have been positive shifts such as 
      lower loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), stable new vehicle concentration, and 
      decrease in longer term loans.
    

      Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is unchanged 
      from the prior four transactions, with 5.85% in hard CE for the class A 
      notes. Excess spread per annum is 2.20%, consistent with the 2015-2 (NR) 
      transaction and down 0.05% from the rated 2014-3 transaction.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Ally's 2009-2015 portfolio 
      and securitization delinquencies and losses continue to perform well and 
      remain at low historical levels through 3Q15.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch currently rates 
      Ally Financial 'BB+' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Ally demonstrates 
      solid capabilities as an originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by its historical portfolio and securitization performance. 
      Fitch deems Ally capable of adequately servicing 2016-1.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Vehicle Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market 
      (WVM) is normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch 
      expects increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and 
      trade-ins to pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher 
      loss severity. Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including 
      periods of weak WVM performance in the derivation of its base case loss 
      expectation.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 
      2016-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased 
      defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the 
      class A notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The 
      notes could experience a downgrade of one or more rating categories 
      under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      presale report published Jan. 6, 2016 and available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 202 loans 
      from the computer generated automobile loan data file. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an 
      impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 -- 
      Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset 
      class as detailed in Fitch's Jan. 6, 2016 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.
