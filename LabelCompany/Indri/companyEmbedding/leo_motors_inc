Leo Motors Inc.’ Products and Technology to be Exhibited at the San Diego County Fair | Business Wire
























































Leo Motors Inc.’ Products and Technology to be Exhibited at the San 
      Diego County Fair




Del Mar, California, June 12th – July 7th, 2009


Select Vehicles Available For Order






June 15, 2009 08:31 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Leo 
      Motors, Inc. (OTC: LEOM), an innovative automotive company engaged 
      in the development, manufacture, and marketing of Electric Vehicles 
      (“EVs”) and EV components, will demonstrate its product line up and 
      technology at the world famous San Diego County Fair taking place in Del 
      Mar, California from Friday, June 12 through Tuesday, July 7, 2009.
    


      Representatives from Leo Motors will answer questions about the company, 
      its technology, the EV industry, and will demonstrate one of Leo’s 
      electric scooter models.
    

      Consumers will be able to order select EVs including the impressive 
      “Leo-1000” and “Hilless” scooters at the Expo. These products range in 
      price from $2,900 to $4,000 and are eligible for the tax credits and 
      deductions allowable for electric vehicles.
    

      The San Diego County Fair offers a unique and special opportunity for 
      marketers to interact with more than one million people in a relaxed and 
      fun environment. Attendance at the Fair the past three years has been at 
      an all-time high, with each year topping 1.2 million visitors. Held 
      annually since 1880, the San Diego County Fair has been among North 
      America's top ten fairs in attendance for nearly two decades.
    

      “We are proud to introduce our zero emission electric scooters to the 
      U.S. market at this historic venue,” said Dr. Robert Kang, President and 
      CEO of Leo Motors, Inc. “Our scooters are the world’s first truly 
      sustainable EV products offered in the scooter market. These are not 
      electric toys; they are highly evolved EVs made possible as a result of 
      Leo’s proprietary motor and battery technologies.”
    

      Leo Motors recently received an order for three thousand Hilless 
      scooters in Seoul, S. Korea for use for food delivery services. The 
      full-scale release of Leo Motors products to the United States is 
      expected in the fourth quarter 2009.
    

      Leo Motors' Hilless business motorcycle model uses digital automobile 
      technologies such as driving mode, whipping mode, and Ultra Balance 
      Battery Management System (BMS) for sustainable use. Until now, problems 
      traditionally faced by electric bikes have included an inability to run 
      long distances up steep hills; sudden power loss immediately after 
      achieving peak power; batteries that fail to work properly; and 
      prohibitive expense.
    

      Leo's innovative drive mode enables the motor to exert the optimum 
      torque in each RPM range. Leo's whipping mode cuts off the power supply 
      to the motor as the motor works fast enough to mount the road (analogous 
      to a spinning or whipping top). Between whipping intervals, the motor is 
      able to rest, thus preventing it from becoming overheated.
    

      The Battery Management System represents another EV evolution. Leo's 
      Ultra Balance BMS maintains the balance of voltage between the battery 
      cells up to 0.01 Volt.

      investor presentations, and more. The company’s website is www.leomotors.com.
    

About Leo Motors, Inc.


      Leo Motors has several proprietary designs for new electric vehicles for 
      various uses including taxis; fleet operations such as police, mail 
      delivery, and resorts; as well as a unique electric motor cycle. Leo 
      Motors is also developing a revolutionary multi-motor system as well as 
      a new type of refuelable zinc air fuel cell.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(OTCBB:LEOM) announces the acquisition of three specialty automotive companies; Leo Motors Factory I, Leo Motors Factory II, and Erum Motors. The acquisitions were accomplished under very favorable terms.   																								   																								Leo Motors Factory I and Leo Motors Factory II are "high end" maintenance facilities equipped and staffed to specialize in repairing hand-made luxury cars including Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche, and Rolls Royce. Erum Motors is an exclusive dealership known for and specializing in trading luxury cars. Each of the three companies bring Leo successful revenue production which will hereafter be consolidated into the revenue statements of Leo Motors. A significant objective of these acquisitions is for Leo Motors to establish Korea's first "Electric Vehicle Repair Shop" designed to maintain and repair Hybrid cars as well as pure electric cars to fulfill the growing needs of the large auto makers and "green" consumers. Leo Motors also intends to add major electric vehicle dealerships to the Erum Motors lineup. Dr. Kang, the CEO of Leo Motors said, "these acquisitions will not only provide Leo Motors with fundamental profit generation but foundations for future complementary profit centers."      Leo Signed MOU for Joint Venture in Japan       2014.12.24 10:01 																												HIT 231 																												ADDRESS COPY                   Leo Motors Inc. (OTCBB: LEOM) announced that it signed the Memorandum of Understanding with Eco Holdings, leading solar energy company in Japan to establish a joint venture company in Japan.  The joint venture will manufacture and market electric fishing boats and energy storage systems in Japan. Signing the MOU, both companies are doing their best in developing electric fishing boats suitable to the Japanese fishing industry.       LEOM Takes International Lead in Electrical Safety Technology       2014.09.30 09:33 																			HIT 157 																			ADDRESS COPY                  												  												Seoul, South Korea /Sept 29, 2014 / Leo Motors Inc. (OTCBB: LEOM) has acquired global exclusivity of the breakthrough Short Circuit Prevention (SCP), and Electromagnetic Interception (EI) Technologies.  The exclusivity covers all SCP and EI applications for cars and boats as well as a proprietary Electric Boat energy storage system.      The patented SCP and EI technologies were invented by TPT Co., Ltd. in Korea. TPT challenges the leadership in the electric device market by developing ultra-light, high power, higher efficiency LED lamps. It received the Gold Prize with the SCP technology in 2013 Excellent Patent Technology Awards hosted by the government agencies including Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) and Korea Invention Promotion Association (KIPA).        This new technology enables LEOM to be the first company in the world offering water friendly EV and E-Boats.  EI technology also protects passengers from electromagnetic radiation in EV’s and E-Boats.      The dynamic and growing demand for electric and hybrid electric vehicles is creating proliferation of batteries in excess of 300 Volts.  Users of such cars are exposed to the potential of fatal electric shock accidents.   E-boat power systems have traditionally presented electric shock hazards because of the proximity of water. The new technologies eliminate such dangers    .    Hybrid and electric cars may be carcinogenic based on emission of extremely low frequency (ELF), electromagnetic radiation (EMR), or magnetic fields. Recent studies of such emissions do not agree on occupant risk or safety.  The SCP and EI technology and Leo’s power systems eliminate both short circuits and emission of electromagnetic radiation.      Dr. Shi Chul Kang, CEO of Leo Motors, said, “Leo now makes the safest electric power system ensuring that operators and passengers are free from both electric shock and electromagnetic radiation.  We will endeavor to make SCP and EI requirements for licensing EV’s and E-Boats to prevent electric power system injuries or death.” Dr. Kang added, “Leo Motors stands ready to facilitate utilization and implementation of these technologies by the automotive and marine manufacturers of the world.

(otcqb:LEOM) ("Leo Motors" or the "Company"), an electric supercar and electrical energy storage device maker, is pleased to announce that Jung Yong Lee, CEO of Leo Motors, has been selected by Fortune magazine as one of the 25 most powerful business leaders in Korea for 2013.

Electric Bikes  Hilless Series  Eleven Series     With the goal of creating the fastest electric bike in the world, we developed a high speed motorcycle branded "Eleven." Eleven is a shortened form of "Electric Heaven" with the number 11 itself resembling the shape of an electric outlet.  Power Pack  BMS    We've developed our own state of art Battery Management System ("BMS").  World Box    The World Box is a 1, 3, or 5kW of high density electricity storage for office, home, and power utility for solar/wind powered buildings.  Range Extender  ZAFC (Zinc Air Fuel Cell)    Tiny zinc balls in the ZAFC power pack will supply electricity to the battery. When driving long distances there will be zero emission and gas, vehicle weight will be lighter, and energy efficiency will be increased. Moreover, ZAFC power pack will be more cost-efficient than engine and the cost of zinc balls are very reasonable as well because the sludge from ZAFC power pack (oxidized zinc balls) are common elements found in digital equipments.  Engine Generator    The 15kW BLDC motor generator developed by Leo charges the 60kW power train. This system is currently being tested in a 1 ton carrying capacity truck, which are the most common types of trucks used around the world. After rigorous tests and receiving official test certificates, we will market them to auto makers throughout the world.  EV Packaging Services    Leo can convert any vehicles into EV by using its power trains and conversion parts.
