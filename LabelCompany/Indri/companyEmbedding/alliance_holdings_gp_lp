Alliance Holdings GP, L.P. (AHGP) is a limited partnership formed in November 
2005 to own and control Alliance Resource Management GP, LLC, the managing 
general partner of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (ARLP), a publicly traded 
limited partnership engaged in the production and marketing of coal to major 
U.S. utilities and industrial users.
AHGP owns certain general partner interests, all of the incentive 
distribution rights and 31,088,338 common units in ARLP.
The primary business objective of AHGP is to increase its cash distributions

growth strategies, and could include helping ARLP to:

Expand its operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in 
existing, adjacent or neighboring properties;
Develop new mining complexes in locations with attractive market conditions;
Continue to make productivity improvements in order to be a safe, low-cost 
producer in each region in which it operates;
Strengthen its position with existing and future customers by offering a 
broad range of coal qualities, transportation alternatives and customized 
services.

In the future, AHGP also may support the growth of ARLP through the use of 
capital resources, which could involve loans or capital contributions to ARLP to 
provide funding for the acquisition of a business or asset or for an internal 
growth project.
The principal executive offices of AHGP are located at 1717 S. Boulder Ave.,

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
