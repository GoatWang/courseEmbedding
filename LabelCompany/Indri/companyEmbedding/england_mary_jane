Mary Jane’s Medicinals produces some of the best quality cannabis infused topical products on the market. The topical application of cannabis has been shown to be very effective for pain management, healing of injuries, relaxation, and improving skin health and appearance.
Cannabis used topically does not produce the psychoactive effects that are commonly associated with smoking or ingesting cannabis, so pain relief and healing can occur while maintaining a clear head.
Carefully formulated using rich plant oils and healing herbs, every Mary Jane’s Medicinals product works symbiotically with the incredible healing qualities of cannabis to create the most therapeutic products we can… helping your body heal itself.

Lip Bong
The evolution of lip balm
Throw away your ordinary lip balm and switch to our incredible Lip Bong! This silky balm glides on the lips with a pleasant hint of peppermint. Rich, cannabis infused plant oils make it incredibly moisturizing for even the most chapped and cracked lips. Cannabis is also a powerful anti-viral making this balm very effective in preventing and treating cold sores. Rub it on your temples for headache relief!

Massage Oil
Experience the “Ganjassage”
Our massage oil has a lovely smooth texture that absorbs easily through the skin. It is very popular among massage therapists for this reason. The cannabinoids in the oil interact with receptors in the peripheral nervous system to promote systemic relaxation and relief of chronic pain issues- also making for a more therapeutic massage. You’ll LOVE the “Ganjassage”.

Topical Tincture
Promotes healing with fast acting pain relief
Do you need fast acting pain relief? Our Topical Tincture’s alcohol base allows rapid absorption into the skin. Its cannabis/arnica infusion work incredibly well together for fast, effective pain relief. Nothing beats our Topical Tincture in promoting the healing of injuries. Rub it on your temples and back of neck for fast migraine relief.

Body Lotion
A permagrin for your skin 🙂
Our body lotion is a great product for treating pain issues that cover larger areas of the body like neuralgia, neuropathy, and restless leg syndrome because it easily spreads over the skin. Cannabis is very good at helping the body regenerate itself, so this lotion has been quite effective at restoring sun damaged or aging skin. Apply it all over the body before bed for a restful nights sleep.

About the Company

	Mention NECCO and most people think “Wafers” and for good reason. We have been making these delicious candies since 1847, so it is no surprise that “NECCO” and “Wafers” have become synonymous, like Thomas Edison and the light bulb.

	However, just as the light bulb was not Edison’s only invention, NECCO Wafers are not our only candy. We also produce some of America’s most beloved iconic candies including Sweethearts, Mary Janes, Candy Buttons, Clark Bars, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Slap Stix, and Sky Bars among many other sweet treats. Over the course of our storied history, we have proudly stayed true to our New England roots, only leaving our longtime Cambridge, MA home a few years ago to stretch our legs in the nearby Boston suburb of Revere in an 810,000 square-foot factory where we have plenty of innovation room to bring you new sweets to enjoy alongside your favorite classics.

	If that sounds simple, it’s because it is. We make candy, and we’re proud of our sweet history. Candy should always be fun, so we hope you have as much fun with our candy as we do!

Our History

	If you want to pick a pivotal time in American innovation, one should look no further than the 1840s, a decade which saw the invention of the grain elevator, the sewing machine, the rotary printing press, the safety pin, and even baseball.

	In particular, focusing in on 1847 holds a special place in the heart of NECCO, as the progressive thinker Oliver Chase constructed the lozenge cutter, a device which proved to be America’s first candy machine. Chase’s invention not only gave birth to the Wafer that would make our company famous, it also jumpstarted the nation’s entire candy industry.

	Progressing forward, Oliver Chase, alongside his brothers Silas and Daniel, the originator of Conversation Hearts, spent the next two decades marketing their confectionery treats across the United States and Canada.
	Then in the early 1870s, the Chase brother’s business almost went up in flames—literally. Daniel, who was in charge of the Western business, saw his building destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The following year in Boston, Oliver’s building burnt down as well.

	What could have been the end of something big actually gave rise to something even bigger. Daniel left Chicago to return to Boston, teaming up with the confectionery company of Fobes, Hayward and Company. Around the same time, Oliver partnered with local merchant T. Pickering Drown. Thirty years later, in 1901, these two relationships would merge along with a third candy company, Wright & Moody, to form the New England Confectionery Company, commonly known as NECCO.

	Since then, NECCO’s candies have been enjoyed the world over, and our acquisitions of brands such as Clark Bar, Mary Jane and Squirrel Nut Zippers have breathed new life into our beloved American company along the way.

	Our innovative accomplishments paired with our place as the country’s oldest continuously operating candy company create a history of which we are extremely proud. It is a history we continue to write every day with every piece of delicious candy that comes out of our Revere factory, which sits just a few miles from where Oliver Chase pioneered NECCO and the American candy industry over a century and a half ago.

NECCO Wafers®

In 1847, a young English immigrant and progressive thinker, Oliver Chase, invented the first American candy machine, a lozenge cutter. After a period of initial success selling his exciting new candy, he joined forces with brother, Silas Edwin, and founded Chase and Company, the pioneer member of the NECCO family.

	In 1901, Chase and Company, merged with both Fobes, Hayward & Company and Wright & Moody to officially form the New England Confectionery Company, or NECCO as it is affectionately known. Over the years, NECCO prospered, producing many well known products, but its success was propelled by its most beloved candy: NECCO Wafers.

	Due to its enduring popularity, the original recipe for the NECCO Wafer has remained essentially unchanged over the years, and the Wafers today are still made in the same original eight flavors of chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, lemon, lime, orange, wintergreen and clove! The ingredients are simply sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, gums, colorings and flavorings – sweet simplicity!

	From the time of their creation, NECCO Wafers have been enjoyed the world over. In 1913, explorer Donald MacMillan took NECCO Wafers on his Arctic explorations, using them for nutrition and as rewards for Eskimo children. Later, in the 1930’s, Admiral Byrd took 2½ tons of NECCO Wafers on an expedition to the South Pole, which amounted to about a pound a week for each of his men during their two-year stay in the Antarctic.

	During World War II, the U.S. Government requisitioned a major portion of the production of NECCO Wafers. Since the candy doesn’t melt and is difficult to break during transit, it was perfect for shipping overseas to the troops!

	Though they were first created some time ago, NECCO Wafers have stood the test of time. Every day new fans are discovering their sweetness while longtime loyal fans are still relishing the feelings of nostalgia that come with unwrapping and savoring each Wafer in every roll.

	Today, NECCO produces approximately four billion NECCO Wafers on an annual basis. To put this in perspective, if the Wafers were placed edge to edge, they could wrap around the world… twice! 

	In addition to simply savoring the sweetness, creative NECCO Wafer fans have invented various additional uses for NECCO Wafers over the years. They have been used as poker chips, for First Communion practice and as bulls-eyes at target ranges.  If only Oliver Chase could have known back then the imagination of future NECCO Wafer fans!

	NECCO Wafers came to delight our taste buds with their yummy flavors over a century ago and look forward to an even sweeter future!



Canada® Mints

Canada Mints are the beloved mints known nationwide for being a deliciously sweet and refreshing treat. They first appeared in the Canadian market during the late 1880’s. By 1908, their popularity had caught on and spread rapidly to an excited audience in the United States. With a booming demand for these sugar lozenge mints, Canada Mints were packaged in a 5 cent unit in 1916 for more consumer-friendly purchasing and consumption in the years to come.

		Canada Mints have enjoyed decades of widespread success remaining mostly unchanged. Today, they are still one of the most renowned sugar lozenge mints in the United States, with Wintergreen and Peppermint as the most popular flavors. Canada Mints’ iconic flavor, appearance and packaging have enjoyed a storied history of success of simply sweet refreshment and look forward to being savored by NECCO fans for many years to come.
		 

Candy House® Candy Buttons

Candy Buttons are one of the most dearly loved candies that bring back sweet nostalgic memories of childhood fun!

Then, just a short time later in 1989, NECCO acquired the Candy House Button brand, which made NECCO the exclusive manufacturer of this extremely popular American product.

		Candy Buttons are packed on their now iconic strips of paper in rows of three, and come in three yummy flavors that correspond to the different colors on the strip: lemon, lime and cherry. Fans love to share that they have come up with many creative methods of eating these sweet treats off the paper!

		Throughout the course of a single year, NECCO makes 3/4 billion Candy Buttons - all to satisfy the sweet tooth of fans of a fun candy that reminds us to always stay a kid at heart!



Clark®


Born in Ireland, David L. Clark came to America when he was only eight years old. He recalls in his memoirs, "My primary education consisted of just one year in grade school. After that I found it necessary to work or starve. Like many other energetic poor boys, my business career started by selling newspapers and carrying market baskets at the age of nine. When I was 12, I went to Business College at night and worked through the day."

With this spirit of hard work and dedication, D.L. Clark took his first steady job in a frame factory, making $1.50 a week. After that, he worked in various occupations including, but not limited to, paint manufacturing, rolling mills, art glass factories, fish markets, wholesale notions, and wagon delivery. He noted that in addition to what he learned in Business College, he had also learned a great deal through "extensive travels both in America and in many foreign countries, and the best of all teachers: the School of Experience."

D.L. Clark entered the candy industry when he began working for a small New York candy manufacturer. After three years as a traveling salesman with a "country wagon," he bought the peddling wagon, horses, and merchandise and went into business for himself.

From there, the D.L. Clark Company was founded in 1886 when Clark started manufacturing candy in two back rooms of a small house in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. When D.L. Clark started selling candy in the streets of Pittsburgh, the prospect of becoming a giant in the confectionery industry was far from his thoughts. However, during his lifetime, the D.L. Clark Company became a leading candy manufacturer and the Clark Bar emerged as one of the nation's favorite treats.

Clark's business grew steadily, and in 1911, the company moved to larger quarters at a cracker factory on Pittsburgh's North Side. The D.L. Clark Company continued to expand and prosper at that location for 75 years, manufacturing some of America's best-known candies. The company experimented with a variety of ingredients that had never been used in candy before. Clark introduced confections filled with coconut, mint and peanut butter and was an overall industry leader in marketing candy bars. Three of its best creations were Clark, Zagnut, and Clark Coconut Crunch Bar.

Clark scored an important marketing success when it introduced the five-cent-sized Clark Bar. Initially, the bar was individually wrapped to facilitate shipment of candy to American troops during World War I. The Clark Bar became extremely popular with the soldiers, and its popularity carried over to the general public in the years following the conclusion of the war.

By 1920, the D.L. Clark Company was making about 150 different types of candy, including several five-cent bars, specialty items and a bulk candy line. The Clark Company also manufactured chewing gum, and in 1921, they incorporated the Clark Brothers Chewing Gum Company, makers of Teaberry and Tendermint. However, by 1931, the candy bar business had grown so large that Clark decided to close this secondary gum venture and specialize exclusively in candy bars.

In 1955, the Clark family sold their candy business to the Beatrice Food Company, which operated the company until 1983, when candy manufacturer Leaf, Inc acquired the confectionery division of Beatrice foods, including Clark. When Leaf, Inc. announced plans to move the candy operations from Pittsburgh, the city protested. The candy plant and rights to the Clark, Slo Poke and Black Cow candies were sold, and D.L. Clark became part of the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company. After a period of financial instability, the company was again sold in June of 1995. The Company was renamed Clark Bar America and distribution was re-established. New product lines were also selectively introduced including Winter Clark, Clark Dark, and the Yoo-hoo Candy Bar.

However, Clark Bar America again fell into financial difficulty and in May of 1999, NECCO purchased the assets of Clark Bar America. From there the Clark Bar entered into a bright future with the beloved family of classic NECCO candies. 

In 2012, the Clark brand expanded with the introduction of the very popular Clark Bites, which are bite-sized versions of the Clark Bar. These treats took fans by storm with their seemingly perfect ratio of real milk chocolate to real peanut butter. A year later, in 2013, the entire Clark brand experienced a refreshing revival with a multi-media digital and television advertising campaign that challenges fans to answer the question: “Are you Clark enough?”


Haviland® & Deran Confectionery

Deran S. Hintlian, founder of the Deran Confectionery Company, came to the United States from Armenia at the age of 17 and soon went to work in his uncle’s candy factory selling candy throughout his community. Years later he would become what was known as a candy-jobber, a salesman selling the product to retailers.

	Continuing his ambitious rise in the candy industry, his next big step came in 1929 with the acquisition of the bankrupt Windsor Confectionery Company located in Union Square in Somerville, MA. There, alongside his family, Hintlian manufactured, candy-jobbed and also ran a retail store. At the Somerville factory, Hintlian became the first person to pack peanuts in cellophane bags, which was an innovative packaging product in the industry at that time.

	Around 1931, the Hintlian family purchased the Murray Confectionery Company on Commercial Street in Boston and moved their operation there. They enjoyed success in their manufactured chocolates, sugar-panned almonds, brazil-nuts, peanuts, and bagged roasted nuts.

	Seeking a bigger location again in 1936, the family moved its business to the location at 134 Cambridge Street in Lechmere Square in Cambridge, MA, a location which saw many expansions in the years following purchase.

	The firm continued to grow through the acquisition of other smaller candy makers. In 1961, Deran purchased the Miller and Hollis Corporation, the manufacturer of Haviland Chocolate. The Haviland brand of real chocolate products soon became their flagship brand. In 1963, Deran purchased the C.S. Allen Corporation of Webster, which specialized in the production of toffees and English-style hard candies.

	Upon Deran Hintlian’s death in 1966, his wife became president of the firm. She ran the business with the help of a cousin, Harry Hintlian, who assumed the presidency in 1970 when Deran Confectionery Company was sold to the Borden Corporation. At that time, Borden was the fifth largest food company in the world.

	Deran specialized in high volume, popular-priced sweets, and most of their products were chocolate. To help meet their goal of offering high-quality confections at affordable prices, Deran made their goods entirely from scratch, processing their own cocoa liquor, and milling their own chocolate. As a result, Deran’s products enjoyed wide acceptance, especially in New England and throughout the Northeast.

	In the early 1990’s, Borden sold the business to Great American Brands, an investment group. Soon after in 1994, NECCO purchased the assets of the Deran Confectionery Company, including most notably the Haviland brand of chocolates. NECCO continued to operate the Deran plant at 134 Cambridge Street in Cambridge until 2003, when NECCO consolidated all their New England operations into a new facility in Revere, MA. NECCO continues to proudly manufacture the full line of Haviland brand real chocolate products at their world headquarters in Revere today!
	 

Mary Jane® 

In 1884, Charles H. Miller and his three sons founded a small business manufacturing and selling homemade candy in the famous Paul Revere House in Boston’s Faneuil Hall/North End area.

	After their father’s death, the Miller boys split the responsibilities of the family business.  Charles N. Miller took charge of the manufacturing and wholesale operations while his brothers ran the retail store. In 1914, after the Charles N. Miller Company established its reputation as a successful business, they began manufacturing their legendary Mary Janes. The delicious molasses and peanut butter chew was named for their favorite aunt, Mary Jane.

	Over the years, the Miller Company tried several variations of the legendary Mary Jane mixture, but none could compare to the original. The Miller Company also introduced several other candies during its time in operation, but none enjoyed the same great success as Mary Jane. Over time, Mary Jane came to be the only candy produced by the Miller Company, and it enjoyed decades of continued popularity.

	In 1990, NECCO purchased the Stark Candy Company, which owned the Mary Jane and Mary Jane Peanut Butter Kisses lines, both of which have seen tremendous growth. With this acquisition, NECCO has become the number one producer of Peanut Butter Kisses in the country.

	Many adults can remember reaching up to the candy counter and seeing the charming Mary Jane girl that adorned every piece of this delicious candy, and ever since 1914 the legendary Mary Jane name has been synonymous with children, young and old alike.


Mighty Malts® Malted Milk Balls

Mighty Malts Malted Milk Balls were introduced to the public back in the late 1960’s. They were one of the first brands to use an actual “milk carton” as a packaging for malted milk balls, a fun twist that stood out among an increasing amount of competitors in the candy industry.

	Years later, NECCO extended the Mighty Malts to include a full line of colorful assorted malted milk eggs for Easter. They became a springtime favorite for fans with both innovative carton packaging that for Easter became a “Bunny House” and also assorted malted milk egg bags, perfect for filling Easter baskets!

	Today, Mighty Malts are as popular as ever, enjoyed year round by many passionate fans. In addition to their immense popularity during Easter, they also appear in a delicious Holiday theme for the Christmas season. Mighty Malts, with their crunchy centers and irresistible chocolate coating, are an everyday favorite delight!
	 

Slap Stix®

A swirled caramel pop with banana flavored nougat center makes Slap Stix one of NECCO’s most unique treats. In 1920, Howard B. Stark originated the first caramel and swirled nougat pop which was then known as a “Snirkle.” The Snirkle remained a popular treat throughout the Stark Company’s history, which included several changes of ownership. However, it found a home later with the NECCO family where its name was changed to Slap Stix. Today it is still one of the most beloved, nostalgic chewy treats – a unique caramel lollipop enjoyed by all ages!


Sky Bar®

The story of the Sky Bar begins with its creation in 1938. A chocolate bar with four unique fillings was a monumental development in the candy industry at that time. Accordingly, the first public appearance had to be equally as impressive, so NECCO first announced Sky Bar by means of a dramatic skywriting advertising campaign. NECCO was the first candy manufacturer in this country to introduce a molded chocolate bar with four distinctly different centers enrobed in chocolate. The four flavor fillings are fudge, caramel, peanut and vanilla nougat, the same four that appear today!

	Sky Bar was an instant success and enjoyed widespread popularity. In 1945, the blackout and curfew in Times Square was lifted on VE-Day after three years of darkness. Only six display signs had their lighting equipment ready for operation and NECCO’s Sky Bar was one of them! This welcoming of the “lights” was celebrated by more than 250,000 people! Over the years following its introduction, Sky Bar was heavily advertised on television and radio and also through a number of well-read print publications.

	Sky Bar still remains the only chocolate bar to have four different flavors in the same bar-- a truly unique, and delectable, treat!

	 

Squirrel Nut Zippers®



	The Squirrel brand dates back to 1890 when it was started as the Austin T. Merrill Company in Massachusetts.  The company’s ownership changed in 1899 when the firm was officially incorporated as Squirrel Brands Salted Nut Company. At this time, two long-time employees, Perley G. Gerrish and Fred S. Green took over the business with goals of expansion and product innovation. As the company grew, it moved from its Boston location to Cambridge, MA in 1903 and then again to a larger building on Boardman Street in Cambridge in 1915.

	From salted and roasted peanuts to chewy candy favorites, Squirrel Nut Company developed a loyal and enthusiastic customer base. It even supplied candy and roasted nuts to the armed forces. Some of their brands have included Butter Chews, Nut Twins, Nut Chews and Nut Yippee as well as a wide range of peanut butter kisses and salt water taffy.

	Their flagship product was “Squirrel Nut Zippers,” a vanilla, caramel and nut taffy. The interesting name actually came from an illegal drink served secretly during prohibition. The name is fun and unique, and one that many fans loved. For example, during the 1990’s, a retro swing band named themselves the “Squirrel Nut Zippers” and even sometimes gave out the candy during their performances!

	In 1999, Squirrel Brand Company, which at the time was one of the oldest family-owned candy companies, was purchased by Southern Style Nuts and the entire production operation was moved to Denison, TX. 

	Soon after the move, in 2004, NECCO picked up the license to manufacture the Squirrel Brand Company’s brands from Southern Style Nuts. At last, Squirrel Nut Zippers had come back home to Massachusetts, where their sweet, storied history began over a century ago.


Sweethearts®



	Sweethearts, the sweet candy hearts with the quirky sayings, have been a beloved childhood staple for many generations and are the best-selling Valentine’s Day candy. Each year, NECCO manufactures about two billion hearts in order to keep up with the passionate demand for this American classic.

	Given its ever-growing popularity, it's hard to believe that the concept behind today’s Sweethearts was created around the time that Abraham Lincoln was President! The conversation hearts of the 1860’s, Mottoes, seemed to have come into prominence during the time when “cockles,” a small crisp candy made of sugar and flour formed in the shape of a cockle or scallop shell, were a favorite on the market. The early cockles contained mottoes, which were printed on thin colored paper and rolled up inside.

	In the 1860's, Daniel Chase, the brother of NECCO's founder father, Oliver Chase, began printing sayings on the candy. He experimented first with hand tools, and then devised a machine in which a felt roller pad, moistened with vegetable coloring, usually red, pressed against the die. The die printed the words on the lozenge paste and the double purpose machine cut the lozenges. 

	Grown-ups were entertained and passed the hearts around at parties. For weddings, there were wedding-day lozenges with humorously long-winded prophecies such as:  “Married in satin, Love will not be lasting,” “Married in Pink, He will take to drink” and “Married in white, You have chosen right.”

	The present day Sweethearts date back to 1902. Back then, besides hearts, they also produced candy in other various shapes such as postcards, baseballs, horseshoes and watches.

	While today's sayings are on average much shorter, some of the original sayings are still in rotation, including "Be Mine," "Be Good," "Be True," "Kiss Me." In honor of NECCO's 150th Anniversary in 1997, a saying was brought back from the early 1900's: "The One I Love." And in 2014, the longtime favorite “Let’s Read” also reappeared in the mix, capturing some classic charm.

	In the early 1990's, NECCO’s then Vice President Walter Marshall began an initiative to update the sayings each year, retiring some while adding others. The first new phrase, “Fax Me,” gained a lot of attention from Sweetheart fans. Following this notable effort,   each year NECCO now receives hundreds of saying suggestions from romantics, candy lovers and school kids. From old tech, "Call Me” to new tech, "E-mail Me," Sweethearts keep the pulse on the heartbeat of the nation.

	While most people love to eat them, Sweethearts have also been used in other ingenious ways over the years: to propose marriage, to teach children statistics and reading, to decorate cakes, and as borders for frames. The uses for this sweet treat are seemingly endless!

	One thing Sweetheart lovers can count on each year is the candy's simple, familiar formula. Both Sweethearts and NECCO Wafers use the same batter: sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, gums, coloring and flavoring. Once the dough is rolled out, imprinted with sayings and then stamped out in the familiar heart shape, it goes through a 45-minute drying cycle to reach its proper consistency.

	To meet the high demand for Sweethearts, NECCO continuously produces them from late February through mid-January of the following year, and amazingly, the entire annual production, approximately 2 Billion individual Sweethearts, sells out in just six weeks! One thing is for sure, no matter what the cute sayings are, fans will always love to celebrate Valentine’s Day with Sweethearts!

A wide variety of high-quality cannabis products for your enjoyment.
Our menu includes Marijuana Buds, Hashish, Extracts and Edibles. Please make your choices from the categories below. Add up the total, add the shipping fee, then send me an email to get payment and ordering info.  ** Please remember to add the $20 shipping fee to each order. **   ** Attention Nunavut clients: Because of the extra expense involved in packing, we are raising our shipping cost to $50 for all orders going to Nunavut. ** Usually we can provide the strain you request, but we reserve the right to substitute strains as supply demands. 



				Marijuana/Weed (Buds)


Top Grade = These are well-grown, higher-end strains. Potent, fragrant, tasty and clean-burning. You can request a mixed variety of strains. The selection consists of various types of Marijuana. Indica's, Sativa's and Crosses. Mid Grade = Decent quality, more generic strains. Less flavour and potency than the Top Grade. Usually only one or two types of Mid Grade are available at a time. Low Grade = These buds will be outdoor-grown, or lower-quality indoor buds. We usually only have one Low Grade strain at at time. We also offer the "Shake Blend" as a Low Grade option, it's a mix of all our bag-ends from the Top and Mid Grade strains. 




				Hashish (Solids)



Hashish is the extracted resin from a marijuana plant. Hashish can be sticky or hard, powdery or pressed, and color ranges between light green, brown and black, depending on potency and how it is made. Top Grade = These are usually made using cold-water extraction and sieving with "bubblebags". This product usually comes unpressed, and is best smoked in small quantities on a screen in a pipe or bong. Our A Grade hashes are not "full melt" but they are strong and clean. Mid Grade = These are usually dry-sift, kif or imported hash varieties. Will range between hard pressed, crumbly and unpressed, powder form. 




				Mary Jane's Extracts



Amber Oil = !! This is a thick, viscous translucent oil sold in 1-gram vials (will vary from 0.9-1.1g). It is great smoking with hot knives, in a bong or just for smearing onto your rolling paper. Just heat the vial up with a lighter to make spreading easy. Budder = Budder is back and better than ever. We have a new supplier with even higher-quality and potency than before! Isopropyl extract, soft consistency, great for dabbing. Margarine = This is a product similar to Budder, but using butane to extract the THC from the bud instead of isopropyl. Very potent. Soft, chalky texture when at room temperature. Also like Budder probably best consumed pure.Dabs = Super clean, medical grade, highly pure and potent cannabis extract for dabbing. Connoisseur-grade extract, made from top-grade buds. Retains all the flavors and characteristics of the original strain intact. Translucent gold. Shatters when frozen, sticky at room temperature. A little bit goes a long way! 




				Mary Jane's Edibles



Cookies = Cookies are of a standardized strength, but effects will vary depending on body weight and if your stomach is empty. 1-2 cookies is one dose. Please choose between our simple sugar cookies or the new pecan shortbread. Budder Bars = Big tasty granola bar with rolled oats, rice krispies, almonds, nuts, and BudderKing Budder. 1/3 of a bar is one dose. Honey Jar = 100ml jar of marijuana-infused, edible honey. Contains 10 standard 10ml (2tsp) doses. Pleasant, relaxing effect.Lolli-Pots = They come in a pair, so you can share. Or not ;) Super fun - not too heavy - Three delicious flavours - Caramel, RootBeer, or Sugarfree Butterscotch. CannaGels = Organic Olive Oil infused with cannabis resin in a gelatin capsule. 1-2 capsules will provide pain and symptom relief. 4-5 capsules can produce significant psychoactive effect.

Payless has women's shoes for every occasion and any time of year. From stylish sandals for the warm months to furry lined boots for cold and snow, you'll find what you're looking for at a great price. You'll look great, too, whether you're at the office, at the store, or enjoying a night out with friends or coworkers. 
Feeling more formal? Payless offers pumps and heels that emphasize both fun and sophistication, such as a sleek, pointed-toe style with a wrapped three-inch heel. You'll also find special occasion and holiday dress shoes for that extra touch of class.
For those chilly days and nights, you might choose a slipper, moccasin, short boot or tall boot. Look for lined moccasins to embrace your feet in furry comfort, commuter boots for good-looking durability, lined boots for luxurious warmth, and many other styles to keep your feet happy in the cold. But it doesn't have to be cold for boots. Anytime is right for a comfortable, eye-catching lace-up that works with just about any casual outfit.
Every closet should have a good selection of flats, and Payless fills the bill. You'll even find dance shoes – ballet, jazz, and tap. For on and off the dance floor, you can pick from Oxford, slip-on, ballet, moccasin, and dress flats in a wide variety of styles.
Sandals are a must-have for warmer weather, and you'll find wedges, gladiators, and many other styles. T-strap pump sandals are a terrific choice for a more formal look. Wedge slings are perfect for a shopping trip. Slides are ideal for a day at the pool or beach. You can choose the right sandal for any spring or summer occasion.
If you're the active type, Payless has the women's shoes to fit. You'll find running, skating, and walking shoes as well as canvas slip-ons and sneakers. So let the athlete in you run wild in style — or just relax and have a little fun. Either way, you'll look good doing it.
The only way to fully appreciate the wide selection, dazzling style, and great comfort of women's shoes from Payless is to see it for yourself. So shop online or at a Payless ShoeSource store today and add some footwear style to your closet.

Payless girls' shoes come in enough styles to keep up with even the busiest girl's life. And that life can be very full — from school to athletic events to dance class to a dozen other activities that keep her - and you - running. You want her always to have the right shoes, and she wants to look her best in them. Payless has the solutions to keep everybody happy.
When it's time to dress up a bit, you'll find Mary Jane pumps and flats, heeled dress shoes, and heeled sandals. They're perfect for parties and dances where a more formal look is called for. When the scene is more casual, or it's just another day at school, she might prefer a canvas sneaker. Flats are the choice for comfort, and moccasins are ideal for lounging around the house. Leather T-straps are as durable as they are good-looking. Even a small selection of these styles will do for a day of work and play.
When the weather turns wet and cold, you can turn to girls' rain boots from Payless. Boots in general are popular these days, and among the girls' shoes Payless offers, you can find a wide variety. There are heeled boots, sweater boots, lace-up boots, scrunch and stretch boots, and other styles. They work with almost any casual outfit.
Active girls will get a kick out of the sneakers and athletic shoes Payless has to offer. You'll find comfortable, casual slip-ons as well as trendy runners and sneakers in styles for girls of all ages. Is your girl into dance? Payless has Spotlights ballet, tap, and jazz shoes to help her make her dreams come true.
You can give your girl the shoes she needs and the look she wants — and do it all without breaking the bank. Treat her to shoes from Payless for all the fun of growing up. Visit Payless.com today.

The English Tea Store carries many popular British cookies and cakes that can be paired as an afternoon snack with a cup of tea. McVities, the most popular biscuit and cookie name brand in the UK, has many of its sweets on our site, including digestive biscuits, Hob Nobs, Rich Tea biscuits, and cream-filled bars, like Penguin Biscuits and Lyles Gold Syrup Creams. We also carry crunch creams and wafer cookies from other name brands. All of our cakes are imported from Great Britain and Ireland and some are made with sultanas, a raisin made from white seedless grapes. Our most popular brand is Bronte cakes in a number of fruit varieties, but we also carry Liqueur cakes, a light sponge cake with brandy filling and Irish Cream flavor. Scottish shortbread cookies are another popular item and, around Christmas, can be ordered in holiday tins. We sell boxes and tins by Walker the typical Scottish shortbread cookie, and Norfolk Manor, makers of thin shortbread. In addition, we carry other Christmas sweets year-round, such as Christmas pudding and mincemeat pie filling.
