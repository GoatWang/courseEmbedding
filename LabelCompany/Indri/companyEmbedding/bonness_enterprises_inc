FAQ

Will Bonness Inc. accept a credit card?


Yes, you may pay for your purchase with Mastercard or Visa.


Will I need a permit to build a new driveway?


Probably. Each city and county has its own requirements. You will probably at least need a Right-of-Way permit and in some cities you may also be required to have a building permit. Check with your local authority..


What should I know before choosing a paving contractor?


Unfortunately, the construction industry is plagued with scam artists and driveway paving scams are especially common in our area. You can avoid being another victim by following some practical guidelines. 1) Be weary of someone selling door-to-door. A sure sign of a scam is when a so-called contractor comes to your door claiming to have leftover asphalt after paving another driveway. They will offer you a supposed great deal that is only good today. A reputable contractor will know, with great accuracy, how much paving material is needed to complete a project. Rarely will they have leftover material. Moreover, if the great deal you are offered today is not available tomorrow or next week, it is probably a scam. 2) Never hire someone on the spot. Ask for references and check them! Get a copy of the contractor’s license and certificate of insurance before allowing them on your property. 3) Watch out for unmarked trucks or out-of-area phone numbers. A little research will reveal that they have no permanent address and the phone number is often an answering machine. Reputable contractors are proud to display their name on their vehicles. 4) Insist on a written contract and avoid cash deals. A reputable contractor will accept checks or credit cards and will not require cash-only terms. 5) Avoid a deal that seems too good to be true. If the quoted price seems very low, chances are the quality of work will also be quite low. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion from a locally advertised paving contractor.


What is asphalt made of and what are its characteristics?


Before you employ a paving contractor to install your asphalt driveway or parking lot, it is important that you know what you can expect from the product.  Asphalt is a mixture of various grades of sand and rock (aggregate) and a tar-like substance (asphalt cement) which are heated and blended in an asphalt plant according to a scientifically engineered mix design.
Asphalt is not poured as concrete is, but rather laid with an asphalt paver and compacted with rollers. The result is a continuous smooth riding surface with no expansion joints. It is important that you know that In the process of laying asphalt, some raking must be done to assure a uniform thickness. This raking is usually performed at joints or seams and in areas where the paver cannot access easily. This raking causes some of the larger aggregate to come to the surface. You can always expect that there will be some variations of texture in your completed pavement.
The curing process is also quite different than concrete.  Asphalt cures over a period of months and even years, depending on sun exposure and other factors in the environment.  Asphalt pavement will remain soft during this time and is susceptible to wheel-rashing and other scarring of the surface. Once the asphalt cures, this surface scarring becomes unnoticeable.  Asphalt pavement typically lasts between 10 and 15 years and after its useful life it can be overlaid with a fresh layer of asphalt.

DRIVEWAYS
Asphalt
An attractive driveway is more than an entrance to your home. It is an asset. The appearance of the driveway is the first impression most people have when approaching your property. A properly designed and constructed driveway will add charm, utility, and value to any home. Asphalt is an ideal application for estate driveways where it’s softened, joint free, and flowing appearance compliments a natural setting.
Decorative Stone
Decorative stonework is one of our specialties. The Bonness family has been placing this stylish old Florida look on driveways for over 30 years. Our brown or white river gravel, gray granite, pea-gravel, or crushed seashell embraces our tropical surroundings when bonded to your driveway.  Properly installed, a stone driveway consists of a pressure treated wood edging, a solid limerock or shell base, an application of liquid asphalt cement binder, followed by an 1” application of loose gravel. After it is rolled in and broomed, it provides a beautiful, uniform and functional driveway surface that will last for years. A wide variety of decorative stones are carried locally, but other more exotic stones can be shipped on special order.
Concrete/Stamped Concrete
A concrete driveway makes perfect sense in many neighborhoods.  Though concrete can be installed in any driveway application, it is particularly cost effective and appropriate for smaller driveways where space is limited.  Bonness Inc. pours concrete driveways using only 3000psi concrete mix or higher and to the depth that is structurally needed to support the intended traffic.
Consider stamped concrete for a more decorative look.  Stamped concrete mimics the appearance of brick, slate, flagstone, cobblestone and other patterns.  The look of natural stone can be achieved without the high maintenance and cost of real stone.
Brick Pavers
A brick paver driveway will add beauty and value to your home. With a large variety of colors and shapes available, design options are virtually endless.  An unyielding, professionally installed base to support these decorative pavers will insure a solid foundation for years of functionality as well as the splendor that a brick paver driveway offers.
 
SIDEWALKS
Concrete, Asphalt, Brick Pavers
Bonness Inc. will install or replace your sidewalk, bikepath, cartpath, or other pathway. As a full service contractor, no job is too small.  We have decades of experience and the equipment necessary to install sidewalks and pathways in all types of applications.  Sidewalks may be constructed of concrete, stamped concrete, exposed aggregate concrete, loose bonded gravel, asphalt, or brick pavers.
 
DRAINAGE
Pavement Drainage
No matter the pavement application, drainage is always of particular concern. In the flat terrain that is prevalent in Southwest Florida, standing puddles of water often arise in pavements.  Our estimators will provide advice to you or will work with your design professional to address this area of concern before quotation.  There are different solutions available depending on the circumstances such as increased slope, yard drainage, catch basins, swale grading to name a few. During installation or repair of your pavement, our crews are trained to give special attention to drainage issues.
Culvert & Swale Grading
Many neighborhoods provide drainage through a system of swales.  In this case, culvert pipes are used to allow the flow of water under driveway approaches.  Bonness Inc. installs culverts and concrete mitered end sections in accordance with government standards and requirements.
Concrete Curb & Gutter
Bonness inc. specializes in all type of specialty concrete work.  Whether for drainage or for aesthetic enhancement, different curb types are available to address your specific need. Concrete is also often the best solution for transition areas between different pavement applications.
 
 
RENOVATIONS
Resurface
Asphalt is a wearing surface.  With a properly installed base, asphalt will provide many years of low maintenance service.  After its wearing life, usually 10-15 years, it may be resurfaced with a fresh layer of asphalt.
Removals & Regrading
When renovating your driveway, it may be necessary to remove your existing driveway completely or to remove the surface in order to regrade the base material.  Complete removal may be necessary to accommodate a new surface.  This is generally true when changing from an asphalt driveway to a brick paver driveway as the grade of the base will have to be lowered to accommodate for the thickness of the brick.  Regrading may also be necessary when there are drainage problems or when the base material needs to be enhanced to support vehicle traffic.  Whatever your need, as a full service contractor, Bonness Inc. will provide all the necessary services to complete your finished driveway.
 
 
MAINTENANCE
Repairs
No job is too small for Bonness Inc.  We will perform asphalt and concrete repairs and patching, as well as drainage repairs.  If your budget does not allow for a full renovation, patching and sealing may provide additional life for your pavement.
PolyTar Sealcoat
Bonness Inc. is committed to quality and only uses the best in black top sealers.  PolyTar (link to PolyTar pdf) is the first significant advancement in pavement sealing in over five decades.  Together with a quality installation and under normal circumstances, pavements sealed with PolyTar should not have to be resealed for five years.
 
ESTIMATING & DESIGN
Estimating
Bonness Inc. has a team of estimators specifically trained to address driveway quotes.  We pride ourselves on submitting quotes that provide a clear picture of what it will take to do the project, no matter its size or complexity.  You can count on an estimate that will be prompt, thorough, and accurate.
Budgeting
All projects have different and unique characteristics, so in order to budget for your future needs you will want to obtain an budget estimate.  Estimates are free with no obligation.  Our estimators stand ready to guide you with your pavement related budgets.
Design
The design of your driveway can be accomplished with the help of our estimators or through a design professional such as a landscape architect. Our estimators will recommend the proven design standards in terms of  thickness and application of base and surface materials.
Permitting
Permitting requirements are different throughout the various counties and cities of Southwest Florida.  The owner of the property is generally responsible for any permits where necessary. Bonness Inc. will aid the property owner if needed.

FAQ

Will Bonness Inc. accept a credit card?


Yes, you may pay for your purchase with Mastercard or Visa.


Will I need a permit to build a new driveway?


Probably. Each city and county has its own requirements. You will probably at least need a Right-of-Way permit and in some cities you may also be required to have a building permit. Check with your local authority..


What should I know before choosing a paving contractor?


Unfortunately, the construction industry is plagued with scam artists and driveway paving scams are especially common in our area. You can avoid being another victim by following some practical guidelines. 1) Be weary of someone selling door-to-door. A sure sign of a scam is when a so-called contractor comes to your door claiming to have leftover asphalt after paving another driveway. They will offer you a supposed great deal that is only good today. A reputable contractor will know, with great accuracy, how much paving material is needed to complete a project. Rarely will they have leftover material. Moreover, if the great deal you are offered today is not available tomorrow or next week, it is probably a scam. 2) Never hire someone on the spot. Ask for references and check them! Get a copy of the contractor’s license and certificate of insurance before allowing them on your property. 3) Watch out for unmarked trucks or out-of-area phone numbers. A little research will reveal that they have no permanent address and the phone number is often an answering machine. Reputable contractors are proud to display their name on their vehicles. 4) Insist on a written contract and avoid cash deals. A reputable contractor will accept checks or credit cards and will not require cash-only terms. 5) Avoid a deal that seems too good to be true. If the quoted price seems very low, chances are the quality of work will also be quite low. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion from a locally advertised paving contractor.


What is asphalt made of and what are its characteristics?


Before you employ a paving contractor to install your asphalt driveway or parking lot, it is important that you know what you can expect from the product.  Asphalt is a mixture of various grades of sand and rock (aggregate) and a tar-like substance (asphalt cement) which are heated and blended in an asphalt plant according to a scientifically engineered mix design.
Asphalt is not poured as concrete is, but rather laid with an asphalt paver and compacted with rollers. The result is a continuous smooth riding surface with no expansion joints. It is important that you know that In the process of laying asphalt, some raking must be done to assure a uniform thickness. This raking is usually performed at joints or seams and in areas where the paver cannot access easily. This raking causes some of the larger aggregate to come to the surface. You can always expect that there will be some variations of texture in your completed pavement.
The curing process is also quite different than concrete.  Asphalt cures over a period of months and even years, depending on sun exposure and other factors in the environment.  Asphalt pavement will remain soft during this time and is susceptible to wheel-rashing and other scarring of the surface. Once the asphalt cures, this surface scarring becomes unnoticeable.  Asphalt pavement typically lasts between 10 and 15 years and after its useful life it can be overlaid with a fresh layer of asphalt. For more information, click here to go to The Asphalt Contractors Association of Florida where you will find useful articles, links, and other resources.
