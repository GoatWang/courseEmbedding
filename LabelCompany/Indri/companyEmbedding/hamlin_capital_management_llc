History





Hamlin Capital Management was founded in 2001 when Mark Stitzer combined forces with the founder of our predecessor firm, with whom Mark and his family had invested for more than a decade. The name Hamlin was taken from a town near Scranton, Pennsylvania, where partners shared origins. Hamlin Capital Management was founded on the belief that compounding income is a better way to preserve purchasing power, reduce volatility, and grow capital relative to the myriad of investment strategies and products that have beguiled institutions and individuals over recent decades. With a longstanding appreciation of the opportunity for anyone to succeed in America if they are devoted to hard work, integrity, and building relationships of trust, Hamlin employees are committed to fair dealing, rigorous analysis, and teamwork. Humbled by our clients’ confidence, we pledge to guard their hard-earned capital as if it were our own.

Investment Philosophy





We believe an investment is something that pays you to own it. Hamlin is dedicated to income generation, an enduring strategy for wealth preservation and long-term capital appreciation. We think a portfolio should operate like a good business: good businesses generate cash flow for their owners. We believe that income-oriented portfolios afford options for individual and institutional investors, allowing them to reinvest for growth or to extract cash to support lifestyles and meet financial commitments. We focus on after-tax returns for our individual accounts both with respect to the taxation of portfolio income and the timing of capital gains and losses.




We think that a portfolio should operate like a good business: good businesses generate cash flow for their owners.



We are fundamental, value-oriented, long-only money managers. Our investment horizon is measured in years, not quarters. We believe that clients deserve continual access to their capital, and do not espouse lock-up provisions. We do not believe in performance or incentive fees, nor do we employ leverage. While we are proud of our process, discipline and team, we believe that our investment results reflect the power of our chosen strategy more than the talent of individual Hamlin investment professionals. As Albert Einstein reportedly said, “Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world… the greatest mathematical discovery of our time.”

Investor Profile





Hamlin believes that income-generating portfolios harness the power of compound income, reduce volatility, and provide cash flow to meet obligations. In our opinion, income-oriented portfolios deserve a role in almost every investor’s financial plan. We manage money for municipal pension plans, Taft Hartley retirement plans, endowments, foundations, and high net worth individuals. Our investment services may be appropriate for:

Investors seeking tax-advantaged income and long term capital appreciation
Retirees in search of current income with some appreciation to keep pace with inflation
IRA and qualified plan owners funding required minimum distribution and seeking some appreciation
Nonprofit institutions and endowments whose operating budgets and mandate depend on income
Trustees that want to satisfy beneficiaries needing current income and seeking long-term capital appreciation
Pension plans seeking high current income and long term capital appreciation





     We believe income-generating portfolios deserve a role in almost every investor’s financial plan.

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”

We believe in the American way — opportunity for all.







OVERVIEW
The Hamlin High Dividend Equity Fund (the “Fund”) seeks high current income and long-term capital appreciation. In pursuing the Fund’s investment objective, Hamlin Capital Management, LLC (the “Adviser”), the Fund’s adviser, seeks to identify and invest Fund assets in dividend-paying equity securities of companies that, in the Adviser’s opinion, are undervalued in the market.
STRATEGY
The Fund may invest in companies of any market capitalizations range, although the Adviser expects to invest Fund assets mostly in mid and large capitalization companies. The Fund will generally invest in equity securities of domestic companies, but may invest in equity securities of foreign companies and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”).
MINIMUM INVESTMENT
The following are the minimum investment requirements of our no load mutual funds. While it is no load, there may still be expenses associated with the fund:


Hamlin High Dividend Equity Fund (Investor Shares): $2,500
Hamlin High Dividend Equity Fund (Institutional Shares): $100,000



The Hamlin Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO) which is not affiliated with Hamlin Capital Management, LLC or any other affiliate. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck
Mutual fund investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that the portfolio will achieve its stated objectives. Bond and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise. A company may reduce or eliminate its dividend, causing losses to the fund. International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, differences in generally accepted accounting principals, or from social economic, or political instability in other nations.
To determine if the fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the fund's summary and full prospectus. Read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
