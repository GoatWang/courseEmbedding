BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, July 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- IRSA Propiedades Comerciales S.A. ("IRSA CP")  announced today the launch of its global public offering of 14,000,000 newly-issued common shares, par value Ps.1.00 per share, which will be represented by American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") in the United States and other countries outside Argentina through a group of international underwriters and in Argentina by several placement agents pursuant to a Spanish-language prospectus prepared for the Argentine offering. In addition, 14,000,000 common shares are being offered by IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima ("IRSA") as selling shareholder. The total number of common shares offered for sale in the global offering is subject to reallocation between the international and Argentine offerings. IRSA CP expects that the common shares will be offered at a price between US$50.00 and US$60.00 per ADS or US$12.50 and US$15.00 per common share.








IRSA has granted an option to the international underwriters for a period of 30 days following the date of pricing of the global offering to purchase up to an additional 1,050,000 ADSs, representing 4,200,000 common shares, at the public offering price per ADS paid by investors in the global offering, minus underwriting discounts and commissions, to cover over-allotments, if any.
Additionally, IRSA's Board of Directors has authorized the increase of the size of the offering in an amount up to 8,000,000 common shares (plus an option of an additional 1,200,000 common shares to the international underwriters to cover over-allotments, if any), depending on market conditions.
Prior to this offering, the public market for IRSA CP's common shares and ADSs has been limited. IRSA CP's ADSs are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market and the common shares are listed on Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos S.A. ("BYMA"), in each case, under the symbol ''IRCP". On July 5, 2017, the closing price per common share on the BYMA was Ps.240.00 and the closing price per ADS on the NASDAQ was US$56.90.
IRSA CP intends to use the net proceeds received from this global offering to: finance the growth of its business through the development of commercial rental properties; develop, re-style and expand existing commercial properties; to acquire new commercial properties; to purchase additional land reserves; and for other general corporate purposes. IRSA CP will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares or ADRs by IRSA, nor from the exercise by the international underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by IRSA.
A registration statement, including a prospectus, which is preliminary and subject to completion, relating to these securities has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective, and, even then, the securities may only be sold pursuant to the registration statement and final prospectus. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Morgan Securities LLC will act as the sole global coordinator, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Itau BBA USA Securities Inc. will act as joint book-running managers and Banco BTG Pactual S.A.— Cayman Branch will act as junior bookrunner. A copy of the preliminary prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from J.P.

Al 30 de junio de 2016, éramos operadores y titulares de participaciones mayoritarias en una cartera de 16 centros comerciales en la Argentina, siete de los cuales están ubicados en la CABA (Abasto, Alcorta Shopping, Alto Palermo Shopping, Patio Bullrich, Buenos Aires Design, Dot Baires Shopping y Distrito Arcos), dos en el Gran Buenos Aires (Alto Avellaneda y Soleil Premium Outlet) y el resto se encuentra ubicado en diferentes provincias de la Argentina (Alto Noa en la Ciudad de Salta, Alto Rosario en la Ciudad de Rosario, Mendoza Plaza en la Ciudad de Mendoza, Córdoba Shopping Villa Cabrera y Patio Olmos (operado por una tercera parte) en la Ciudad de Córdoba, La Ribera Shopping en Santa Fe (a través de un negocio conjunto) y Alto Comahue en la Ciudad de Neuquén).
Los centros comerciales que operamos comprenden un total de 333.155,4 m2 de ABL (excluyendo ciertos espacios ocupados por hipermercados, los cuales no son nuestros locatarios). Las ventas totales de los locatarios de nuestros centros comerciales, según datos informados por los comercios, fueron de Ps. 28.904,9 millones para el ejercicio fiscal de 2016 y de Ps. 21.527,0 millones para el ejercicio fiscal 2015, lo cual implica un incremento del 34,3%, incluyendo Distrito Arcos y Alto Comahue. Las ventas de los locatarios de nuestros centros comerciales son relevantes para nuestros ingresos y rentabilidad porque son uno de los factores que determinan el monto del alquiler que podemos cobrar a nuestros locatarios. También afectan los costos globales de ocupación de los locatarios como porcentaje de sus ventas.

Manufacturing & Construction Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The Manufacturing sector covers work performed in mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products also falls under Manufacturing unless the activity is appropriately classified in Construction.
The Construction sector primarily covers work performed in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems). 
	 Companies that perform work in the preparation of sites for new construction and those involved subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in Construction.

Manufacturing uses raw materials that are products of agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or quarrying, as well as products of other manufacturing operations. Plants, factories, or mills that characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment, transform the raw materials into new finished products or components of products that require further manufacturing.

Construction markets include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these enterprises generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities are specified contractually with construction project owners (prime contractors) or contracts with other construction companies (subcontractors).

Construction companies that contract responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but are also markets known as design-build, construction management, turnkey contracting, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contracting. Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as

You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as "believes" and "expects." Forward-looking statements are based on IRSA CP's current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in IRSA CP's filings with the SEC, including IRSA CP's registration statement on Form F-1, as amended from time to time, under the caption "Risk Factors."
