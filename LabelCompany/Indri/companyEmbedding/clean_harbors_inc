	About Us







Company Overview
Clean Harbors is North America’s leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services. The Company serves a diverse customer base, including a majority of the Fortune 500 companies, across the chemical, energy, manufacturing and additional markets, as well as numerous government agencies. These customers rely on Clean Harbors to deliver a broad range of services such as end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency spill response, industrial cleaning and maintenance, and recycling services. Through its Safety-Kleen subsidiary, Clean Harbors also is North America’s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services to commercial, industrial and automotive customers. Founded in 1980 and based in Massachusetts, Clean Harbors operates throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
Clean Harbors' Vision
"To be recognized as the premier provider of environmental, energy and industrial services."

Clean Harbors operates four businesses:

Technical Services provides a broad range of vertically integrated hazardous and not-hazardous material management services. These include collection, packaging, transportation, recycling, treatment, and disposal services, which are offered at Company-owned recycling, incineration, landfill, wastewater, and other treatment facilities. Clean Harbors operates more than 100 disposal facilities.
Safety-Kleen, acquired by Clean Harbors in December 2012, provides used oil collection, recycling and re-refining, parts washing and other environmental services for the small quantity generator market. Safety-Kleen’s closed-loop environmental solutions enable customers to effectively manage their waste streams, capturing economic advantages through reduced costs and the sale of recovered products.
Industrial and Field Services provides industrial and specialty services. These include high-pressure and chemical cleaning, decoking, and material processing, supported by its lodging operations in Western Canada. Industrial and Field Services also consists of a wide variety of environmental cleanup services, including tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation and spill cleanup.

Product Destruction
Jump to navigation



Product Destruction, handled by Clean Harbors Product Disposal Services, provides the collection, packaging, and disposal of damaged, out-of-date, expired or recalled products.  Our product destruction capabilities coupled with our logistical support, allow you to work with one company to handle 100% of the transportation and disposal of your unwanted consumer products.
Damaged and Discarded Goods
Clean Harbors safely and routinely handles product destruction for items that need to be discarded due to shelf life expiration or damages.  Our specialists collect, sort, package, manifest, transport and dispose of these consumer products to prevent them from entering the market.  If the retail store opts to package the damaged goods themselves, we can provide the packing materials, supplies and containers.  We handle product destruction for items such as aerosol cans, laundry detergent, lighter fluids, ammunition, toys, cosmetics, perfumes, flammable goods, garden supplies, oils, engine fluids, parts cleaners, just to name a few.
Depending on your product destruction requirements, we can provide landfill disposal for non-hazardous items at a lower cost than incineration.  We can also provide cost-effective incineration, fuel blending and aqueous treatment for both hazardous and non-hazardous product destruction.
Recall Management
Clean Harbors collects and manages unsafe, hazardous or defective products that are being recalled or discontinued so they will not be misused or end up on the wrong hands.  If the retail store opts to package the discontinued or recalled products themselves, we can provide the packing materials, supplies and containers. We collect, sort, package, manifest, transport and manage all product destruction and product disposal in compliance with local, state, provincial and federal regulations. 
Shredding Services
Customers often generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that contain sensitive information, trade secrets, or packing and labeling which have their company name or trademark on them. Clean Harbors’ shredding technology guarantees our customers that their waste products will be completely defaced prior to disposal and that they cannot be pilfered, reused or resold once shredded.
Read more about our Shredding Services.
Witness Destruction of Sensitive or Classified Material
Clean Harbors offers Witness Destruction Services for sensitive, classified or high profile products.  From secure shipment through final product disposal, Clean Harbors has the necessary controls and processes for secure and complete product destruction.  We also offer witness slot availability for those customers who do not want their non-saleable items to remain in inventory for any period of time and require immediate processing upon receipt.

History[edit]
Clean Harbors, Inc. was founded in 1980 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[4][5] a Boston suburb, by Alan S. McKim, who continues as the company’s CEO and Chairman. The company had one truck and four employees who transported and disposed of hazardous wastes for local businesses. It soon began adding larger corporate accounts and grew to 18 employees and $1.5 million in revenues by the end of its second year. In year three its revenue increased to $4.2 million and 34 employees.
Clean Harbors expanded to offer emergency hazardous waste cleaning services and industrial waste disposal, as well as ongoing management of hazardous material sites. Revenues continued to climb approaching $50 million in 1986.
Expansion and diversification[edit]
Clean Harbors held its initial public offering (IPO) offering of one million shares at $9 a share on the NASDAQ on November 24, 1987. Six months later Clean Harbors' stock had risen from $9 to more than $15. The company made a secondary offering at the higher share price. After the two tranches Alan McKim retained about 60 percent ownership of Clean Harbors. Going public set the stage for expansion. Clean Harbors, still solely an environmental services company, purchased Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) certified hazardous waste incinerators in Arkansas, Nebraska, Ontario, Quebec, Texas and Utah, which it continues to own and operate to this day.
During this time Clean Harbors also developed its emergency response capabilities. Its first project came in 1984 when it removed oil from a tanker, which foundered off Cape Cod in a snowstorm. It participated in several cleanup projects in New England and expanded to respond to emergencies outside of the region as well as handling industrial and land-based cleanup and transportation projects.
During this time the company also greatly expanded its services for the industrial and chemical industry sectors. These services focused on collecting, packing and disposing of industrial and research laboratory and production chemicals, many of which were disposed of through Clean Harbors' expanding network of RCRA-certified landfills and incinerators. In 1998, Clean Harbors Industrial Services was established as a division to handle in-plant cleaning and maintenance services, including chemical cleaning, vacuuming, steam cleaning and hydroblasting of chemical processing equipment.
Over the years Clean Harbors has continued to expand through organic growth and approximately 35 acquisitions. Most of the acquisitions were relatively small compared to Clean Harbors’ overall revenues. Major acquisitions, such as Eveready, Inc., Peak Energy Services, Safety-Kleen and Teris LLC, substantially added to the company’s assets and broadened its service lines to include industrial and energy services, solvent recovery/recycling, lodging and oilfield and environmental dewatering technologies. Today, Clean Harbors has a substantial presence in oil and gas oilfields and refinery operations and used oil recycling and re-refining while maintaining and growing its environmental and industrial services business lines.
Acquisitions timetable[edit]
Over the years Clean Harbors has completed the purchase of more than 35 companies or substantial divisions of companies. Early investments from Clean Harbors’ founding until 2009 were primarily in the environmental services, waste management and industrial services areas. It made its first major acquisition in the oil and gas area in 2009 and has since further expanded in that sector through organic growth and acquisitions.
Significant acquisitions include:[6]

1989 – Chem Clear Inc. (Aqueous waste treatment with facilities in Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland) First major acquisition outside of New England.
1995 – Kimball Incinerator Facility (Waste incinerator facility from Ecova Corp.) First RCRA-certified incinerator.
2002 – Chemical Services Division of Safety-Kleen (55 service centers and 33 waste management facilities) Significantly expanded Clean Harbors' chemical and waste disposal services.
2007 – Teris LLC (Incinerator and treatment, storage and disposal facilities) Extended Clean Harbors’ reach to California.
2008 – Safety-Kleen Solvent Recycling Division and Universal Environmental (Solvent recycling facilities in Chicago and Hebron, Ohio) Gave Clean Harbors a significant position in solvent recycling.
2009 – Eveready Inc. (Industrial maintenance and production, lodging and seismic services primarily for the oil and gas industry) significantly expanded energy and industrial services and provided a major presence in Canada.
2011 – Peak Energy Services (Oil and gas surface rentals for liquid, solid and sludge processing) Added new capabilities to Clean Harbors oilfield services.
2012 – Safety-Kleen (Used oil recycling and re-refining, and parts washers) The $1.25 billion purchase added small generator market resources and significantly expanded the company.

Finance[edit]
On May 20, 2003, Clean Harbors revised previously announced treatment of the non-cash cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 from a $34 million non-cash tax effected gain, to a reduction of the purchased value assigned to the CSD assets of $46.5 million.[7]
On March 15, 2005. Clean Harbors, Inc. announced to restate financial statements for the years 2003 and 2002, and financial information for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999, to correct errors relating to the methodology it had established for estimating self-insured workers' compensation and motor vehicle liability claims.[8]

Clean Harbors, Inc. is a provider of environmental, energy and industrial services, including hazardous waste disposal for companies, including Fortune 500 companies, small waste generators and federal, state, provincial and local governments.
The company has expanded through organic growth and acquisitions to approximately 400 service locations in North America including over 50 hazardous waste management facilities in 38 U.S. states, seven Canadian provinces, Mexico and Puerto Rico.[2]
The company is included in the S&P 400 mid-cap index and the S&P 1500 composite index.[3]

History[edit]
Clean Harbors, Inc. was founded in 1980 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[4][5] a Boston suburb, by Alan S. McKim, who continues as the company’s CEO and Chairman. The company had one truck and four employees who transported and disposed of hazardous wastes for local businesses. It soon began adding larger corporate accounts and grew to 18 employees and $1.5 million in revenues by the end of its second year. In year three its revenue increased to $4.2 million and 34 employees.
Clean Harbors expanded to offer emergency hazardous waste cleaning services and industrial waste disposal, as well as ongoing management of hazardous material sites. Revenues continued to climb approaching $50 million in 1986.
Expansion and diversification[edit]
Clean Harbors held its initial public offering (IPO) offering of one million shares at $9 a share on the NASDAQ on November 24, 1987. Six months later Clean Harbors' stock had risen from $9 to more than $15. The company made a secondary offering at the higher share price. After the two tranches Alan McKim retained about 60 percent ownership of Clean Harbors. Going public set the stage for expansion. Clean Harbors, still solely an environmental services company, purchased Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) certified hazardous waste incinerators in Arkansas, Nebraska, Ontario, Quebec, Texas and Utah, which it continues to own and operate to this day.
During this time Clean Harbors also developed its emergency response capabilities. Its first project came in 1984 when it removed oil from a tanker, which foundered off Cape Cod in a snowstorm. It participated in several cleanup projects in New England and expanded to respond to emergencies outside of the region as well as handling industrial and land-based cleanup and transportation projects.
During this time the company also greatly expanded its services for the industrial and chemical industry sectors. These services focused on collecting, packing and disposing of industrial and research laboratory and production chemicals, many of which were disposed of through Clean Harbors' expanding network of RCRA-certified landfills and incinerators. In 1998, Clean Harbors Industrial Services was established as a division to handle in-plant cleaning and maintenance services, including chemical cleaning, vacuuming, steam cleaning and hydroblasting of chemical processing equipment.
Over the years Clean Harbors has continued to expand through organic growth and approximately 35 acquisitions. Most of the acquisitions were relatively small compared to Clean Harbors’ overall revenues. Major acquisitions, such as Eveready, Inc., Peak Energy Services, Safety-Kleen and Teris LLC, substantially added to the company’s assets and broadened its service lines to include industrial and energy services, solvent recovery/recycling, lodging and oilfield and environmental dewatering technologies. Today, Clean Harbors has a substantial presence in oil and gas oilfields and refinery operations and used oil recycling and re-refining while maintaining and growing its environmental and industrial services business lines.
Acquisitions timetable[edit]
Over the years Clean Harbors has completed the purchase of more than 35 companies or substantial divisions of companies. Early investments from Clean Harbors’ founding until 2009 were primarily in the environmental services, waste management and industrial services areas. It made its first major acquisition in the oil and gas area in 2009 and has since further expanded in that sector through organic growth and acquisitions.
Significant acquisitions include:[6]

1989 – Chem Clear Inc. (Aqueous waste treatment with facilities in Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland) First major acquisition outside of New England.
1995 – Kimball Incinerator Facility (Waste incinerator facility from Ecova Corp.) First RCRA-certified incinerator.
2002 – Chemical Services Division of Safety-Kleen (55 service centers and 33 waste management facilities) Significantly expanded Clean Harbors' chemical and waste disposal services.
2007 – Teris LLC (Incinerator and treatment, storage and disposal facilities) Extended Clean Harbors’ reach to California.
2008 – Safety-Kleen Solvent Recycling Division and Universal Environmental (Solvent recycling facilities in Chicago and Hebron, Ohio) Gave Clean Harbors a significant position in solvent recycling.
2009 – Eveready Inc. (Industrial maintenance and production, lodging and seismic services primarily for the oil and gas industry) significantly expanded energy and industrial services and provided a major presence in Canada.
2011 – Peak Energy Services (Oil and gas surface rentals for liquid, solid and sludge processing) Added new capabilities to Clean Harbors oilfield services.
2012 – Safety-Kleen (Used oil recycling and re-refining, and parts washers) The $1.25 billion purchase added small generator market resources and significantly expanded the company.

Finance[edit]
On May 20, 2003, Clean Harbors revised previously announced treatment of the non-cash cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 from a $34 million non-cash tax effected gain, to a reduction of the purchased value assigned to the CSD assets of $46.5 million.[7]
On March 15, 2005. Clean Harbors, Inc. announced to restate financial statements for the years 2003 and 2002, and financial information for the years 2001, 2000, and 1999, to correct errors relating to the methodology it had established for estimating self-insured workers' compensation and motor vehicle liability claims.[8]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
