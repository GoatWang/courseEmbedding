Overview
Fact Sheet
Working with ARCH
Yellowstone Volunteers






Pioneering Strategies for Technology Commercialization

	ARCH Venture Partners invests in the development of seed and early stage 
	advanced technology companies that have the potential to grow rapidly into 
	successful businesses. We invest primarily in companies we co-found with leading 
	scientists and entrepreneurs, concentrating on bringing to market disruptive 
	innovations in life sciences, physical sciences and information technology, and 
	specialize in the spaces where they converge.

	We enjoy special recognition as a leader in the successful commercialization of 
	technologies developed at academic research institutions, corporate research 
	groups and national laboratories.

Before the Buzzwords

	Our team has deep scientific bench strength to locate and understand nascent 
	technologies long before they grow to become the popular industries of the day. 
	Our first nanotechnology investment was in 1989 (Nanophase Technologies) … our 
	first gene therapy and vaccine investments in 1992 (GenVec and Aviron) … our first 
	digital biology company was founded in 1993 (Illumina) … our first cleantech 
	company in 1994 (Eichrom Technologies) … and our first social networking investment 
	in 1996 (Classmates.com). The buzzwords hadn’t been formed yet, but the science, the 
	technology and the opportunities were all sound.

Partnering Excellence

	ARCH has worked with exceptional entrepreneurs as well as academic and industry 
	partners to build more than 180 companies. Among the ARCH-funded companies that 
	are now public firms or were acquired are VBI Vaccines, Pulmatrix, Chiasma, 
	Bellerophon Therapeutics, Juno Therapeutics, Illumina, Aviron, Alnylam 
	Pharmaceuticals, Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Receptos, Agios Pharmaceuticals, 
	Sage Therapeutics, BIND Therapeutics, Fate Therapeutics, Bluebird Bio, 
	Achaogen, Ikaria, Crystal IS, Nanophase Technologies, deCODE Genetics, 
	Celebrate Express, Kotura, NeurogesX, Caliper Life Sciences, Classmates.com, XenoPort, New 
	Era of Networks, Trubion Pharmaceuticals, GenVec, Array BioPharma, Ahura Scientific,
	ALIS, MicroOptical Devices, Adolor, Everyday Learning, Innovalight, and R2 Technology.

Your Bridge to Success
Arch Partners LLC is a team of successful entrepreneur-investors who utilize their expertise in “go to market” strategy and execution, intellectual property knowledge, capital structure, and exit strategies to build and realize value for the owners of their portfolio companies.
Similar to an angel or venture capital investor, Arch Partners makes an investment in the selected portfolio company. However, an Arch Partners investment is comprised of a significant amount of direct involvement by the partners, as well as personal capital. Whereas a typical angel or venture capital investor will invest only money and board-level advice while placing the responsibility for strategy and execution on its portfolio company, Arch Partners helps to formulate and execute the business plan and has significant involvement with much of the execution: three parts partner involvement to one part capital contribution. The end result: all parties contribute their domain expertise to the joint objective — success for the portfolio company.







Comments are closed.




 
Arch Partners was founded by a team of successful entrepreneur-investors to bridge their expertise in product commercialization with entrepreneurs seeking to realize significant value from proven technologies.
