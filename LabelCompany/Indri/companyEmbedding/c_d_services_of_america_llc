More than 9.5 million service calls and repairs successfully handled“I had Raul Noya Carmejo out today to service my air conditioner unit, which I had purchased last year from Service America. He has been out to my house in the past and I just wanted to let his supervisors know that once again he was professional, courteous and addressed my issues perfectly. He represents Service America well and is one of the many reasons why I have been with Service America at this property for 13 years and my condo in Tamarac for over 23 years.”  - Neal

How do I get an original release of lien from DC Financial Services of America?

I need an original release of lien from DC Financial Services of America, LLC and they no longer exist.  They provided me with a title that showed the release, but I have misplaced it and cannot get a new title from the State of Texas without this document.  I contacted the dealer who told me that he thought that TD Finance had taken over everything when DC ceased to exist.   I need the title in order to sell the car.  Can anyone please help?

Thanks for reaching us on TD Helps, Kimberly.  We'd be glad to point you in the right direction.

As our friend LiShu mentioned above, you would need to reach out to TD Auto Finance in regards to a lien release.  Please use the telephone numbers she mentions to do so.  

TD Bank and TD Auto Finance share the same TD Shield however we're only affiliates.  Because of this, we do not share loan account information between our two entities.  

Thanks again for visiting us, Kimberly and have a good day.

In reply to WALTER, GILBERT
Thanks for coming to TD Helps for your answer today, Walter. We'll be happy to help!

The information you will need in order to receive a Lien Release depends on if your loan is held with TD Bank, or TD Auto Finance. While we both share the same TD shield, please note that we are two different entities. 

If your auto loan was held with TD Bank and it's been paid off, to obtain a release form, a fax is required. Please note that the loan account holder must send this request. Please fax the following information to our Consumer Release Department at 207-755-4245:

· Account holder's full name, address.

· The account number, if it's available, if not then Social Security number.

· The year, make, model, VIN, and the date it was paid off, if available

· Your request for Discharge Papers / Release of Lien Your Signature

· Please also include information as to where we should send or fax the documents to

We also recommend including your best contact number and your return fax number so that we can assist you as efficiently as possible. Please keep in mind that the turnaround time for the request is typically 3-5 business days.

Please note, if a third party is requesting this copy on behalf of our customer, their signed authorization agreeing to release this information to you will also be needed. Kindly include this document with your fax.

If you prefer, you're also welcome to give us a call to place your request. Our Financial Solutions Group Specialists are available, 24/7, at 800-937-5020. Once on the phone with a Specialist, they will be happy to take your request by phone and have this documentation mailed out to you at the address you have on file. If you'll be receiving the release of lien paperwork via mail, please allow additional time for mailing, typically a 5-7 day turnaround.

However, if your auto loan was financed via TD Auto Finance, and not TD Bank, please contact a TD Auto Finance Representative for instructions to obtain your release of lien. They are available Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM, and Saturday, 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM, at 800-556-8172 to help you.

We hope this information is helpful Walter. Enjoy the rest of your day!
