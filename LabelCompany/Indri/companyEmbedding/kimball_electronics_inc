History




Fact Sheet




Mission




Vision & Strategy




Our Guiding Principles




Global Facilities









Kimball Electronics was established in 1961 as the Jasper Electronics Manufacturing Company to build electronic organs for our then parent company, Jasper Corporation. Jasper Corporation later became Kimball International. During the late 1960's contract manufacturing began with the first Industrial contract from General Electric Appliances of Louisville, KY. As the electronics industry evolved, and Kimball expanded, Kimball Electronics did as well.
During the 1980's we became focused solely on contract electronic manufacturing services and expanded into the Automotive, Medical, and Public Safety markets and eventually became known as Kimball Electronics Group. Since that time, it has been our mission to be a worldwide Electronics Manufacturing Service Industry leader in providing superior services and technology while growing profitably. On October 31, 2014, Kimball Electronics was spun-off from parent company Kimball International and became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ Global Select stock exchange under the Kimball Electronics name and symbol KE.
Today, Kimball Electronics is a leading contract manufacturer of durable goods electronics serving a variety of industries on a global scale. Kimball Electronics continues to make the customer the focus of everything we do and will continue to provide the highest industry quality through continuous improvement.

Kimball Electronics, Inc.

Kimball Electronics offers complete product life cycle support for electronic manufacturing assemblies in the Medical, Industrial, Automotive, and Public Safety market segments.


Contract Manufacturer



Kimball Electronics was established in 1961 as the Jasper Electronics Manufacturing Company to build electronic organs for our then parent company, Jasper Corporation. Jasper Corporation later became Kimball International. During the late 1960's contract manufacturing began with the first Industrial contract from General Electric Appliances of Louisville, KY. As the electronics industry evolved, and Kimball expanded, Kimball Electronics did as well.
During the 1980's we became focused solely on contract electronic manufacturing services and expanded into the Automotive, Medical, and Public Safety markets and eventually became known as Kimball Electronics Group. Since that time, it has been our mission to be a worldwide Electronics Manufacturing Service Industry leader in providing superior services and technology while growing profitably. On October 31, 2014, Kimball Electronics was spun-off from parent company Kimball International and became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ Global Select stock exchange under the Kimball Electronics name and symbol KE.
Today, Kimball Electronics is a leading contract manufacturer of durable goods electronics serving a variety of industries on a global scale. Kimball Electronics continues to make the customer the focus of everything we do and will continue to provide the highest industry quality through continuous improvement.

In fact, when evaluating solutions for lower volume and higher mix products typically found in the medical, industrial and public safety segments of the OEM market, IL & DL costs are only one subset of the total cost to land the product and service the ultimate customer.
In this paper, there will be examination of what actual cost components should be included in a landed cost analysis, the soft costs that an OEM should consider to deliver outstanding performance in quality, logistics and delivery management of the supply chain solution. A detailed comparison using a 'case study' will be presented to demonstrate a total landed cost option versus one that is focused on IL/DL cost....
