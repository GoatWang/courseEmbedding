Alternative Thinking 1Q 2017: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes


Topic:
Asset Allocation, Portfolio Management



This issue of Capital Market Assumptions updates our multi-year expected returns for major asset classes. Compared to historical averages, we are still very much in a world of low expected returns.
In this year’s edition, we modify our equity expected return methodologies to account for the growing corporate substitution of share buybacks for dividends. The topic is explored in greater depth in an Appendix which discusses specific details and presents the underlying theory and practical guidance on the data required to build these estimates.

Superstar Investors Webinar | December 13, 2016


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch are some of the most well-known investors of our time, but there has been little empirical analysis to explain their performance. In this webinar, Jordan Brooks and Dan Villalon examine the track records of these “superstars” from a factor perspective to see if their investment philosophies — applied systematically — can help demystify their long-term alpha.

Alternative Thinking 4Q 2016: Superstar Investors


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Many famous investors are outspoken about their investment philosophies, and carefully apply them to a select number of securities. In this Alternative Thinking, we seek to apply their wisdom systematically; to ask whether their philosophies applied broadly might still generate “alpha”.
Our analysis suggests there are many ways to achieve long-run investment success. The takeaway for investors is to identify structural edges and commit to seeing them through inevitable periods of underperformance. As each of our superstars shows, “merely good” edges over time may compound to great long-term performance.

Academic Engagement







What does it take to pursue exceptional results? And to sustain them for the long term?
It takes the right people fostering a culture of debate, innovation and the relentless pursuit of excellence. It takes continual investment in our people, our partners and our investors.

It takes intense curiosity — endless questions about the global financial markets, their behaviors, drivers, signals and truths. It then takes investment hypotheses that resonate with economic rationale and conviction in the power of analysis.

We bring practical application to financial theory, and we are rigorous in our analysis and unyielding in the search for new insights and solutions. What makes sense intuitively, economically? Does the data support the same conclusions? How can the idea be improved, and implemented most efficiently? And how can technology help us apply it? We are driven to find answers.
As a group, we believe in the power of collective intelligence. Insight breeds insight. The more viewpoints, the better. Our team is deeply knowledgeable and experienced and understands how to bring together multiple perspectives through rigorous debate and research to arrive at the best solution.
AQR helps meet the long-term investment goals of pension funds, endowments, foundations and sovereign wealth funds, as well as financial advisors. We are fully committed to sharing our research and insights with the world’s investment community, our clients most of all.

 A Fanatic is One Who Can't Change his Mind and Won't Change the Subject1


July 16, 2017





Topic:
Factor Investing, Portfolio Trading, Style Investing




In his latest whitepaper, Rob Arnott is still repeating things like this: “We point out that some of these factors owe much (or all) of their past efficacy to rising relative valuations.” It’s not a minor assertion but one of his central themes. It was the main topic of the first major paper in his recent wave of “most of the factors are overpriced, data mined, and doomed, save only for the value factor which I still occasionally rename and claim as my own” series, and he returns to it here. 
I have lots of disagreements with Rob on a variety ...

 Still (Not) Crazy After All These Years1


June 14, 2017





Topic:
Equities




With the FANGs (née FAANGs, née FAAMGs) in the news again, for good and bad, we thought it would be a good time to update our analysis that first looked back at 2015. Once again, we find less going on than first meets the eye. Let me try a sports analogy. It’s always interesting to report who won the Super Bowl. But, it’s not at all interesting to report that someone won the Super Bowl. Now, it would indeed be interesting to report if the winning team did something truly outsized like post a 19-0 record for the season. A lot of the reporting of ...

 Virtue is its Own Reward: Or, One Man’s Ceiling is Another Man’s Floor


May 18, 2017





Topic:
ESG




Negative screening is a common application of Environmental/Social/Governance (ESG) investing. It avoids “sin stocks” and divests from industries or firms deemed immoral or having poor or undesirable standards along one of the three E, S or G dimensions.1   It’s promoted largely on the fact that it’s virtuous. While we may all define virtue differently, advocating for it in this way is fair and appropriate. However, employing these constraints is also often promoted as enhancing expected returns. That is, if you avoid certain companies, industries, ...

 Lies, Damned Lies, and Data Mining


April 12, 2017





Topic:
Factor Investing, Style Investing, Data




We are the whipping boy for a recent article on the dangers of data mining in our field. And the whipping is delivered largely based on an unsupported shot taken by my frequent foil and sparring partner, Rob Arnott. Before I take on this attack1  we need to back up a bit.
Data mining, that is searching the data to find in-sample patterns in returns that are not real but random, and then believing you’ve found truth, is a real problem in our field. Random doesn’t tend to repeat so data mining often fails to produce attractive real life returns going forward. And  ...

 Factor Timing is Hard


March 15, 2017





Topic:
Factor Investing, Style Investing




Here is the latest and most exhaustive in our ongoing attempt to ruin the fun for those who think contrarian factor timing is easy and for those who think current factor valuations are extreme, in spite of all of the evidence to the contrary for both.1 
When you write a philippic on something, you generally hope you have put the matter to rest.2  But, my philippic was admittedly designed to be lighter on data (not bereft, just lighter) and heavier on argument. Our latest paper provides a lot of both. Still, much of the basic intuition remains the same. 
I’d sum up ...

 Killed This but Forgot to Stuff Garlic in its Mouth


February 13, 2017





Topic:
Corporate Governance




In this editorial, in the Wall Street Journal no less, two accomplished executives who should know far better argue not to expense stock options for employees making less than $100,000 a year. Why not also ignore the wage expense of these same employees? I will explain. It's obvious idiocy. Ok, maybe I'll explain a bit more. An expense is an expense. If you want to help "inequality," go for it, but do it honestly and directly not by warping the accounting system and bending rules you still (incredibly) object to and would obviously discard in total if allowed (it's obvious  ...

 Betting Against Correlation


February 12, 2017





Topic:
Factor Investing, Style Investing




Our latest paper Betting Against Correlation tries to look deeper into what drives the low-risk effect. In short, we create a new priced factor that helps distinguish between competing, and confounding, stories explaining the efficacy of low-risk investing.
Recall that the low-risk effect is the tendency for low-risk assets to do better than they should versus high-risk assets. That’s a loaded sentence as I haven’t defined risk or how we should measure “better than they should.” When it comes to the low-risk effect, risk has been measured in many ...

 How Much Are You In For?


February 09, 2017





Topic:
Alternative Investing




There is a recent post by Eric Nelson that uses AQR to make one really good point and then to, kind of oddly, pointedly not ask the next logical question. Here I ask and answer that question.
Eric reminds us that what the average investor in a fund gets is different from the return of that fund. That’s true and important. If they get in and out with poor timing they can sabotage themselves. Next, his thesis is that investors in “alternative” funds, funds meant to be diversifying to traditional investments and often using more hedged strategies, are worse ...

 Caveat Investor? The “Fiduciary Rule” and Unintended Consequences


January 16, 2017





Topic:
Portfolio Management




The Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule, which is applicable to retirement plans subject to ERISA such as 401(k) plans and to certain other retirement plans such as IRAs, is set to go into effect in April 2017. What the rule does is extend a fiduciary duty or standard to a broad set of investment advisors (many, particularly at broker-dealers, who were previously exempt) who provide recommendations to such plans. A "fiduciary duty” is the highest standard of care recognized in American law. Among other things it means that you must act solely in the best ...

 2016 Beyond Equities: Still Boring


January 10, 2017





Topic:
Portfolio Management, Risk Management, Factor Investing




Writing my post titled “2016 Was Not a Particularly Volatile Year” on realized risk/variability turned out to be even more fun than usual as I got a lot of great comments on it. Of course, some didn’t buy it. Some said things like “yeah, but you have to admit this or that was crazy,” whatever this or that was. Sometimes I agreed, sometimes I didn’t. We all have a different definition and standard for crazy! By far the most common comment was “ok, you just looked at the S&P 500, what about…?” I can’t look at ...

Alternative Thinking 1Q 2017: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes


Topic:
Asset Allocation, Portfolio Management



This issue of Capital Market Assumptions updates our multi-year expected returns for major asset classes. Compared to historical averages, we are still very much in a world of low expected returns.
In this year’s edition, we modify our equity expected return methodologies to account for the growing corporate substitution of share buybacks for dividends. The topic is explored in greater depth in an Appendix which discusses specific details and presents the underlying theory and practical guidance on the data required to build these estimates.

Superstar Investors Webinar | December 13, 2016


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch are some of the most well-known investors of our time, but there has been little empirical analysis to explain their performance. In this webinar, Jordan Brooks and Dan Villalon examine the track records of these “superstars” from a factor perspective to see if their investment philosophies — applied systematically — can help demystify their long-term alpha.

Alternative Thinking 4Q 2016: Superstar Investors


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Many famous investors are outspoken about their investment philosophies, and carefully apply them to a select number of securities. In this Alternative Thinking, we seek to apply their wisdom systematically; to ask whether their philosophies applied broadly might still generate “alpha”.
Our analysis suggests there are many ways to achieve long-run investment success. The takeaway for investors is to identify structural edges and commit to seeing them through inevitable periods of underperformance. As each of our superstars shows, “merely good” edges over time may compound to great long-term performance.
