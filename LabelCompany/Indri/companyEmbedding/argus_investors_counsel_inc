            Our Core Equity strategy seeks to outperform the S&P 500 benchmark by 200 to 300 basis points through a market cycle of 3-5 years while maintaining a low tracking error of 3-4%. Our process attempts to achieve this goal by constructing a core portfolio of approximately 50 long term holdings to create a portfolio that
            has a more efficient risk reward profile and greater diversification than the output of conventional capitalization weighted index strategies.

Argus Investors' Counsel












Argus Investors' Counsel Inc.

Argus Investors' Counsel (AIC) is the investment management arm of Argus Research Group. AIC specializes in discretionary, separate account, equity investment management for institutional and private investors. Our clients include corporations, public and private pension funds, Taft Hartley organizations, foundations, endowments, and high net-worth individuals. Argus Investors' Counsel was founded in 1960.  
AIC’s defining qualities come from the tenure and experience of the investment team, as well as from the substantial research resources of Argus Research.

AIC’s Core Equity strategy seeks to outperform the S&P 500 benchmark by 200 to 300 basis points through a market cycle of 3-5 years while maintaining a low tracking error of 3%-4%. The process attempts to achieve this goal by constructing a core portfolio of approximately 50 long-term holdings to create a portfolio that has a more efficient risk reward profile and greater diversification than the output of conventional capitalization weighted index strategies. 
The advantages of the Core Strategy include:


Predictability: Produce dependable, repeatable returns that are systematic and do not rely on short term forecast of earnings or economic trends.
Risk Management: Strict equal weighting and ongoing rebalancing manages individual stock and industry risks.
Downside Protection: Our process maintains true diversification and has produced valuable downside protection in declining market environments.

 Career History



Chief Investment Strategist

                                    Current                


Argus Investors' Counsel, Inc.


                  Argus Investors' Counsel invests in diversified, US-listed, large-cap equities. Using a bottom-up stock selection process, broad portfolio diversification is achieved by making equally weighted investments in one established, financially strong, leading company in 40 to 55 different industries. Argus' investment approach may be characterized as an 'investing' as opposed to a 'trading' approach with a long-term investment horizon.Their Core Equity strategy seeks to outperform the S&P 500 benchmark by 200 to 300 basis points through a market cycle of 3-5 years while maintaining a low tracking error of 3-4%. The process attempts to achieve this goal by constructing a core portfolio of approximately 50 long term holdings to create a portfolio that has a more efficient risk reward profile and greater diversification than the output of conventional capitalization weighted index strategies.The Argus Activist Turnaround Strategy produces a portfolio of deep value stocks which may be poised to rebound because activist investors have built substantial ownership positions in the companies. Activists should represent a catalyst for significant change and subsequently, significant price recovery and appreciation.                




Chief Investment Strategist

                                    Current                


Argus Research Co.


                  Founded in 1934, Argus Research Co. is an independent research firm located in New York City. The firm is a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, Inc. They produce, distribute and market high-quality investment and economic research.Argus employs a 6-point system for analyzing the stocks in their coverage universe. This system is based on a combination of top-down and bottom-up analysis. Argus begins with industry analysis. The first step involves formulating a forecast for the economy and interest rates and then collaborating with industry analysts to determine which industries are expected to perform well over the next 1 to 2 years. Within the industry, an analyst will determine a specific company's competitive position and its prospects. The second step of the process involves growth analysis. Looking forward, Argus forecasts growth in sales, earnings (operating or GAAP), dividends and cash flow for each company by studying growth in individual product lines, margins, industries and the economy. Looking backward, they smooth a company's historical growth rates in numerous metrics including balance sheet items and analyze them versus the company's peers and the market. In their analyses, Argus comments on the quality of a company's earnings. Financial strength analysis is the third step. The firm determines a financial strength rating for each company in their universe of coverage. To assess financial strength, Argus conducts ratio analysis to move beyond the financial statements and into the footnotes of a company's publicly available documents to fully evaluate obligations and opportunities. In this process, they attend meetings, presentations and road shows with senior managers, travel to corporate facilities and participate in conference calls. The fifth step of the firm's process involves risk analysis. Argus considers risk from both a qualitative and quantitative standpoint. On a qualitative basis, they review each company in the context of Harvard Professor Michael Porter's Five Forces model to determine potential threats. On a quantitative basis, they analyze proprietary data from their sister company, Vickers Stock Research, regarding institutional and insider ownership trends. Argus conducts a regression analysis to determine the correlation of a company's stock returns with the market's returns and to determine the predictability of the relationship. They also measure the volatility of key financial statistics such as sales and earnings growth and margins. Finally, Argus determines a fundamental floor for every stock in their universe through the final step in their process which is valuation analysis. The firm first compares a company against its peers on metrics such as p/e rations, price/sales ratios and dividend yields. Secondly, they analyze stock price activity in terms of annual sales, cash flow, dividends, book value, earnings and earnings relative to the S&P500. Argus determines normal ratio ranges for these parameters and then adjusts the ranges going forward. They apply the adjusted ranges to their key sales, earnings and cash flow forecasts to arrive at a normal trading range. Once the range has been determined, Argus uses 2- and 3-stage dividend discount modeling to arrive at a target price, which they believe can be achieved over a 12-month period.
