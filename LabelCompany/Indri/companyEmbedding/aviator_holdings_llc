The aircraft spare parts redistribution market is highly-fragmented.
Competition is generally based on price, availability of product and quality,
including traceability. Our major competitors include AAR Corp., Aero Controls
Corp., Solair, Inc., The Memphis Group and Aviation Sales Company. There is
also substantial competition, both domestically and overseas, from smaller,
independent dealers who generally participate in niche markets. Several of our
competitors have greater financial and other resources.
     The jet turbine engine and jet turbine aircraft market is currently
dominated by various financial institutions, such as GE Capital, CIT Group, and
International Lease Finance Corp. as well as the major competitors from the
spare parts redistribution market. The market also includes many smaller
entities who engage in transactions on an infrequent basis.


Company Description
General

     Aviation Holdings Group is a holding company and currently has no
operations other than the ownership of 96% of the outstanding capital stock of
Aviation Holdings International. Aviation Holdings Group was incorporated in
January 1998 as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned


 subsidiary of EyeQ
Networking, Inc., a Colorado corporation formed in May 1988. In February, 1998,
EyeQ Networking, Inc. merged with and into Aviation Holdings Group, with
Aviation Holdings Group surviving as the newly merged entity under the name of
EyeQ Networking, Inc. In September 1998, Aviation Holdings Group changed its
name from EyeQ Networking, Inc. to Aviation Holdings Group, Inc.

     We acquired approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of Aviation Holdings International through a series of share exchanges in which
holders of Aviation Holdings International common stock exchanged it for
newly-issued shares of Aviation Holdings Group common stock.

     We are in the aircraft and engine spare parts redistribution business and
specialize in the sale, lease, exchange and purchase of technical spare parts
for fixed-wing commercial jet transport aircraft manufactured by Boeing,
McDonnell Douglas, Airbus and Lockheed. As part of this business, we provide
customers with inventory management services including new product
distribution, technical purchasing, maintenance and repair management,
consignment marketing and purchase/leaseback of technical spare parts
inventory. We also pursue opportunities involving the purchase, sale and lease
of jet turbine engines, jet turbine aircraft and related aviation industry
equipment.

Industry Overview

     The aircraft spare parts redistribution market includes sellers of parts
other than parts manufacturers. This market is highly fragmented, with a
limited number of large, well-capitalized companies selling a broad range of
aircraft spare parts and many smaller competitors servicing particular segments
of the aircraft spare parts industry. We believe that significant trends
affecting the aircraft spare parts market will increase our overall size and at
the same time eliminate some market participants and cause consolidation in the
industry due to the inability of some participants to compete efficiently.
These trends are:

Growth in Market for Aircraft Spare Parts

     Boeing's 1999 Market Outlook estimates that:

     o the worldwide fleet of commercial passenger airplanes will more than
       double from 12,600 airplanes at the end of 1998 to 28,400 airplanes by
       2018; and

     o cargo jet aircraft will increase from 1,545 airplanes in 1998 to 3,036
       airplanes by 2018.

Seventy percent of the airplanes delivered to cargo operators are expected to
be used aircraft which were converted from commercial passenger service.
Further, the number of planes in service for more than 10 years is continuing
to increase, and these older planes are the primary market for parts
redistributors. Finally, cost considerations are forcing many airlines and
repair and maintenance facilities to utilize aircraft spare parts sold by
redistributors, instead of purchasing new parts for inventory. We believe that
all of these factors will increase the demand for aircraft spare parts from the
redistribution market.

Increased Outsourcing of Inventory Management Function

     Airlines incur substantial expenditures in connection with fuel, labor and
aircraft ownership. During the last decade, airlines have come under increasing
pressure from consumers to reduce air travel costs. Although some expenditures
required to operate an airline are beyond the direct control of airline
operators (e.g., the price of fuel and labor costs), we believe that obtaining
replacement parts from the redistribution market and outsourcing inventory
management functions are steps airlines will take to manage these functions
with less expense and greater efficiency.


Increasing Emphasis on Traceability

     Due to concerns regarding unapproved aircraft spare parts, regulatory
authorities now require airlines to maintain stricter parts documentation. This
requirement has, in turn, been extended by airlines to the spare parts vendors.
The sophistication required to track the history of an inventory consisting of
thousands of aircraft spare parts is considerable and has required companies to
invest significantly in information systems technology. On March 25, 1999 our
quality control systems were certified by the Airline Suppliers Association as
meeting its quality system standards and FAA guidelines.

Increased Consignment

     Certain of our customers adjust inventory levels on a periodic basis by
disposing of excess aircraft spare parts. Traditionally, larger airlines have
used internal personnel to manage such dispositions. We believe that major
airlines and other owners of aircraft spare parts are increasingly entering
into long-term consignment agreements with redistributors in order to
concentrate on their core businesses and to more effectively redistribute their
excess parts inventories. By consigning inventories to a redistributor such as
us, customers are able to distribute their aircraft spare parts to a larger
number of prospective inventory buyers, allowing the customer to maximize the
value of its inventory. Consignment also enables us to offer for sale
significant parts inventory at minimal capital cost to us.

Increased Leasing

     We believe that cost considerations will cause airlines to lease, rather
than purchase, more spare parts and engines. This would benefit us by:

     o providing a steady income stream over a period of time from lease
       payments;

     o upon termination of the lease, we would regain the part or engine for
       subsequent sale; and

     o provide the opportunity to obtain additional financing.

Operations

     Our core business is buying and selling aircraft and engine spare parts.
We purchase spare parts from numerous unaffiliated sources, including airlines,
original equipment manufacturers and other parts distributors. We have also
pursued opportunities to purchase and sell related aviation industry equipment.
For example, Aviation Holdings International acquired a 50% interest in a DC10
flight simulator and related support package and software. We also provide
value-added inventory management services to our customers. We believe that
inventory management services provide significant opportunities for expansion
of our business in the future. We also intend to develop business as a
redistributor of turbine jet engines and become involved in the purchase, sale
and lease of jet turbine aircraft and engines.

Aircraft and Engine Spare Parts

     Aircraft and engine spare parts can be categorized by their ongoing
ability to be repaired and returned to service. The general categories are as
follows:

     o rotable: means a part which is removed periodically as dictated by an
       operator's maintenance procedures or on an "as needed" basis and is
       typically repaired or overhauled and reused an indefinite number of
       times. An important type of rotable is a "life limited" part, which means
       it has a predetermined designated number of allowable flight hours and/or
       flights after which it is rendered unusable;

     o repairable: means a part limited by the number of times it can be
       repaired before it must be discarded; and

     o expendable: means a part which is used and not thereafter repaired for
       further use.

     Rotable and repairable aircraft and engine spare parts are further
classified as:



     o factory new: means parts that have never been installed or used which are
       purchased from manufacturers or their authorized distributors, aircraft
       manufacturers and engine manufacturers;

     o new surplus: means parts that have never been installed or used which are
       purchased from excess stock of airlines, repair facilities or other
       redistributors;

     o overhauled: means a part that has been completely disassembled,
       inspected, repaired, reassembled and tested by a licensed repair
       facility;

     o serviceable: means a part repaired by an approved maintenance center that
       is functional and meets any manufacturer or time and cycle restrictions
       applicable to it; and

     o as removed: means a part that requires functional testing, repair or
       overhaul by a licensed facility prior to being returned to service in an
       aircraft or engine.


A factory new, new surplus, overhauled or serviceable part designation
indicates that the part can be immediately utilized on an aircraft.

Inventory Purchases and Sales

     Our daily operations encompass inventory sales, brokering and exchanging
aircraft spare parts. We advertise our available inventories held for sale or
exchange on the Inventory Locator Service ("ILS"), the Airline Inventory
Redistribution System ("AIRS") and BCOM electronic databases. Buyers of
aircraft spare parts can access the ILS, AIRS and BCOM databases and determine
the companies which have the desired inventory available. We estimate that 25%
of our daily sales activity results from an ILS, AIRS or BCOM inquiry. All
major airlines and repair agencies subscribe to one or more of these databases
and accordingly, we maintain continual on-line direct access with them. ILS,
AIRS and BCOM do not, however, list price information relating to particular
parts. The ability to properly evaluate and price spare parts and to predict
competitive supply and demand trends derives from management experience in the
industry. We are currently developing an internet web site that will describe
in detail the parts and services we offer.

     We typically have over 50,000 line items in stock. We monitor market
availability, pricing and historical data on a continuous basis. We sell new,
overhauled and serviceable replacement parts from our inventory and buy them at
the request of its customers against a specific order. We usually purchase
parts for our own account and sell them to our customers.

     For the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and the nine months ended
September 30, 1999, Aviation Holdings International's total revenues were
approximately as follows:

  83% from inventory sales;        95% from inventory sales;
  16% from engine sales; and        4% from engine sales; and
   1% from consignment sales.       1% from consignment sales.


Inventory Management Services

     We provide a number of inventory management services to our customers.
These services assist airlines in downsizing their inventory management
operations, thus enabling them to utilize their capital more efficiently and
reduce costs. We believe we can provide an inventory management program geared
to any particular customer's requirements. Such programs would be supported by
our operating agreements with various airlines and independent repair agencies.
We do not charge separately for these services, but consider them to be a
marketing advantage to our inventory sales.

Consignment

     By consigning inventories to a redistributor such as us, consignors are
able to distribute their aircraft spare parts to a larger number of prospective
inventory buyers, allowing the consignor to maximize the value of its
inventory. Consignment also enables us to sell a broad range of parts at
minimal capital cost. We anticipate that revenues from consignment will
increase as a percentage of total revenues in the future.


Purchasing Services

     We purchase spare parts on behalf of smaller and start-up airlines. This
service allows our customers to take advantage of our greater purchasing power,
repair management services, information systems technology, quality and
logistics systems and industry expertise. We do not charge separately for these
services, but consider them to be a marketing tool for our inventory sales.

Asian Operations

     While the majority of our operations are conducted in the United States,
we also operate in Asia and the Pacific Rim directly and through a joint
venture with a third party and a number of subsidiaries. These Asian operations
currently account for approximately 24.7% of our gross revenues on a
consolidated basis and we intend to continue to expand them. The Asian
operations are supervised by Simon Chiang, Vice President for Asia and the
Pacific Rim. From our Miami headquarters, business is conducted through a
number of entities controlled by us that share employees and office facilities.
There are two employees in Hong Kong, one in Shenyang and one in Beijing. The
bulk of the Asian operations consist of business similar to our core operations
in the United States and Europe. We intend to expand the Asian operations to
include other lines of business related to aviation.

     Pasco International Aviation Corp. Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation
("Pasco-HK") and majority-owned subsidiary of Aviation Holdings International,
accounted for approximately 13% and 1% of our gross revenues on a consolidated
basis for the year ended December 31, 1998 and the nine months ended September
30, 1999. The following is a list of some of its major customers: Ameco
Beijing, Air China Group, China Northern Airlines Sanya Branch, China Sandong
Airlines, China Southwest Airlines, China Northwest Airlines, China Shanghai
Airlines, China Airlines-Taiwan, HAECO-HK, Cathay Pacific Airlines and Thai
Airways.

     Shenyang Northern Aircraft Maintenance & Engineering Co., Ltd. is a
Sino-American joint venture company established in November 1997. The joint
venture mainly deals with inspection, repair and recertification of DC9, MD80
and A300-600 components, line replacement units, instruments and avionics. It
also represents some of the world's leading original equipment manufacturers
for certain items. It is the first Sino-foreign joint venture approved by the
Civil Aviation Administration of China in the avionics and accessories repair
field and which commenced operations in March 1998. Twenty-five percent of the
joint venture is held by PASCO International Aviation Corporation, Inc., a
Florida corporation and a subsidiary of Aviation Holdings International
("Pasco-FLA"). China Northern Airlines, one of the largest airlines in China,
holds the remaining 75%. The joint venture is currently certified by the
Chinese aviation authorities and expects to complete FAA certification by the
end of 1999.

     Pasco-FLA's total financial commitment to the joint venture is $1,000,000.
As of September 30, 1999, Aviation Holdings International had funded
approximately $700,000 of this total and intends to fund the remaining
approximately $300,000 with proceeds from this offering and from internal
operations. Under the terms of the joint venture, Pasco-FLA is entitled to
certain preferences in any initial distributions of net income. This preference
provides that Pasco-FLA will recoup its investment prior to any regular
distributions being made to China Northern. Pasco-FLA provides technological
advice to the joint venture and promotes, markets and sells its services. The
joint venture serves approximately 14 airlines. In July 1999, Pasco-FLA
received an initial distribution of approximately $14,600 from the joint
venture.

     Pasco Financial Services Ltd., Corp., a Hong Kong corporation and
majority-owned subsidiary of Aviation Holdings International
("Pasco-Financial"), specializes in providing financing from banks on behalf of
airlines for aircraft and aviation-related purchases. Pasco-Financial was
recently appointed by China Southwest Airlines to work with banks to provide
financing for three newly-purchased Boeing B737-800 aircraft which are expected
to be delivered in 1999 and 2000. Pasco-Financial has also been appointed by
certain airlines to act as their agent for the sale or lease of aircraft on
behalf of such airlines. Pasco-Financial was also invited by China Southwest
Airlines to arrange the leasing of one of their B757-200 aircraft. To date,
Aviation Holdings International has not recognized any revenue from
Pasco-Financial.

     China Airlines, located in Taipei, Taiwan, has a sophisticated, quality
conscious engine overhaul facility and aircraft maintenance center. Its
maintenance base is located in Taipei, Taiwan. Their $150 million


investment in facilities, equipment, backshops and support mechanisms was
completed in 1997 and is certified by every major aviation regulatory authority
in the world. Two majority owned subsidiaries of Aviation Holdings
International, Aero-Link Flight Systems Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation, and
Aero-Link Flight System, Inc., a Florida corporation (collectively,
"Aero-Link"), act as China Airlines' global marketing representative outside of
Taiwan. To date, we have recognized $122,866 in revenue from Aero-Link.

Credit Facilities

     On August 12, 1998, Aviation Holdings International entered into a Credit
Agreement with Comerica Bank ("Comerica") whereby Comerica agreed to extend a
revolving line of credit to Aviation Holdings International in an amount not to
exceed $3,500,000. The revolving line of credit is intended to fund, if
necessary, working capital needs, such as inventory purchases, and, subject to
Comerica's approval, strategic acquisitions. The funds advanced to Aviation
Holdings International by Comerica are secured by the assets of Aviation
Holdings International and may not at any time exceed the sum of (a) 85% of
Aviation Holdings International's eligible accounts receivable and (b) 35% of
Aviation Holdings International's eligible inventory. As of November 30, 1999,
Aviation Holdings International had an aggregate availability of approximately
$2,440,785 million and an outstanding balance due to Comerica under the
revolving line of credit of approximately $2,125,000 million.

Strategy

     We believe that we can become a low cost leader in the redistribution
market, as well as in the inventory management services industry, by combining
its managerial experience with increased capital and continuing to build upon
its present operations. The essential elements of our business strategy are:

Internal Growth

     We seek to increase our operating revenues and operating income through
continued customer penetration in our existing markets and expansion into new
markets. We intend to achieve such growth by continuing to increase the size
and scope of our inventory and by continuing to expand our marketing efforts
worldwide. We will also expand our inventory management, leasing and
consignment services to allow our customers to reduce their costs of operations
by outsourcing some or all of their inventory management and supply functions
and to take advantage of opportunities to maximize the value of their spare
parts inventory. We will seek to establish and maintain close working
relationships with our customers and to become their vendor of choice.

Capitalize on Large Bulk Purchase Opportunities

     Although opportunities to purchase large inventories in bulk in the
aircraft spare parts industry cannot be predicted, historically they become
available on a regular basis. "Bulk" purchase opportunities arise when:

     o airlines, in order to reduce capital requirements, sell large amounts of
       inventory in a single transaction;

     o inventories of aircraft spare parts are sold in conjunction with asset
       sales or bankruptcy proceedings; or

     o when operators upgrade their fleet.

In these situations, we can obtain large inventories of aircraft spare parts at
a lower cost than can ordinarily be obtained by purchasing on an individual
basis. This results generally in higher gross margins on sales of such parts.
As of September 30, 1999, we had successfully completed approximately eight
bulk inventory purchases in excess of $100,000. We believe that due to our
experience, and as a result of additional capital, we will be able to complete
an increased number of larger bulk purchases.

Purchase and Sale of Jet Turbine Engines and Aircraft

     We believe that with sufficient financial resources, we would be in a
position to increase our activity in the market for the purchase and sale of
jet turbine engines and aircraft. This market is extremely competitive and
capital intensive. We feel, however, that our management has the expertise and
industry contacts to make prudent purchases, which are the key to profitability
in this market.


Pursue Acquisitions of Complementary Businesses

     We will also seek acquisitions of other companies, assets or product lines
that would complement or expand our existing aircraft spare parts
redistribution and inventory management services business. We believe that such
acquisitions will enable us to achieve economies of scale and expand the
product and service lines available to our customers. We are currently
evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities, including several FAA
certified aircraft part repair facilities. No commitments or binding agreements
have been entered into to date and accordingly, no assurance can be given that
any of the acquisitions currently being considered will be consummated.

Diversification

     We are interested in contracting with manufacturers of specialty products
that could diversify our product line. New product distribution agreements
would allow us to exploit our established network of customers, while providing
a value-added service to smaller manufacturers who lack marketing expertise and
distribution capabilities. On a cost basis, such contracts prove to be
lucrative for us, as we are in a position to reap residual commissions without
any of the associated product costs or liability. On January 23, 1997, we
entered into such an agreement with Mirandy Products Ltd., a leading
manufacturer of lavatory systems cleaner for aircraft. We feel that
distribution sales of Mirandy's latest product, "Mirabowl," will serve to
augment our existing line of products and services. Mirabowl is essentially a
lavatory system cleaner and deodorizer that has been designed for flush tank
treatment of all types. Mirandy also manufacturers "Super Vinall," a
multi-purpose aircraft wash which removes carbon and hydraulic fluid buildup
from fuselage areas, degreases aircraft parts and may be used as an interior
cleaner for the cabin area. We intend to begin active marketing of these
products in the near future and have not realized revenues from sales of these
products to date. We are currently negotiating agreements with other
manufacturers whose products relate to aircraft environmental systems and fluid
processing systems.

     We have also been awarded the opportunity to represent six FAA/JAA
approved repair stations throughout specific areas of the world. This
representation applies to component, aircraft and engine repair services
originating from various national and international customers. This opportunity
should allow us to recognize additional income, receive volume discounts on
products and obtain increased recognition in the commercial aviation community,
which will enhance overall brand awareness. We have entered into contracts with
additional maintenance providers and intend to pursue additional relationships.

     We also are seeking to expand our operations in Asia and the Pacific Rim
to include the arrangement of aircraft financing and leasing, aircraft repair
and maintenance coordination, technology consulting and the facilitation of
contracts and cross-border business arrangements between aviation-related
entities from different countries. See "Business -- Asian Operations."

Sales and Marketing; Customers

     We utilize twelve inside and outside salespersons and a network of
independent representatives in our sales and marketing efforts. The respective
Directors of Sales, Marketing and New Business Development provide the synergy
and management which is responsible for obtaining new customers and maintaining
relationships with existing customers. The majority of Aviation Holdings
International's day-to-day sales are accomplished through our inside sales
force.

     We provide sales and delivery services seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
This service is critical to provide support to airline customers which, at any
time, may have an aircraft grounded in need of a particular part. Our South
Florida location, with easy access to Miami International Airport and Fort
Lauderdale International Airport, assists in the reliable and timely delivery
of purchased products. This location also provides access to exceptional import
and export facilities.

     We have over 140 customers, which include aircraft and engine
manufacturers, commercial passenger airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance
and repair facilities, original equipment manufacturers and other aircraft
parts redistribution companies. During the twelve month period ended December
31, 1998, Aviation



Holdings International's top 10 customers accounted for approximately 47% of
net sales, and one customer, Federal Express Corp., accounted for more than 16%
of net sales. During the nine month period ended September 30, 1999, the top 10
customers accounted for approximately 44.7% of net sales, and one customer,
Aviation Sales Company accounted for 8.6% of net sales.

Management Information System

     We have upgraded our management information systems by acquiring computer
hardware and software. Our data system is being developed to incorporate
state-of-the-art records imaging, archiving, inventory and asset management
analysis, financial record and other support systems. We believe that upon full
implementation, our data management system will be adequate to manage our
requirements in accordance with our forecasted growth.

Competition

     The aircraft spare parts redistribution market is highly-fragmented.
Competition is generally based on price, availability of product and quality,
including traceability. Our major competitors include AAR Corp., Aero Controls
Corp., Solair, Inc., The Memphis Group and Aviation Sales Company. There is
also substantial competition, both domestically and overseas, from smaller,
independent dealers who generally participate in niche markets. Several of our
competitors have greater financial and other resources.

     The jet turbine engine and jet turbine aircraft market is currently
dominated by various financial institutions, such as GE Capital, CIT Group, and
International Lease Finance Corp. as well as the major competitors from the
spare parts redistribution market. The market also includes many smaller
entities who engage in transactions on an infrequent basis.

Government Regulation and Traceability

     The FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft,
engines and aircraft and engine parts operated in the United States. Its
regulations are designed to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are
continuously maintained in proper condition for the safe operation of aircraft.
Similar rules apply in other countries. All aircraft must be maintained under a
continuous condition monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough
inspection and maintenance. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures
for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by regulatory
authorities and can be performed only by certified technicians at certified
repair facilities. Certification and conformance is required before
installation of a part on an aircraft. Presently, whenever necessary with
respect to a particular part, we utilize FAA and/or Joint Aviation Authority
("JAA") certified repair stations to repair and certify parts to ensure
worldwide marketability. Our operations may in the future be subject to new and
more stringent regulatory requirements. In that regard, we closely monitor the
FAA and industry trade groups in an attempt to understand how possible future
regulations might impact us. See "Risk Factors -- Stricter Government
Regulations Could Reduce The Value Of Our Inventory And/Or Require Significant
Expenditures."

     An important factor in the aircraft and engine spare parts redistribution
market relates to the documentation or traceability that is supplied with an
aircraft or engine spare part. We require all of our suppliers to provide
adequate documentation as required by the industry and the regulatory agencies.
We are designing out data management system to image, capture, manage and
communicate this documentation.

Employees

     As of November 30, 1999, Aviation Holdings Group employed three persons
and Aviation Holdings International employed 32 persons, including two in Hong
Kong, one in Shenyang and one in Beijing. None of these employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our
employees are good.

Properties

     Our offices and warehouse facilities are located in Miami, Florida. These
facilities comprise a total of approximately 17,600 square feet. The premises
are subject to a lease, under which Aviation Holdings


International is the tenant, dated January 1, 1997 and subsequently amended on
November 1, 1997, which expires on December 31, 2000. Annual rental is $78,348
plus pass-through of (1) utilities, (2) increases in real estate taxes, (3)
assessments, (4) increases in insurance and (5) a pro rata share of assessments
imposed by the industrial park's association. Rent is subject to a cost of
living increase adjustment. We have two additional one year options to renew.
These facilities are adequate for our present and anticipated needs. Pasco-HK
leases office space in Hong Kong at a monthly rental of $2,500 under a two year
lease that expires December 31, 1999. Pasco-HK also leases twenty square meters
of office space in Beijing at an annual rental of $3,600 under a three year
lease that expires November 20, 2001.

Product Liability and Legal Proceedings

     Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death
which may result from a failure of aircraft spare parts sold by it. Management
takes what it believes are adequate precautions to ensure the quality and
traceability of the aircraft parts which it sells. We have a director of
quality control whose responsibilities include implementation of our quality
control system and supervision of our licensed airframe and powerplant
inspectors and operations personnel. Our President, with over 20 years of
experience in the industry, also works with the director of quality control.
Parts that require maintenance are submitted to FAA/JAA certified facilities
for overhaul and recertification as required. We also ensure that all parts
received or shipped are accompanied by proper documentation. The director of
quality control also supervises our document traceability program. We do not
carry product liability insurance. See "Risk Factors -- Our Business May
Subject Us To Expensive Product Liability Claims."

     Neither Aviation Holdings Group nor Aviation Holdings International is
currently involved in any litigation.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
