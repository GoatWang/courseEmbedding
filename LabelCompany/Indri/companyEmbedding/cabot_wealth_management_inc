Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look











Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Wealth Management
4 MINUTE READ









Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.
