Our Practice and Experience
For over three decades, severely injured individuals and families and other attorneys have called on the Brady Law Group for help in their complex civil matters. We have a long track record of multimillion-dollar jury verdicts and settlements against large corporate defendants and big insurance companies.
Our diverse practice covers the entire state of California, including San Francisco and Oakland, and focuses on representing plaintiffs in cases involving:


Catastrophic Injury


Wrongful Death


Spine Injury


Brain Injury


Car Accidents


Personal Injury


Auto Defects


Premises Liability


The Brady Law Group uses the most sophisticated litigation and trial technologies available to deliver persuasive and compelling courtroom presentations. We use state-of-the-art computer and video programs to help explain every aspect of a case in a multimedia format that a jury can understand and identify with. Steven J. Brady is a recognized leader in digital trial presentation and frequently conducts seminars and lectures for other attorneys regarding the effective use of technology in trial. We obtain unparalleled results in complex cases because we know how to connect with a jury and keep them engaged.






Dedicated To Client Satisfaction
The Brady Law Group receives the majority of its cases through referrals by former clients and other attorneys. Every member of our team is dedicated to client satisfaction and the pursuit of justice. We treat our clients with respect, dignity and compassion - the same way we would like to be treated if we needed help. Every question is answered directly and every phone call is returned promptly. We are easily accessible and responsive to our clients and we always keep them informed. Our clients become friends and are treated like members of our extended family. If you hire the Brady Law Group, we will do everything in our power to make sure your case is properly presented and your voice is heard.


The Simple Truth: Who Your Lawyer Is Matters!
Choosing a lawyer is the most important decision you will make in any legal matter. Insurance companies and big business keep statistics on trial lawyers just like teams do on athletes. One of the first things a big insurance company will do when you present a legal claim is look up the background of your attorney. They will review his or her record in litigation and see whether they win at trial. If you have an experienced trial lawyer who consistently wins at trial, the insurance companies will treat you and your case differently.
When you engage the Brady Law Group, it sends a message to the defendants that you are ready to take your case to trial. They will know immediately that you mean business and that your lawyer is one of the best. Call the firm today to set up a free consultation:
