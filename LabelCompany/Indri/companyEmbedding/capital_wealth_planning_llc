Capital Wealth Planning, LLC, Selects Fiserv For Integrated Portfolio Accounting And Trading Solutions






Business Wire




Jun 15, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































  Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), a leading global provider of financial services technology solutions, announced today that Capital Wealth Planning, LLC, a fee-only SEC registered investment advisor (RIA) based in Naples, Florida, has selected Fiserv to support its rapid growth. The firm needed a portfolio accounting and trading platform that could grow with them, and sought easy-to-use technology that would allow them to operate efficiently while serving clients effectively. The firm also wanted a technology partner that could help them stay connected to the wealth management industry and help develop capabilities that would allow the firm to interface to Unified Managed Account (UMA) model delivery platforms.  To meet these objectives, Capital Wealth Planning will utilize Unified Wealth Platform from Fiserv for its portfolio accounting and trading platform, and Wealth Management Network from Fiserv for broader and faster industry connectivity.  "We chose Fiserv to help us achieve greater productivity and efficiency in our investment management process," said Kevin G. Simpson, president and founder of Capital Wealth Planning, LLC. "The scalability, ease of use, and flexibility of the Fiserv platform will help us develop our technology, execute our investment strategies and better serve our clients. In choosing Fiserv, we are confident we made the right decision to grow our business."  The Unified Wealth Platform will allow Capital Wealth Planning to support every part of the investment process with more efficient trading and reconciliation, as well as tools for active portfolio management across multiple managed-account programs and security types, including equities, fixed income, exchange-traded funds and options.  Unified Wealth Platform from Fiserv provides technology automation across the entire wealth management process, including financial planning, retirement-income analysis, portfolio management, trading, accounting, portfolio performance and reporting.  Capital Wealth Planning will also benefit from broader industry connectivity with Wealth Management Network, the premier digital destination for the wealth management industry. Wealth Management Network facilitates real-time connectivity between all major market participants: asset managers, broker-dealers, banks, aggregators and market utilities, as well as advisors, investors and third-party partners, helping to create a digital wealth management ecosystem.

NAPLES, Fla., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Capital Wealth Planning, LLC (CWP) proudly announced its Catholic Values Enhanced Dividend Income (CVEDI) SMA (separately managed account) strategy received a 5-Star Morningstar™ rating. 








The strategy was created for Catholic institutions that require some capital appreciation while generating monthly income for operating expenses. In the world we live in, it can be challenging for the board members who are responsible for making these decisions to identify with investment strategies that provide growth and income while still adhering to social values and religious principles. This strategy was created to bridge that gap.
"Many religious organizations and individual investors need to have access to investment strategies that are in-line with their core values and beliefs. The Catholic Values version of our Enhanced Dividend Income Portfolio does just that," says Kevin Simpson, Capital Wealth Planning's CIO and Founder.
The strategy features a concentrated domestic equity portfolio of 20 to 25 mega-cap blue chips from the S&P 100. CWP investment managers have a built-in filter to screen out S&P 100 companies that do not fall into the realm of socially responsible investing.  The objective of the portfolio is to achieve a consistent 5% to 7% combined yield from dividends and option premiums. Our goal is to earn 2.5% to 3% of annual portfolio income from the dividends and 2% to 5% from the option premiums, which is dependent on levels of volatility and market conditions. 
"The strategy is managed on a risk-adjusted total return basis and we exercise patience when making our investment management decisions." Simpson added, "To earn 2% to 5% of annual income from option premium, CWP implements a tactical covered call overlay.  Unlike many other covered call strategies, CWP is not required to sell calls systematically.  On average, they have about 40% to 70% of the portfolio covered at any given time."
Simpson concluded, "Covered call writing typically works best when we need it to most."

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

How to Break the Ice Around Family Finances

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.
