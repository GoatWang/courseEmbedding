Treatment Outcomes






HomeInsurance CompaniesTreatment Outcomes









InfuSystem® brings 25-plus years of experience to patient care.
We are proud to be known for the clinical expertise we offer to patients and practitioners alike.
Member Satisfaction
Because of the cost-effective nature of infusion therapy, InfuSystem is able to lower patient out-of-pocket costs. This treatment protocol also increases patient mobility and quality of life, and provides the continuity of care that delivers comfort, security and better overall clinical outcomes.
Clinical Care
 Ambulatory pump infusion products and services provided by InfuSystem offer clinically superior outcomes and have been recognized by the American Society of Clinical Oncology as the standard of care for patients requiring this protocol.
InfuSystem is accredited by the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP)
Studies show that patients who are provided with quality care, a nurturing environment and a variety of helpful resources often experience quicker recovery and better overall medical outcomes. InfuSystem provides a professionally trained nursing staff, patient advocates and a wide range of educational tools to help patients and their families better understand the continuous infusion protocol



InfuSystem is dedicated to the professional, cost-effective and compassionate care of ambulatory infusion patients.


InfuSystem provides practices with the ambulatory infusion pumps and supplies they need for their patients at no cost to the practice. Reimbursement is straightforward: the practice bills the patient's insurance for chemotherapy infusion and refilling/maintenance, plus the drugs to be infused, as appropriate. InfuSystem bills the patient's insurance for use of the pump. All supplies for each pump and treatment cycle are billed to the patient's insurance, separately or as a single fee, depending on insurance company preference.
As part of our leading support to health care clinics, InfuSystem provides round-the-clock access to the InfuCare clinical support patient hotline and InfuSupport clinician support hotline for pump-related inquires. We also maintain a vast library of patient education materials that is available to all health care providers.

InfuSystem offers administrative ease to practices and clinics, allowing them to focus on delivering professional, compassionate care to their patients. We provide seamless solutions and managed care options.

					Full Description



InfuSystem Holdings, Inc., incorporated on August 15, 2005, is a provider of infusion pumps and related products and services for patients in the home, oncology clinics, ambulatory surgery centers and other sites of care. The Company delivers local, field-based customer support and also operates pump service and repair Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Texas and Ontario, Canada. The Company's core service is to supply electronic ambulatory infusion pumps and associated disposable supply kits to oncology clinics, infusion clinics and hospital outpatient chemotherapy clinics for the treatment of a range of cancers, including colorectal cancer, pain management and other disease states (Oncology Business). In addition, the Company sells or rents new and pre-owned pole mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to, and provides biomedical recertification, maintenance and repair services for oncology practices, as well as other alternate site settings, including home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing facilities, pain centers and others. The Company also provides these products and services to customers in the hospital market. The Company repairs, refurbishes and provides biomedical certification for the devices as needed. The Company operates through subsidiaries, including InfuSystem Holdings USA, Inc. (Holdings), InfuSystem, Inc. (ISI), First Biomedical, Inc. (First Biomedical) and IFC, LLC (IFC).The Company bills and collects payment from payers and patients for the use of the pumps, after providing ambulatory pumps to oncology offices, infusion clinics and hospital and outpatient chemotherapy clinics. After a physician determines that a patient is eligible for ambulatory infusion pump therapy, the physician arranges for the patient to receive an infusion pump and provides the necessary chemotherapy drugs. The physician and nursing staff train the patient in the use of the pump and initiate service. The physician bills the payers, which include Medicare, Medicaid, third party payer companies or patients for the physician's professional services associated with initiating and supervising the infusion pump administration, as well as the supply of drugs. The Company directly bills payers and patients for copays and deductibles for the use of the pump and related disposable supplies. Billing to payers requires coordination with patients and physicians who initiate the service, as physicians' offices must provide it with paperwork (patient's insurance information, physician's order, an acknowledgement of benefits that shows receipt of equipment by the patient, and, in some cases, physician's progress notes) in order for the Company to bill the payers. The Company provides assistance to those that cannot afford its pumps through a program that matches what the physician practices provide as long as the uninsured patients meet certain criteria.The Company provides patients with around the clock service and support. Physicians use its services to outsource the capital commitment, pump service, maintenance and billing and administrative burdens associated with pump ownership. The Company provides methods for the physician offices to deliver the paperwork for billing through a number of electronic means, including EXPRESS and InfuConnect. Its pumps are available for daily, weekly, monthly or annual rental periods. The Company also provides biomedical maintenance, repair and certification services for the devices it offers, as well as for devices owned by customers. The Company also offers electronic ambulatory infusion pumps for post-operative pain management using its pumps along with a numbing agent and a continuous nerve block catheter, continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB).

	INFUSYSTEM HOLDINGS, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS



	MADISON HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN, March 22, 2017InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MKT: INFU), a leading national provider of infusion pumps and related
	services for the healthcare industry in the United States and Canada, reported financial results today for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016.




	Full Year 2016 Overview:




	 




	 


	


	 


	Held rental revenues of $62.2 million and net collected revenues of $64.9 million nearly flat despite the negative pricing impact of the SE1609 announcement by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
	(CMS);




	 




	 


	


	 


	Increased product sales by 9% to $8.3 million;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Increased third-party payor networks from 340 to 450, or 32%;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Net revenues remained consistent at $70.5 million on increased volume, which offset the pricing impact of SE1609;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Net income decreased from $2.8 million, $0.12 per diluted share, in 2015 to a net loss of ($0.2) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, in 2016.




	 




	 


	


	 


	EBITDA was $11.7 million compared to $13.9 million in the prior year; AEBITDA was $13.0 million compared to $17.2 million in the prior year  decreases largely attributable to the negative pricing impact of the
	SE1609;




	 




	 


	


	 


	EBITDA margin (EBITDA divided by Net Revenues) was 16.6% compared to 19.8% in the same prior year period; AEBITDA (AEBITDA divided by Net Revenues) margin was 18.5% compared to 24.4% in the prior year;










	 


	


	 


	Transitioned more than 1,700 outpatient infusion clinic customers from third party pay model to direct pay model for their Medicare patients, while rolling out the new Express IT computer system; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Increased gross billings by 9%, largest market share held in company history.






	Fourth Quarter Overview:




	 




	 


	


	 


	Net revenues totaled $16.9 million, a decrease of 10% versus fourth quarter 2015 net revenues (pre-SE1609) of $18.7 million;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Product sales decreased 23% to $2.0 million over last years comparable quarter due to a large opportunistic sale in the prior year period;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Bad debt increased 19% for the quarter compared to the prior year period, largely due to the implementation of SE1609;




	 




	 


	

	Management
	Discussion



	Eric K. Steen, chief executive officer of InfuSystem, said, In 2016 we were faced with a number of significant challenges that
	impacted our top- and bottom-lines for the full year. In late April 2016, CMS issued ruling SE1609, announcing that ambulatory infusion pumps would no longer be reimbursed for Medicare patients leaving an outpatient clinic or physician office. Due
	to this material change, we quickly reengineered our entire business process with Medicare patients and we successfully transitioned 1,700 of our outpatient infusion clinic customers to a new fee schedule, our direct pay method for their Medicare
	patients. We accomplished this transition while rolling out our new EXPRESS IT computer system. As a result of our actions, we believe we are strategically positioned to gain market share going forward.


	Fourth quarter financial results and their comparison to prior year reflects the impact of the transition from billing CMS to billing the outpatient
	infusion clinic providers directly. However, due to market share gains, fourth quarter oncology and pain management revenue was up 3% compared to the third quarter on a sequential basis. We can more clearly see the results of our market share gain
	in fourth quarter by the 8% year over year increase in our oncology monthly pump rental volume.


	Our non-opioid post-surgical pain management
	service continues to grow, continued Mr. Steen. At year end, this business was on a run-rate to serve 5,000 patients annually and generate approximately $1 million dollars in net revenue. Several new clients have already implemented in
	2017 and these numbers are moving up and to the right. We will soon be launching our previously developed Block Pain Dashboard Application for mobile phones. We expect this feature to further accelerate the growth of this business in the coming
	years.






	Mr. Steen concluded, We enter 2017 with the largest market share in the history of InfuSystem. We
	recently completed a reengineering and streamlining of our internal operations to increase efficiencies and reduce our annual payroll by more than $1 million. Our plan for 2017 is to focus on leveraging the investments made in the growing the
	infusion market; limit our capital expenditures; and pay down debt to strengthen our balance sheet. Our information technology, suite of electronic connectivity solutions, and infusion pump fleet have us well positioned to compete in 2017 and
	beyond.



	Full Year 2016 Results



	Net Revenue
	for the full year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $70.5 million. Although net revenue was consistent with the prior year, we did experience an increase of 9% in Product Sales offset by a decrease of 1% in rentals, largely due to the
	Companys implementation of SE1609 from CMS, which resulted in our rental revenues being reduced by approximately $2.6 million for the second half of 2016.


	Gross profit decreased $4.9 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year, largely attributable to the increase in cost of revenues  product, service and
	supply costs of $2.4 million, broken down as supplies and material costs of $0.8 million, service costs of $0.8 million, disposable costs of $0.6 million and freight of $0.2 million, while the increase in cost of revenuespump depreciation,
	sales and disposals of $2.4 million was due to $1.5 million of additional pump depreciation as a result of the record number of pump deployments in 2016 and the remaining $0.9 million due to the increased costs of pumps sold during 2016 with lower
	margin. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 63% compared to the prior year at 70%.


	Net Collected Rental Revenue was $56.6 million,
	a decrease of 2%, compared to last years $57.7 million. Bad debt increased $0.4 million compared to the prior year from 8% of Rental Revenue to 9% of Rental Revenue in 2016. This change is largely due to the Companys implementation of
	SE1609 from CMS, which was implemented July 1, 2016. As a result of this change to a portion of our billing procedures, we reserved for potential bad debt, resulting in additional expense of approximately $0.7 million.


	Year-to-date selling and marketing expenses decreased to $9.7 million, or 7%, compared to December 31, 2015 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues
	to 14% compared to the prior year at 15%. The decrease of $0.8 million was largely due to a reduction for salaries and benefits of $0.5 million and travel expenses of $0.2 million.






	General and administrative (G&A) expenses year-to-date were $24.6 million, an increase of 4% from
	$23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in G&A expenses versus the same prior year period was mainly attributable to increases in spending on Information Technology (IT) and pain management initiatives
	of $1.7 million offset by decreases in compensation and employee personnel of $0.9 million. G&A expenses during 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of accounting, administrative, third-party payor billing and contract services, customer service,
	nurses on staff, new product services, and service center personnel salaries, fringe benefits and other payroll related items, professional fees, legal fees, stock-based compensation, insurance and other miscellaneous items.


	Net income for the year decreased from $2.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, to a loss of ($0.2) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, in the current
	year. Adjusted net income for the year, adding back integration costs associated with the Ciscura acquisition, costs associated with our restatement and other income and expenses, was $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to $4.4
	million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the same prior year period. A reconciliation table for Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, to net income can be found in the appendix.


	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.2 million, or 24% to $13.0 million, compared to $17.2 million in the same
	prior year period largely due to costs associated with the implementation of SE1609 and the net impact of our restatement. The Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA as a means to measure its operating performance. A reconciliation table for Adjusted
	EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to EBITDA can be found in the appendix.



	Fourth Quarter Results



	Net Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $16.9 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 10%, compared to the same quarter ended December 31, 2015.
	During the period, net revenue from rentals was $14.8 million, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 8%, compared to the same prior year period. As discussed in previously, the implementation of SE1609 impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2016 by
	a decrease of approximately $1.3 million. Product sales during the quarter totaled $2.0 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 23.0%, compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.


	Selling and marketing expenses were $2.0 million, a decrease of 14%, compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. As a
	percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses declined from 13% to 12% compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was largely due to a reduction in salaries and benefits.






	G&A expenses were $6.3 million, an increase of 3%, compared to $6.1 million for the quarter ended
	December 31, 2015. The increase in G&A expenses versus the same prior year period was mainly attributable to increases in spending on Information Technology (IT) of $0.2 million and outside services of $0.4 million, which
	represents costs as a result of our restatement, offset by decreases in stock compensation of $0.1 million, compensation and employee personnel of $0.2 million and service and repair of $0.1 million. As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses
	increased slightly as a percentage of revenue from 33% to 37% in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely attributable to the decline in revenue on the pricing impact of SE1609.


	Net income in the fourth quarter decreased to a loss of ($0.5) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.07 per
	diluted share, for the fourth quarter of last year.


	For the fourth quarter, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.3 million, or 44% to $2.9 million, compared to
	$5.2 million in the same prior year period. The Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA as a means to measure its operating performance. A reconciliation table for Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, from net income can be found in the appendix of this
	press release.



	Financial Condition



	Net cash
	provided by operations for the full year ended December 31, 2016 was $7.9 million compared to net cash provided by operations of $7.1 million for the prior year period.


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million and $9.9 million of availability on its revolving line-of-credit
	compared to $0.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $9.9 million of availability on its revolving line-of-credit as of December 31, 2015. Total debt less cash on hand (Net Debt) as of December 31, 2016 was $34.1
	million compared to the previous fiscal year of $34.2 million.
