Risk Neglect in Equity Markets
Malcolm Baker
The link between measures of risk and return within the equity market has been very weak over the past 47 years: in the United States, returns on high-risk stocks have cumulatively fallen short of the returns on low-risk stocks, during a period when the equity market as a whole experienced high returns relative to Treasury bills. In the spirit of Fischer Black’s 1993 article “Beta and Return,” published in this journal, the author takes seriously the idea that this evidence reflects a risk anomaly—a mispricing of risk for behavioral and institutional reasons—and revisits the associated implications for investing and corporate finance, examining asset allocation, high leverage in financial firms, low leverage in industrial firms, private equity, venture capital, and bank capital regulation along the way. Many of these implications fit nicely with Black’s original conjectures, and the author highlights refinements and additions to the original list.

Introduction: New Perspectives on Corporate Capital Structure
Viral Acharya, Heitor Almeida and Malcolm Baker
The National Bureau of Economic Research held a symposium titled "New Perspectives on Corporate Capital Structures" on April 5–6, 2013 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In its call for the submission of theoretical and empirical papers for the symposium, the NBER noted that the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 and its aftermath have focused attention on the growing use of leverage by financial intermediaries and on the evolving structure of corporate debt markets—and given rise to new questions about the private and social costs and benefits of leverage and, in particular, the role of leverage in affecting the likelihood and extent of systemic financial distress. On the other hand, rising levels of cash on hand at many non-financial firms have highlighted a "low-leverage puzzle" and raised questions about the implications of cash holdings for corporate investment and economic growth.

Under New Management: Equity Issues and the Attribution of Past Returns
Malcolm Baker and Yuhai Xuan
There is a strong link between measures of stock market performance, such as changes in Tobin's Q or past stock returns, and equity issues. Typically, this performance is thought to be a characteristic of the firm, not the CEO who happens to run the firm. In contrast to this conventional wisdom, we find that equity issues depend on changes in Q and returns to a greater extent if the current CEO was at the helm when those past returns were realized. What we label the CEO-specific Q and past return explains equity issuance, but it does not explain debt issuance, investment, or profitability. Two discontinuity analyses show that the specific share price that the current CEO inherited is an important reference point, while salient share prices prior to turnover are not. A corollary is that a firm with poor stock market performance cannot, or will not, raise new capital unless the current CEO is replaced.

Dividends as Reference Points: A Behavioral Signaling Approach
Malcolm Baker, Brock Mendel and Jeffrey Wurgler
We outline a dividend signaling model that features investors who are averse to dividend cuts. Managers with strong unobservable cash earnings separate by paying high dividends but retain enough to be likely not to fall short next period. The model is consistent with a Lintner partial-adjustment model; modal dividend changes of zero; stronger market reactions to dividend cuts than increases; comparatively infrequent and irregular repurchases; and a mechanism that does not depend on public destruction of value, which managers reject in surveys. New tests involve stronger reactions to changes from longer-maintained dividend levels and reference point currencies of ADR dividends.

Do Strict Capital Requirements Raise the Cost of Capital? Bank Regulation, Capital Structure and the Low Risk Anomaly
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
Traditional capital structure theory predicts that reducing banks' leverage reduces the risk and cost of equity but does not change the weighted average cost of capital, and thus the rates for borrowers. We confirm that the equity of better-capitalized banks has lower beta and idiosyncratic risk. However, over the last 40 years, lower-risk banks have not had lower costs of equity (lower stock returns), consistent with a stock market anomaly previously documented in other samples. A calibration suggests that a binding 10 percentage point increase in Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets could double banks' risk premia over Treasury bills.

The Low-Risk Anomaly: A Decomposition into Micro and Macro Effects
Malcolm Baker, Brendan Bradley and Ryan Taliaferro
Low beta stocks have offered a combination of low risk and high returns. We decompose the anomaly into micro and macro components. The micro component comes from the selection of low beta stocks. The macro component comes from the selection of low beta countries or industries. The two parts both contribute to the low beta anomaly, with important implications for the construction of managed volatility portfolios.

Raising Capital Requirements: At What Cost?
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
Since the financial crisis, bank capital positions have improved considerably. However, calls for heightened capital requirements have not abated. Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, Vice Chair Janet Yellen, and governors Daniel Tarullo and Jeremy Stein have all suggested that Basel III may not go far enough, particularly for large and complex banks. The legislation proposed by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown and David Vitter lays out a plan to raise requirements further, and there are other recommendations both by policymakers and academics. This article examines an unrecognized cost of capital requirements that needs to be added to the regulatory conversations in Basel, Brussels, London, and Washington.

Comovement and Predictability Relationships Between Bonds and the Cross-Section of Stocks
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
Government bonds comove more strongly with bond-like stocks: stocks of large, mature, low-volatility, profitable, dividend-paying firms that are neither high growth nor distressed. Variables derived from the yield curve that are already known to predict returns on bonds also predict returns on bond-like stocks; investor sentiment, a predictor of the cross section of stock returns, also predicts excess bond returns. These relationships remain in place even when bonds and stocks become "decoupled" at the index level. They are driven by a combination of effects including correlations between real cash flows on bonds and bond-like stocks, correlations between their risk-based return premia, and periodic flights to quality.

The Effect of Reference Point Prices on Mergers and Acquisitions
Malcolm Baker, Xin Pan and Jeffrey Wurgler
Prior stock price peaks of targets affect several aspects of merger and acquisition activity. Offer prices are biased toward recent peak prices although they are economically unremarkable. An offer's probability of acceptance jumps discontinuously when it exceeds a peak price. Conversely, bidder shareholders react more negatively as the offer price is influenced upward toward a peak. Merger waves occur when high returns on the market and likely targets make it easier for bidders to offer a peak price. Parties thus appear to use recent peaks as reference points or anchors to simplify the complex tasks of valuation and negotiation.

Global, Local, and Contagious Investor Sentiment
Malcolm Baker, Jeffrey Wurgler and Yu Yuan
We construct investor sentiment indices for six major stock markets and decompose them into one global and six local indices. In a validation test, we find that relative sentiment is correlated with the relative prices of dual-listed companies. Global sentiment is a contrarian predictor of country-level returns. Both global and local sentiment are contrarian predictors of the time-series of cross-sectional returns within markets: When sentiment is high, future returns are low on relatively difficult to arbitrage and difficult to value stocks. Private capital flows appear to be one mechanism by which sentiment spreads across markets and forms global sentiment.

Benchmarks as Limits to Arbitrage: Understanding the Low-Volatility Anomaly
Malcolm Baker, Brendan Bradley and Jeffrey Wurgler
Contrary to basic finance principles, high-beta and high-volatility stocks have long underperformed low-beta and low-volatility stocks. This anomaly may be partly explained by the fact that the typical institutional investor's mandate to beat a fixed benchmark discourages arbitrage activity in both high-alpha, low-beta stocks and low-alpha, high-beta stocks.

Can Mutual Fund Managers Pick Stocks? Evidence from Their Trades Prior to Earnings Announcements
Malcolm Baker, Lubomir Litov, Jessica Wachter and Jeffrey Wurgler
We consider measures of stock-picking skill of mutual fund managers based on the earnings announcement returns of the stocks that they hold and trade. Relative to standard approaches, this approach focuses on an especially informative subset of the returns data, potentially increasing power to detect skilled trading, and also sheds light on the sources of skilled trading. We find that the average fund's recent buys significantly outperform its recent sells around subsequent earnings announcements. We find that mutual fund trades also forecast EPS surprises. The point estimates suggest that skilled trading around earnings announcements, deriving from an ability to forecast economic fundamentals, represents a disproportionate fraction of the total abnormal returns to skilled trading by mutual funds estimated in prior work.

Catering Through Nominal Share Prices
Malcolm Baker, Robin Greenwood and Jeffrey Wurgler
We propose and test a catering theory of nominal stock prices. The theory predicts that when investors place higher valuation on low-price firms, managers will maintain share prices at lower levels, and vice-versa. Using measures of time-varying catering incentives based on valuation ratios, split announcement effects, and future returns, we find empirical support for the predictions in both time-series and firm-level data. Given the strong cross-sectional relationship between capitalization and nominal share price, an interpretation of the results is that managers may be trying to categorize their firms as small firms when investors favor small firms.

Capital Market-Driven Corporate Finance
Malcolm Baker
Much of empirical corporate finance focuses on sources of the demand for various forms of capital, not the supply. Recently, this has changed. Supply effects of equity and credit markets can arise from a combination of three ingredients: investor tastes, limited intermediation, and corporate opportunism. Investor tastes, when combined with imperfectly competitive intermediaries, lead prices and interest rates to deviate from fundamental values. Opportunistic firms respond by issuing securities with high prices and investing the proceeds. A link between capital market prices and corporate finance can, in principle, come from either supply or demand. This framework helps to organize empirical approaches that more precisely identify and quantify supply effects through variation in one of these three ingredients. Taken as a whole, the evidence shows that shifting equity and credit market conditions play an important role in dictating corporate finance and investment.

Multinationals as Arbitrageurs? The Effect of Stock Market Valuations on Foreign Direct Investment
Malcolm Baker, C. Fritz Foley and Jeffrey Wurgler
Empirical evidence of imperfect integration across world capital markets suggests a role for cross-border arbitrage by multinationals. Consistent with  multinational arbitrage as a determinant of foreign direct investment (FDI) patterns, we find that FDI flows increase sharply with source-country stock market valuations—particularly the component of valuations that is predicted to revert the next year, and particularly in the presence of capital account restrictions that limit other mechanisms of cross-country arbitrage. The results suggest the existence of a cheap financial capital channel in which FDI flows reflect, in part, the use of relatively low-cost capital available to overvalued parents in the source country.

How Does Investor Sentiment Affect the Cross-Section of Returns
Malcolm Baker, Johnathan Wang and Jeffrey Wurgler
    Broad waves of investor sentiment  should have larger impacts on securities that are more difficult to  value and to arbitrage. Consistent with this intuition, we find that  when an index of investor sentiment takes low values, small, young, high volatility, unprofitable, non-dividend-paying, extreme growth, and distressed stocks earn relatively higher subsequent returns. When sentiment is high, the aforementioned categories of stocks earn relatively lower subsequent returns.

Corporate Financing Decisions When Investors Take the Path of Least Resistance
Malcolm Baker, Joshua Coval and Jeremy Stein
    We explore the consequences for  corporate financial policy that arise when investors exhibit inertial  behavior. One implication of investor inertia is that, all else equal, a  firm pursuing a strategy of equity-financed growth will prefer a  stock-for-stock merger to greenfield investment financed with an SEO.  With a merger, acquirer stock is placed in the hands of investors, who,  because of inertia, do not resell it all on the open market. If there is  downward-sloping demand for acquirer shares, this leads to less price  pressure than an SEO, and cheaper equity financing as a result. We  develop a simple model to illustrate this idea, and present supporting  empirical evidence. Both individual and institutional investors tend to  hang on to shares granted them in mergers, with this tendency being much  stronger for individuals. Consistent with the model and with this  cross-sectional pattern in inertia, acquirers targeting firms with high  institutional ownership experience more negative announcement effects  and greater announcement volume. Moreover, the results are strongest  when the overlap in target and acquirer institutional ownership is low  and when the demand curve for the acquirer's shares appears to be steep.

Investor Sentiment in the Stock Market
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
We examine how investor sentiment affects  the cross-section of stock returns. Theory predicts that a broad wave of  sentiment will disproportionately affect stocks whose valuations are  highly subjective and are difficult to arbitrage. We test this  prediction by studying how the cross-section of subsequent stock returns  varies with proxies for beginning-of-period investor sentiment. When  sentiment is low, subsequent returns are relatively high on smaller  stocks, high volatility stocks, unprofitable stocks, non-dividend-paying  stocks, extreme-growth stocks, and distressed stocks, consistent with  an initial underpricing of these stocks. When sentiment is high, on the  other hand, these patterns attenuate or fully reverse. The results are  consistent with predictions and appear unlikely to reflect an  alternative explanation based on compensation for systematic risk.

The Effect of Dividends on Consumption
Malcolm Baker, Stefan Nagel and Jeffrey Wurgler
Classical models predict that the division of stock returns into dividends and  capital appreciation does not affect investor consumption patterns, while mental accounting and other economic frictions predict that  investors have a higher propensity to consume from stock returns in the form of dividends. Using two micro data sets, we show that investors are indeed far more likely to consume from dividends than capital gains. In the Consumer Expenditure Survey, household consumption increases with dividend income, controlling for total wealth, total portfolio returns, and other sources of income. In a sample of household investment accounts data from a brokerage, net withdrawals from the accounts increase one-for-one with ordinary dividends of moderate size, controlling for total portfolio returns, and also increase with mutual fund and special dividends. We comment on several potential explanations for the results.

Predicting Returns with Managerial Decision Variables: Is There a Small-Sample Bias?
Malcolm Baker, Ryan Taliaferro and Jeffrey Wurgler
Many studies find that aggregate managerial decision variables, such as aggregate equity issuance, predict stock or bond market returns. Recent research argues that these findings may be driven by an aggregate time-series version of Schultz's (2003, Journal of Finance 58, 483-517) pseudo market-timing bias. Using standard simulation techniques, we find that the bias is much too small to account for the observed predictive power of the equity share in new issues, corporate  investment plans, insider trading, dividend initiations, or the maturity of corporate debt issues.

Appearing and Disappearing Dividends: The Link to Catering Incentives
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
We document a close link between  fluctuations in the propensity to pay dividends and catering incentives.  First, we use the methodology of Fama and French (J. Finan. Econ.  (2001)) to identify a total of four distinct trends in the propensity to  pay dividends between 1963 and 2000. Second, we show that each of these  trends lines up with a corresponding fluctuation in catering  incentives: The propensity to pay increases when a proxy for the stock  market dividend premium is positive and decreases when it is negative.  The lone disconnect is attributable to Nixon-era controls.

A Catering Theory of Dividends
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
    We  propose that the decision to pay dividends is driven by prevailing  investor demand for dividend payers. Managers cater to investors by  paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and  by not paying when investors prefer nonpayers. To test this prediction,  we construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand for  dividend payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends  when demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends  when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are  better explained by catering than other theories of dividends.

Market Liquidity as a Sentiment Indicator
Malcolm Baker and Jeremy Stein
    We build a model that helps to explain why  increases in liquidity-such as lower bid-ask spreads, a lower price  impact of trade, or higher turnover-predict lower subsequent returns in  both firm-level and aggregate data. The model features a class of  irrational investors, who underreact to the information contained in  order flow, thereby boosting liquidity. In the presence of short-sales  constraints, high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is  dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This  theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market  for seasoned equity offerings, by simply following a rule of thumb that  involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid.  Empirically, we find that: (i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and  share turnover are highly correlated; yet (ii) in a multiple  regression, both have incremental predictive power for future  equal-weighted market returns.

The Maturity of Debt Issues and Predictable Variation in Bond Returns
Malcolm Baker, Robin Greenwood and Jeffrey Wurgler
The maturity of new debt issues predicts excess bond returns. When the  share of long-term debt issues in total debt issues is high, future  excess bond returns are low. This predictive power comes in two parts. First, inflation, the real short-term rate, and the term spread predict excess bond returns. Second, these same variables explain the long-term share, and together account for much of its own ability to predict excess bond returns. The results are consistent with survey evidence that firms use debt market conditions in an effort to determine the lowest-cost maturity at which to borrow.

The Determinants of Board Structure at the Initial Public Offering
Malcolm Baker and Paul Gompers
    This paper describes board size and  composition and investigates the role of venture capital in a sample of  1,116 firms' initial public offerings. First, firms backed by venture  capital have fewer insider and instrumental directors and more  independent outsiders. Second, we consider board composition as the  outcome of a bargain between the CEO and outside shareholders.  Representation of independent outsiders on the board decreases with the  power of the CEO--tenure and voting control--and increases with the  power of outside investors--venture capital backing and venture firm  reputation. Third, within the sample of firms financed by venture  capital and also consistent with a bargaining model, the probability  that a founder remains as CEO is decreasing in venture firm reputation.  Finally, we examine the influence of venture capital backing and board  structure on firm outcomes in the 10 years after the initial public  offering.

When Does the Market Matter? Stock Prices and the Investment of Equity-Dependent Firms
Malcolm Baker, Jeremy Stein and Jeffrey Wurgler
    We use a simple model of corporate  investment to determine when investment will be sensitive to  non-fundamental movements in stock prices. The key cross-sectional  prediction of the model is that stock prices will have a stronger impact  on the investment of firms that are 'equity dependent' - firms that  need external equity to finance their marginal investments. Using an  index of equity dependence based on the work of Kaplan and Zingales  (1997), we find strong support for this prediction. In particular, firms  that rank in the top quintile of the KZ index have investment that is  almost three times as sensitive to stock prices as firms in the bottom  quintile. We also verify several other predictions of the model.

Limited Arbitrage in Mergers and Acquisitions
Malcolm Baker and Serkan Savasoglu
    A diversified portfolio of risk arbitrage  positions produces an abnormal return of 0.6-0.9% per month over the  period from 1981 to 1996. We trace these profits to practical limits on  risk arbitrage. In our model of risk arbitrage, arbitrageurs'  risk-bearing capacity is constrained by deal completion risk and the  size of the position they hold. Consistent with this model, we document  that the returns to risk arbitrage increase in an ex ante measure of  completion risk and target size. We also examine the influence of the  general supply of arbitrage capital, measured by the total equity  holdings of arbitrageurs, on arbitrage profits.

Market Timing and Capital Structure
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
    It is well known that firms tend to raise  equity when their market values are high relative to book and past  market values. We document that the resulting effects on capital  structure are very persistent. As a consequence, current capital  structure is strongly related to past market valuations. The results are  difficult to explain within traditional theories of capital structure  and suggest that capital structure is the cumulative outcome of past  attempts to time the equity market.

The Equity Share in New Issues and Aggregate Stock Returns
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
    The share of equity issues in total new  equity and debt issues is a strong predictor of U.S. stock market  returns between 1928 and 1997. In particular, firms issue relatively  more equity than debt just before periods of low market returns. The  equity share in new issues has stable predictive power in both halves of  the sample period and after controlling for other known predictors. We  do not find support for efficient market explanations of the results.  Instead, the fact that the equity share sometimes predicts significantly  negative market returns suggests inefficiency and that firms time the  market component of their returns when issuing securities.

Alternative Models of Uncertain Commodity Prices for Use with Modern Asset Pricing Methods
Malcolm Baker, E. S. Mayfield and John Parsons
This paper provides an introduction to alternative models of uncertain commodity prices. A model of commodity price movements is the engine around which any valuation methodology for commodity production projects is built, whether discounted cash flow (DCF) models or the recently developed  modern asset pricing (MAP) methods. The accuracy of the valuation is in part dependent on the quality of the engine employed. This paper provides an overview of several basic commodity price models and explains the essential differences among them. We also show how futures prices can be used to discriminate among the models and to estimate better key parameters of the model chosen.

Behavioral Corporate Finance: A Current Survey
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
We survey the theory and evidence of behavioral corporate finance, which generally takes one of two approaches. The market timing and catering approach views managerial financing and investment decisions as rational managerial responses to securities mispricing. The managerial biases approach studies the direct effects of managers' biases and nonstandard preferences on their decisions. We review relevant psychology, economic theory and predictions, empirical challenges, empirical evidence, new directions such as behavioral signaling, and open questions.

Behavioral Corporate Finance: A Survey
Malcolm Baker, Richard Ruback and Jeffrey Wurgler
Research in behavioral corporate finance takes two distinct approaches. The first emphasizes that investors are less than fully rational. It views managerial financing and investment decisions as rational responses to securities market mispricing. The second approach emphasizes that managers are less than fully rational. It studies the effect of nonstandard preferences and judgmental biases on managerial decisions. This survey reviews the theory, empirical challenges, and current evidence pertaining to each approach. Overall, the behavioral approaches help to explain a number of important financing and investment patterns. The survey closes with a list of open questions.

The Risk Anomaly Tradeoff of Leverage
Malcolm Baker, Mathias F. Hoeyer and Jeffrey Wurgler
Higher-beta and higher-volatility equities do not earn commensurately higher returns, a pattern known as the risk anomaly. In this paper, we consider the possibility that the risk anomaly represents mispricing and develop its implications for corporate leverage. The risk anomaly generates a simple tradeoff theory: at zero leverage, the overall cost of capital falls as leverage increases equity risk, but as debt becomes riskier, the marginal benefit of increasing equity risk declines. We show that there is an interior optimum and that it is reached at lower leverage for firms with high asset risk. Empirically, the risk anomaly tradeoff theory and the traditional tradeoff theory are both consistent with the finding that firms with low-risk assets choose higher leverage. More uniquely, the risk anomaly theory helps to explain why leverage is inversely related to systematic risk, holding constant total risk; why leverage is inversely related to upside risk, not just downside risk; why numerous firms maintain low or zero leverage despite high marginal tax rates; and, why other firms maintain high leverage despite little tax benefit.

Do Strict Capital Requirements Raise the Cost of Capital? Banking Regulation and the Low Risk Anomaly 
Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler
Minimum capital requirements are a central tool of banking regulation. Setting them balances a number of factors, including any effects on the cost of capital and in turn the rates available to borrowers. Standard theory predicts that, in perfect and efficient capital markets, reducing banks' leverage reduces the risk and cost of equity but leaves the overall weighted average cost of capital unchanged. We test these two predictions using U.S. data. We confirm that the equity of better-capitalized banks has lower systematic risk (beta) and lower idiosyncratic risk. However, over the last 40 years, lower risk banks have higher stock returns on a risk-adjusted or even a raw basis, consistent with a stock market anomaly previously documented in other samples. The size of the low risk anomaly within banks suggests that the cost of capital effects of capital requirements may be considerable. Assuming competitive lending markets, banks' low asset betas implied an average risk premium of only 40 basis points above Treasury yields in our sample period; a calibration suggests that a ten percentage-point increase in Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets may have increased this to between 100 and 130 basis points per year. In summary, the low risk anomaly in the stock market produces a potentially significant cost of capital requirements.

Corning, 2002
Malcolm Baker
Corning, with large investments in fiber optic technology, was hit particularly hard by the collapse of the telecommunications industry in 2001. With over $4 billion in debt, the firm's survival appears to rest on raising additional equity capital. James Flaws, the chief financial officer, is considering raising $500 million with an issue of mandatory convertible preferred stock. The protagonist is considering whether to invest in Corning or in a new mandatory convertible preferred stock that is being offered to the public.

Longbow Capital Partners
Malcolm Baker, Samuel G. Hanson and James Weber
Longbow Capital Partners is a value-oriented long/short hedge fund focused on stocks in the energy sector. In January 2011, Longbow had invested in NiSource, a Fortune 500 company that owns a diverse portfolio of regulated energy businesses. In late 2014, Longbow was deciding whether or not to maintain its position in NiSource. To make this decision, students must perform a discounted dividend analysis to determine the fundamental value of NiSource's stock. Students are also asked to perform a sum-of-the-parts analysis to assess the implications of NiSource's recent proposal to pursue a tax-advantaged spin-off of its pipeline business.

Restructuring JAL
Malcolm Baker, Adi Sunderam, Nobuo Sato and Akiko Kanno
Hideo Seto, the recently appointed chairman of the investment committee of the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, must decide whether to push JAL group, Japan's largest airline, into bankruptcy or to act as a sponsor in an out-of-court restructuring. The bankruptcy of JAL would be the largest ever for an industrial firm in Japan's history. The case introduces the mechanics of bankruptcy, the tradeoff between out-of-court restructuring and bankruptcy, and the costs of financial distress. At the level of public policy, the case also serves as a useful backdrop to discuss the role of bankruptcy in the efficient functioning of the economy, and the related comparison between Japan and the U.S. in terms of both the bankruptcy code and the cultural attitudes toward corporate restructuring. This case can fit into an introductory course in a module on capital structure and the tradeoff between the costs and benefits of debt or in an advanced corporate restructuring course in a module on the effect of different legal and cultural environments on bankruptcy proceedings.

Dividend Policy at Linear Technology
Malcolm P. Baker and Alison Berkley Wagonfeld
In 1992, Linear Technology, a designer and manufacturer of analog semiconductors, initiated a dividend. The firm increased its dividend by approximately $0.01 per share each year thereafter. In fiscal year 2002, Linear experienced its first significant drop in sales since its 1986 initial public offering. Sales dropped by 47%, and profits fell by 54%. In the spring of 2003, CFO Paul Coghlan is deciding whether to recommend yet another increase in dividends to lift Linear's payout ratio to 33.1%, high by the standards of technology firms.

Pharmacyclics: Financing Research & Development
Malcolm P. Baker, Richard S. Ruback and Aldo Sesia
Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC), a pharmaceutical company that manufactures products that will improve existing therapeutic treatments for cancer, arteriosclerosis, and retinal disease, was considering a $60 million private placement in February 2000. The company had more cash than ever before, but projections of R&D and marketing expenses were also unprecedented. PCYC's most promising oncology drug, a radiation enhancer called Xcytrin, was in Phase III clinical trials--the rigorous final phase before FDA approval for commercialization. Analysts gave the drug a slightly better than 50% chance of success. This case focuses on stage financing and a simple decision-tree evaluation. Students have the opportunity to consider the impact of past staged financing decisions on the ownership structure of the firm and to evaluate the current stock market price in light of analyst forecasts of the cash flow and the probability of success for each drug. These two analyses help inform the private placement decision.

Career Concerns and Staged Investment: Evidence from the Venture Capital Industry
Malcolm Baker
I develop a model in which career concerns lead to inefficient reinvestment decisions. Managers have incentives to inflate interim returns by continuing bad projects and delaying write-offs. In  the venture capital industry, the syndication of follow-on investments  can help to solve this problem by providing an intermediate, arm's-length valuation. The evidence suggests that young venture firms do use syndication to certify investment quality. Moreover, the gap in quality between syndicated and non-syndicated investments -- measured by ex post outcomes -- is especially high for young venture  firms, consistent with the hypothesis that career concerns reduce the  efficiency of staged investment.

Executive Ownership and Control in Newly Public Firms: The Role of Venture Capitalists
Malcolm Baker and Paul Gompers
    We study the implications of CEO equity ownership for incentives and control in a sample of 1,011 newly public firms. Before an initial public offering, equity investments by venture capitalists reduce CEO ownership by about half, from an average of 35 percent to 19 percent. Venture capitalists narrow this difference by granting options, reducing secondary sales, and lowering the dilution by primary shares, but a gap in post-IPO CEO equity ownership remains. The effect of this lower ownership on incentives depends upon the measure employed - the dollar sensitivity of CEO pay to firm value is lower in venture firms, but the elasticity is about the same. In addition, we present evidence that lower ownership, combined with concentrated outside holdings, leads to a reduction in the agency costs of managerial control. We conclude that the patterns of ownership in part represent a tradeoff by venture capitalists between the benefits of incentives and the agency costs of control.

Estimating Industry Multiples
Malcolm Baker and R. S. Ruback
We analyze industry multiples for the S&P 500 in 1995. We use Gibbs sampling to estimate simultaneously the error specification and small sample minimum variance multiples for 22 industries. In addition, we consider the performance of four common multiples: the simple mean, the harmonic mean, the value-weighted mean, and the median. The harmonic mean is a close approximation to the Gibbs minimum variance estimates. Finally, we show that EBITDA is a better single basis of substitutability than  EBIT or revenue in the industries that we examine.
Keywords: Management Analysis, Tools, and Techniques; 
				  Performance; 
				  Mathematical Methods;

Risk Neglect in Equity Markets

Abstract
The link between measures of risk and return within the equity market has been very weak over the past 47 years: in the United States, returns on high-risk stocks have cumulatively fallen short of the returns on low-risk stocks, during a period when the equity market as a whole experienced high returns relative to Treasury bills. In the spirit of Fischer Black’s 1993 article “Beta and Return,” published in this journal, the author takes seriously the idea that this evidence reflects a risk anomaly—a mispricing of risk for behavioral and institutional reasons—and revisits the associated implications for investing and corporate finance, examining asset allocation, high leverage in financial firms, low leverage in industrial firms, private equity, venture capital, and bank capital regulation along the way. Many of these implications fit nicely with Black’s original conjectures, and the author highlights refinements and additions to the original list.

Dogs of the Dow
Malcolm Baker, Samuel G. Hanson and James Weber
This case describes the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy, value investing, and using dividend yields as a means to determine intrinsic value. It also describes exchange traded notes and a particular exchange traded note, known as the Dogs of the Dow, which tracks the performance of the 10 highest yielding stocks of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The case provides share price data, dividend data, and financial statement data on the 30 DJIA companies to enable students to perform their own calculations.

Corning, 2002
Malcolm Baker
Corning, with large investments in fiber optic technology, was hit particularly hard by the collapse of the telecommunications industry in 2001. With over $4 billion in debt, the firm's survival appears to rest on raising additional equity capital. James Flaws, the chief financial officer, is considering raising $500 million with an issue of mandatory convertible preferred stock. The protagonist is considering whether to invest in Corning or in a new mandatory convertible preferred stock that is being offered to the public.

Under New Management: Equity Issues and the Attribution of Past Returns
Malcolm Baker and Yuhai Xuan
There is a strong link between measures of stock market performance, such as changes in Tobin's Q or past stock returns, and equity issues. Typically, this performance is thought to be a characteristic of the firm, not the CEO who happens to run the firm. In contrast to this conventional wisdom, we find that equity issues depend on changes in Q and returns to a greater extent if the current CEO was at the helm when those past returns were realized. What we label the CEO-specific Q and past return explains equity issuance, but it does not explain debt issuance, investment, or profitability. Two discontinuity analyses show that the specific share price that the current CEO inherited is an important reference point, while salient share prices prior to turnover are not. A corollary is that a firm with poor stock market performance cannot, or will not, raise new capital unless the current CEO is replaced.

				  Equity;
