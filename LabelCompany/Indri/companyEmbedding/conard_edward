About The Upside of Inequality
The scourge of America’s economy isn’t the success of the 1 percent—quite the opposite. The real problem is the government’s well-meaning but misguided attempt to reduce the payoffs for success.  Four years ago, Edward Conard wrote a controversial bestseller, Unintended Consequences, which set the record straight on the financial crisis of 2008 and explained why U.S. growth was accelerating relative to other high-wage economies. He warned that loose monetary policy would produce neither growth nor inflation, that expansionary fiscal policy would have no lasting benefit on growth in the aftermath of the crisis, and that ill-advised attempts to rein in banking based on misplaced blame would slow an already weak recovery. Unfortunately, he was right.  Now he’s back with another provocative argument: that our current obsession with income inequality is misguided and will only slow growth further.  Using fact-based logic, Conard tracks the implications of an economy now constrained by both its capacity for risk-taking and by a shortage of properly trained talent—rather than by labor or capital, as was the case historically. He uses this fresh perspective to challenge the conclusions of liberal economists like Larry Summers and Joseph Stiglitz and the myths of “crony capitalism” more broadly.  Instead, he argues that the growing wealth of most successful Americans is not to blame for the stagnating incomes of the middle and working classes. If anything, the success of the 1 percent has put upward pressure on employment and wages. Conard argues that high payoffs for success motivate talent to get the training and take the risks that gradually loosen the constraints to growth. Well-meaning attempts to decrease inequality through redistribution dull these incentives, gradually hurting not just the 1 percent but everyone else as well.  Conard outlines a plan for growing middle- and working-class wages in an economy with a near infinite supply of labor that is shifting from capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-intensive, innovation-driven fields. He urges us to stop blaming the success of the 1 percent for slow wage growth and embrace the upside of inequality: faster growth and greater prosperity for everyone.

About The Upside of Inequality
From the New York Times-bestselling author of Unintended Consequences comes another bold and contrarian book by the man who famously defended capitalism and the one percent at the height of the Occupy movement. Conventional wisdom says income inequality is rising and harmful to nearly everyone, and the rich are to blame. But as Ed Conard shows, anyone who can produce a product valued by the entire economy will find his or her income growing faster than those who are limited by the number of customers they can serve, such as schoolteachers, plumbers, doctors, and lawyers. Consider Taylor Swift, the current queen of pop, who made $64 million in 2014. She earns more because her audience is huge, not because she takes anything away from the tens of millions of fans who happily pay for all those concert tickets, iTunes downloads, and souvenir t-shirts. Her ability to generate value can scale with the economy. The same is true for others who improve the lives of millions, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook. The growing success of innovators doesn’t hurt the rest of the workforce. In fact, the opposite is true–their success increases the demand for our middle and working class labor. Challenging the arguments of liberal economists like Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, Conard reveals the truth about the income inequality panic. And by drawing on a historical study of the ebbs and flows of our economy, he proposes ways to grow the economy faster, which will benefit everyone on the income spectrum.

Praise

    “Ed Conard challenges misconceptions that distort our economic debates. He debunks the myth that inequality is a conspiracy perpetuated by robber barons and sheds light on the complex economic phenomena that shape America’s success. Readers of all political persuasions will benefit from this highly-informative book.” —Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute “This provocative new book by Ed Conard is a must-read for serious students of economic policy. Conard’s core thesis—that advancement in living standards is constrained by risk capital and properly trained talent—suggests an inequality borne of returns from innovation. His solutions are sensible and all the more compelling in the context of this paean to risk-taking.” —Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers   “Conard makes a fresh argument for the productive value of inequality, which is that scarce entrepreneurial effort and risk-tolerant capital are the resources that are both most central to economic growth and most sensitive to the potential distortions imposed by taxation and regulation. Whether or not one accepts this argument, it’s an argument well worth having.” —David Autor, professor of economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology   “I profoundly disagree with much of what is in Conard’s book but respect the clarity with which he makes his case.  Agree or disagree, this book can sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues, making it a very valuable contribution.” —Larry Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury and Director of the National Economic Council, President Emeritus, Harvard University   “Ed Conard puts forward a comprehensive explanation of the modern economy. Critics may dismiss it as a defense of the 1 percent, but it’s much, much more than that. I rarely see economic analysis as insightful as this.” —Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management   “Page after page, Ed Conard challenges conventional wisdom about the causes of growing inequality, the constraints to growth, and the feasibility of commonly proposed solutions to advance a thought-provoking blueprint for growing middle- and working-class incomes in a world with an abundance of workers. Whether you agree or not, this is serious thinking for serious thinkers.” —Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts

Early life and education[edit]
Conard graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S.E. in Operations Research in 1978.[1] He earned his M.B.A. with distinction from Harvard Business School in 1982.[1]
Early career and Bain Capital[edit]
Prior to business school, Conard worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company. After graduating, he joined Bain & Company, the Boston-based global management-consulting firm, eventually becoming a vice president and leading the firm’s industrial practice.[2]
Conard left Bain in 1990 to become a director at Wasserstein Perella & Co., a boutique investment bank. At Wassernstein, he headed the firm's Transaction Development Group.[2]
Conard was a managing director at Bain Capital, the head of Bain's New York office and the leader of its industrial practice.[3] He joined the firm in 1993 prior to the firm raising $300 million of private equity.[4] When Conard retired in 2007, Bain Capital managed $75 billion of capital and had offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Mumbai.[4] His first acquisition was that of a pharmaceutical company for half a billion dollars. That same company later rose to more than $10 billion in value.[5]
While at Bain Capital, Conard took Waters Corporation, DDI, ChipPac, Innophos, and Sensata public and sat on their boards of directors.[6][7][8][9] He still sits on the board of Waters Corporation.[10]
Writing, speaking, and scholar career[edit]
Conard is the author two top-ten New York Times bestsellers: Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong and The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class. He became the tenth most searched author on Google in 2012 after publishing his first book.[11] Conard joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting fellow in 2012.[12] His work with AEI focuses on U.S. economic policy - in particular, on the effect of taxes, government policies, and finance on risk-taking and innovation.[1]
Unintended Consequences[edit]
Conard published Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong in May 2012.[13] The book was featured on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine and went on to become a New York Times top ten non-fiction bestseller.[14]
While the New York Times predicted the book might become “the most hated book of the year,”[2] leading economists such as Greg Mankiw, Andrei Shleifer, Steven Levitt, Nouriel Roubini, Tyler Cowen, and Glenn Hubbard publicly endorsed the book.[15] In contrast to the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal called the book “a full throttle defense of economic dynamism…refreshing at a time when so many take the failure of capitalism for granted.”[16] The New York Times described Unintended Consequences as “…arguing that growing income inequality shows the economy is working.” Timothy Noah, the author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality noted: “the biggest surprise, on opening Unintended Consequences, lies in discovering that this book isn't about income inequality at all.”[17] The book analyzes why the U.S. has outperformed other high-wage economies, explains the causes the financial crisis, and makes recommendations for accelerating growth in its aftermath.[13] Conard summarizes his book in a 23-minute video for The UP Experience.[18]
Since its publication, Conard has made numerous television appearances in which he has debated leading economists including Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, and Jared Bernstein; journalists including Fareed Zakaria, Chris Hayes, and Andrew Ross Sorkin; and politicians such as Barney Frank, Howard Dean, and Eliot Spitzer.[19] Conard also debated Jon Stewart for 33 minutes, one of Stewart’s longest interviews.[20] The video of the debate has received nearly 100,000 views. He has also written op-eds for The Wall Street Journal,[21] The Washington Post,[22] Foreign Affairs,[23] Harvard Business Review,[24] Fortune,[25] and Politico,[26] among others.
The Upside of Inequality[edit]
Conard published The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class in September 2016.[27] The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non-fiction list and reached #1 on the New York Times business book list.[28][29]
The Upside of Inequality was met with positive reviews, including former president of Harvard University and economist Larry Summers, a very tough critic on the other side of the aisle, blurbed: I disagree but respect the argument, calling it "a very valuable contribution" that will "sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues."[30] Noted economist Tyler Cowen who wrote on Bloomberg News: "Conard’s central idea is that risk-bearing equity capital is the truly scarce asset in most economic situations, and economic analysis should adapt accordingly. He is very creative in seeing some of the implications of this view. I. . .found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way."[31] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it.[32] National Review said the book is a "rousing defense of conservative beliefs about how markets and incentives drive prosperity."[33]
Political activities[edit]
Conard made a $1 million U.S. dollar contribution to the super PAC promoting Mitt Romney's candidacy in the U.S. Presidential Election 2012 through W Spann LLC, a shell corporation that rendered him anonymous. He immediately came forward to quell the controversy that arose.[34][35]
Personal life[edit]
Conard is married to Jill Davis, a two-time New York Times bestselling novelist and a former writer for the Late Show with David Letterman.[36]

Early life and education[edit]
Conard graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S.E. in Operations Research in 1978.[1] He earned his M.B.A. with distinction from Harvard Business School in 1982.[1]
Early career and Bain Capital[edit]
Prior to business school, Conard worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company. After graduating, he joined Bain & Company, the Boston-based global management-consulting firm, eventually becoming a vice president and leading the firm’s industrial practice.[2]
Conard left Bain in 1990 to become a director at Wasserstein Perella & Co., a boutique investment bank. At Wassernstein, he headed the firm's Transaction Development Group.[2]
Conard was a managing director at Bain Capital, the head of Bain's New York office and the leader of its industrial practice.[3] He joined the firm in 1993 prior to the firm raising $300 million of private equity.[4] When Conard retired in 2007, Bain Capital managed $75 billion of capital and had offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Mumbai.[4] His first acquisition was that of a pharmaceutical company for half a billion dollars. That same company later rose to more than $10 billion in value.[5]
While at Bain Capital, Conard took Waters Corporation, DDI, ChipPac, Innophos, and Sensata public and sat on their boards of directors.[6][7][8][9] He still sits on the board of Waters Corporation.[10]
Writing, speaking, and scholar career[edit]
Conard is the author two top-ten New York Times bestsellers: Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong and The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class. He became the tenth most searched author on Google in 2012 after publishing his first book.[11] Conard joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting fellow in 2012.[12] His work with AEI focuses on U.S. economic policy - in particular, on the effect of taxes, government policies, and finance on risk-taking and innovation.[1]
Unintended Consequences[edit]
Conard published Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong in May 2012.[13] The book was featured on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine and went on to become a New York Times top ten non-fiction bestseller.[14]
While the New York Times predicted the book might become “the most hated book of the year,”[2] leading economists such as Greg Mankiw, Andrei Shleifer, Steven Levitt, Nouriel Roubini, Tyler Cowen, and Glenn Hubbard publicly endorsed the book.[15] In contrast to the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal called the book “a full throttle defense of economic dynamism…refreshing at a time when so many take the failure of capitalism for granted.”[16] The New York Times described Unintended Consequences as “…arguing that growing income inequality shows the economy is working.” Timothy Noah, the author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality noted: “the biggest surprise, on opening Unintended Consequences, lies in discovering that this book isn't about income inequality at all.”[17] The book analyzes why the U.S. has outperformed other high-wage economies, explains the causes the financial crisis, and makes recommendations for accelerating growth in its aftermath.[13] Conard summarizes his book in a 23-minute video for The UP Experience.[18]
Since its publication, Conard has made numerous television appearances in which he has debated leading economists including Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, and Jared Bernstein; journalists including Fareed Zakaria, Chris Hayes, and Andrew Ross Sorkin; and politicians such as Barney Frank, Howard Dean, and Eliot Spitzer.[19] Conard also debated Jon Stewart for 33 minutes, one of Stewart’s longest interviews.[20] The video of the debate has received nearly 100,000 views. He has also written op-eds for The Wall Street Journal,[21] The Washington Post,[22] Foreign Affairs,[23] Harvard Business Review,[24] Fortune,[25] and Politico,[26] among others.
The Upside of Inequality[edit]
Conard published The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class in September 2016.[27] The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non-fiction list and reached #1 on the New York Times business book list.[28][29]

He is very creative in seeing some of the implications of this view. I. . .found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way."[31] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it.[32] National Review said the book is a "rousing defense of conservative beliefs about how markets and incentives drive prosperity."[33]

Early life and education[edit]
Conard graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S.E. in Operations Research in 1978.[1] He earned his M.B.A. with distinction from Harvard Business School in 1982.[1]
Early career and Bain Capital[edit]
Prior to business school, Conard worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company. After graduating, he joined Bain & Company, the Boston-based global management-consulting firm, eventually becoming a vice president and leading the firm’s industrial practice.[2]
Conard left Bain in 1990 to become a director at Wasserstein Perella & Co., a boutique investment bank. At Wassernstein, he headed the firm's Transaction Development Group.[2]
Conard was a managing director at Bain Capital, the head of Bain's New York office and the leader of its industrial practice.[3] He joined the firm in 1993 prior to the firm raising $300 million of private equity.[4] When Conard retired in 2007, Bain Capital managed $75 billion of capital and had offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Mumbai.[4] His first acquisition was that of a pharmaceutical company for half a billion dollars. That same company later rose to more than $10 billion in value.[5]
While at Bain Capital, Conard took Waters Corporation, DDI, ChipPac, Innophos, and Sensata public and sat on their boards of directors.[6][7][8][9] He still sits on the board of Waters Corporation.[10]
Writing, speaking, and scholar career[edit]
Conard is the author two top-ten New York Times bestsellers: Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong and The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class. He became the tenth most searched author on Google in 2012 after publishing his first book.[11] Conard joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting fellow in 2012.[12] His work with AEI focuses on U.S. economic policy - in particular, on the effect of taxes, government policies, and finance on risk-taking and innovation.[1]
Unintended Consequences[edit]
Conard published Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong in May 2012.[13] The book was featured on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine and went on to become a New York Times top ten non-fiction bestseller.[14]
While the New York Times predicted the book might become “the most hated book of the year,”[2] leading economists such as Greg Mankiw, Andrei Shleifer, Steven Levitt, Nouriel Roubini, Tyler Cowen, and Glenn Hubbard publicly endorsed the book.[15] In contrast to the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal called the book “a full throttle defense of economic dynamism…refreshing at a time when so many take the failure of capitalism for granted.”[16] The New York Times described Unintended Consequences as “…arguing that growing income inequality shows the economy is working.” Timothy Noah, the author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality noted: “the biggest surprise, on opening Unintended Consequences, lies in discovering that this book isn't about income inequality at all.”[17] The book analyzes why the U.S. has outperformed other high-wage economies, explains the causes the financial crisis, and makes recommendations for accelerating growth in its aftermath.[13] Conard summarizes his book in a 23-minute video for The UP Experience.[18]
Since its publication, Conard has made numerous television appearances in which he has debated leading economists including Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, and Jared Bernstein; journalists including Fareed Zakaria, Chris Hayes, and Andrew Ross Sorkin; and politicians such as Barney Frank, Howard Dean, and Eliot Spitzer.[19] Conard also debated Jon Stewart for 33 minutes, one of Stewart’s longest interviews.[20] The video of the debate has received nearly 100,000 views. He has also written op-eds for The Wall Street Journal,[21] The Washington Post,[22] Foreign Affairs,[23] Harvard Business Review,[24] Fortune,[25] and Politico,[26] among others.
The Upside of Inequality[edit]
Conard published The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class in September 2016.[27] The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non-fiction list and reached #1 on the New York Times business book list.[28][29]
The Upside of Inequality was met with positive reviews, including former president of Harvard University and economist Larry Summers, a very tough critic on the other side of the aisle, blurbed: I disagree but respect the argument, calling it "a very valuable contribution" that will "sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues."[30] Noted economist Tyler Cowen who wrote on Bloomberg News: "Conard’s central idea is that risk-bearing equity capital is the truly scarce asset in most economic situations, and economic analysis should adapt accordingly. He is very creative in seeing some of the implications of this view. I. . .found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way."[31] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it.[32] National Review said the book is a "rousing defense of conservative beliefs about how markets and incentives drive prosperity."[33]
Political activities[edit]
Conard made a $1 million U.S. dollar contribution to the super PAC promoting Mitt Romney's candidacy in the U.S. Presidential Election 2012 through W Spann LLC, a shell corporation that rendered him anonymous. He immediately came forward to quell the controversy that arose.[34][35]
Personal life[edit]
Conard is married to Jill Davis, a two-time New York Times bestselling novelist and a former writer for the Late Show with David Letterman.[36]
