(1) Offering expenses have been rounded to $100,000 and have heretofore been
    paid from the proceeds from the Company’s Private Placement Offering.

(2) Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in reserve as   
    working capital and subject to reallocation to other line item expenditures
    as required for ongoing operations. The Offering proceeds may not be used to
    discharge indebtedness.

If 100% of the offered Shares are sold the Company will receive the maximum
proceeds of $400,000 after paying the Company’s offering expenses. The Company
plans to allocate the net proceeds from this Offering as follows: $118,000
towards the salaries of the officers, directors, employees, and independent
contractors, $1600,000 for marketing, $100,000 for the purchase of our
Astaxanthin products. We will allocate $5,000 for the development of our
website, $12,000 for our Corporate office lease, and $5,000 to travel expenses.

If 75% of the offered Shares are sold the Company will receive $275,000, after
paying offering expenses. In this case, the Company plans to cut the staffing
budget to $100,000, cut the marketing expenses to $100,000, cut the purchases of
the Astaxanthin products budget to $60,000, maintain the lease expense to
$12,000, lower the website development budget to $3,000 and eliminate the travel
budget. In this instance, the Company’s president may work more on the
development of our Astaxanthin products and growing the company because we will
still have enough money to hire employees, who will be able to relieve much of
the bookkeeping and ad ministerial load.

If 50% of the offered Shares are sold the Company would receive $150,000, after
paying offering expenses. The Company would further cut the staffing budget for
the officers and directors to $18,000. The Company would not be able to hire a
full time assistant and would have to rely on temporary workers to bear some of
the ad ministerial duties and office workload, which will result in the
president allocating more time to those activities. The Company still plans on
spending $40,000 to Astaxanthin products; however, it would significantly cut
the marketing budget to $80,000 and the office lease budget to $9,000. The
Company plans to maintain the website budget at $3,000 and the travel budget
would still be eliminated.

If the Company sells 10% of the Shares under the Offering it would be severely
restricted in its operating plans and would not have sufficient proceeds to
cover offering expenses, or operate the Company for the year, and it will have
to pay the remainder of the expenses out of additional financing which it has
not yet received. The Company will not have sufficient proceeds to hire any
staff and initiate growth. In this instance, the Company will have to seek out
additional capital from alternate sources to fully execute the plan of
operations. If such funds are not available, the business would likely fail and
any investment would be lost.

The funds from this Offering may not be used to pay Bill MacGillivary, Kenneth
Lelek or Wayne Miletta for their services to the Company, prior to, during, and
subsequent to the Offering. There can be no assurance that the Company will
raise any funds through this Offering and if a limited amount of funds are
raised, the Company will use such funds according to its best judgment in
accordance with the foregoing “Use of Proceeds” chart and the explanations
thereto. This discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of
proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in
funds allocated to each specific item listed, and would not differ materially
from the “Use of Proceeds” chart. To the extent the offering proceeds do not
cover any professional fees incurred by the Company, management anticipates
paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues the
Company receive.

If the Company requires additional funding, it will seek such funds from
friends, family, and business acquaintances of the officers and directors in
order to continue operations. As with any form of financing, there are
uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds, and the likelihood that
such funds will be available to the Company on acceptable terms since the
Company has not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from
the friends, family members, or business acquaintances of the officers and
directors regarding potential investments in the Company.


The industry in which we intend to compete is subject to intense competition. We
believe that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our
ability to continually enhance and improve our products and technologies. In
order to do so, we plan to effectively utilize and expand our research and
development capabilities. Competition is based primarily on scientific and
technological superiority, technical support, availability of patent protection,
protection of trade secrets, access to adequate capital, ability to develop,
acquire and market products successfully, ability to obtain governmental
approvals and ability to serve the particular needs of customers. We intend to
compete on the basis of safety, effectiveness, convenience, manufacturing
superiority, intellectual property, and where appropriate, price.

Global production of natural Astaxanthin is dominated by four companies:

º Cyanotech, Hawaii, USA

º Parry Nutraceuticals, India

º Fuji Chemicals, Japan/Sweden

º Algatechnologies, Israel

Supply does not currently meet demand. Future supply (as defined by current and
planned supply expansions) is not likely to meet future demand (as extrapolated
from current supply gaps, the expanding range of applications and consumer
interest trends).

Also, we will compete against chemically, non-naturally produced Astaxanthin
companies. Because of the broad manifestation of inflammation in chronic
disease, numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing or
producing anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents. These companies include, but are
not limited to: AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly,
GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Nestle/Pamlab, Novartis, Pfizer, and
Takeda.

In addition to competing with non-Astaxanthin anti-inflammatory drugs, we intend
to compete with microalgal Astaxanthin nutraceutical / dietary supplement
products on the basis of our ability to purchase large quantities of Astaxanthin
from our joint venture agreement. We believe our ability to purchase Astaxanthin
from producers instead of investing in expensive production facilities will
result in higher potential sales and that we will be able to achieve those sales
at an earlier stage as we would not have to first invest in the production
facilities to produce the natural Astaxanthin.

Our success will also depend in large part on our ability to obtain
international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the
proprietary blends and trademarks that we consider important to our business. We
intend to seek appropriate patent protection for our products where applicable
by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries.
We intend for these patent applications to cover, where applicable, claims for
composition of matter, uses, processes for preparation and formulations. Our
success will also depend on our ability, and the ability of our current and/or
future partners to maintain trade secrets related to proprietary production
methods for products that we, or our partners, intend to market.

The Company is subject to other competitive risks of early stage and commercial
businesses generally, and of distribution businesses in particular, including
competing in an environment where other companies may be better financed or have
more experience that the Company.


Company Description
On February 24, 2015, we were incorporated in the State of Delaware as CleanGoal
Energy Corp. On August 15, 2016 we changed our state of incorporation of the
Company to the State of Wyoming.

Our general business strategy is aimed at building value through positioning the
Company in the future by


 organizing and operating “green technology”
subsidiaries where we will position ourselves as a niche provider of renewable
energy and of technologically advanced products or services within the green
technology area of operation. Our first area of focus will be on the purchasing
and then reselling of Astaxanthin (a product produced by growing Algae) for
cosmetic and nutraceutical / dietary supplemental uses. A nutraceutical is a
product derived from food sources with extra health benefits as well as basic
nutritional value. Currently the Company does not have any products, or services
and has not begun purchasing or distributing any Astaxanthin products. A dietary
supplement is intended to provide nutrients that may otherwise not be consumed
in sufficient quantities. The Company also anticipates updating and refining the
business strategy as new opportunities present themselves. In general, the
component functions of the business model are to:

º incrementally invest, market, and refine our Astaxanthin products;

º concentrate initial sales efforts on focused market entry opportunities; and

º increase sales to a level that establishes market acceptance, as determined by
  the Company’s management.

Clean coal technology

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Coal pollution mitigation technology)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about technological innovations related to coal pollution mitigation. For the general concept of mitigation, see Coal pollution mitigation.
Clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to attempt to help lessen the environmental impact of coal energy generation and to mitigate worldwide climate change.[1] When coal is used as a fuel source, the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury, and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used. These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal, gasification (see also IGCC), improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals (brown coals) to improve the calorific value, and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity.
Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx, the most important gases in causation of acid rain, and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health. Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,[2] potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage,[3] and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.[4][5]

Technology[edit]
Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept:

Pre-combustion capture – This involves gasification of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, which may be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2-rich gas mixture, from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,[6] This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations.[7]
Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes.
Oxy-fuel combustion – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO2 capture.[8]

The Kemper County IGCC Project, a 582 MW coal gasification-based power plant, will use pre-combustion capture of CO2 to capture 65% of the CO2 the plant produces, which will be utilized/geologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations.[9]
The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.[10]




An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO2 so that it may be stored or sequestered


An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company Vattenfall’s Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg, Germany, built by German firm Siemens, which went on-line in September 2008.[11][12] The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.[12]
Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. Callide Power Station has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology.[13] Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.[14]
Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater low-rank coals. Low-rank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent.[citation needed]
The UK government's is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country. In August 2010, UK-based company B9 Coal announced a clean coal project with 90% carbon capture to be put forward to DECC. This would help the UK raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world. This proposed project, gasifies coal underground and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then used as an emissions-free fuel to run an alkaline fuel cell whilst the carbon dioxide is captured. This UK project could provide a world-leading template for clean coal with CCS globally.
Demonstration projects in the United States[edit]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology & Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation.[15] The National Energy Technology Laboratory has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round:[16]

Round 1 CCPI Projects

Advanced Multi-Product Coal Utilization By-Product Processing Plant
Demonstration of Integrated Optimization Software at the Baldwin Energy Complex
Gilberton Coal-to-Clean Fuels and Power Co-Production Project
Increasing Power Plant Efficiency: Lignite Fuel Enhancement
TOXECON Retrofit for Mercury and Multi-Pollutant Control on Three 90-MW Coal-Fired Boilers
Western Greenbrier Co-Production Demonstration Project
Commercial Demonstration of the Airborne Process
Integration of Advanced Emission Controls to Produce Next-Generation Circulating Fluid Bed Coal Generating Unit


Round 2 CCPI Projects

Airborne Process Commercial Scale Demonstration Program
Demonstration of a Coal-Based Transport Gasifier
Mercury Species and Multi-Pollutant Control Project
Mesaba Energy Project


Round 3 CCPI Projects

American Electric Power Project
Antelope Valley Station Post-Combustion CO2 Project
Hydrogen Energy California Project
NRG Energy Project
Southern Company Carbon Capture Kemper Project
Summit Texas Clean Energy Project



These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program.[17]
According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy.[18]
Clean coal and the environment[edit]
Further information: Environmental effects of coal
According to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a major contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see World energy resources and consumption), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol will require modifications to how coal is utilized.[19]
Coal, which is primarily used for the generation of electricity,[20] is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the US.[21] The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation. The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of "traditional" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development.[22]
Some in the coal industry (C2ES) and the U.S. Department of Energy refer to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as the latest in clean coal technologies. CCS is a means to capture carbon dioxide from any source, compress it to a dense liquid-like state, and inject and permanently store it underground. Currently, there are more than 80 carbon capture and sequestration projects underway in the United States.[23] All components of CCS technology have been used for decades in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries.[by whom?] Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.[24][25]
Supporters[who?] of clean coal use the Great Plains Synfuels plant to support the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. Supporters[who?] admit that carbon sequestration is expensive.[26]

These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program.[17]
According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy.[18]
Clean coal and the environment[edit]
Further information: Environmental effects of coal
According to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a major contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see World energy resources and consumption), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol will require modifications to how coal is utilized.[19]
Coal, which is primarily used for the generation of electricity,[20] is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the US.[21] The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation. The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of "traditional" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development.[22]
Some in the coal industry (C2ES) and the U.S. Department of Energy refer to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as the latest in clean coal technologies. CCS is a means to capture carbon dioxide from any source, compress it to a dense liquid-like state, and inject and permanently store it underground. Currently, there are more than 80 carbon capture and sequestration projects underway in the United States.[23] All components of CCS technology have been used for decades in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries.[by whom?] Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.[24][25]
Supporters[who?] of clean coal use the Great Plains Synfuels plant to support the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. Supporters[who?] admit that carbon sequestration is expensive.[26]

Clean coal technology

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Coal pollution mitigation technology)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about technological innovations related to coal pollution mitigation. For the general concept of mitigation, see Coal pollution mitigation.
Clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to attempt to help lessen the environmental impact of coal energy generation and to mitigate worldwide climate change.[1] When coal is used as a fuel source, the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury, and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used. These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal, gasification (see also IGCC), improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals (brown coals) to improve the calorific value, and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity.
Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx, the most important gases in causation of acid rain, and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health. Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,[2] potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage,[3] and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.[4][5]

Technology[edit]
Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept:

Pre-combustion capture – This involves gasification of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, which may be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2-rich gas mixture, from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,[6] This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations.[7]
Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes.
Oxy-fuel combustion – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO2 capture.[8]

The Kemper County IGCC Project, a 582 MW coal gasification-based power plant, will use pre-combustion capture of CO2 to capture 65% of the CO2 the plant produces, which will be utilized/geologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations.[9]
The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.[10]




An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO2 so that it may be stored or sequestered


An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company Vattenfall’s Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg, Germany, built by German firm Siemens, which went on-line in September 2008.[11][12] The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.[12]
Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. Callide Power Station has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology.[13] Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.[14]
Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater low-rank coals. Low-rank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent.[citation needed]
The UK government's is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country. In August 2010, UK-based company B9 Coal announced a clean coal project with 90% carbon capture to be put forward to DECC. This would help the UK raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world. This proposed project, gasifies coal underground and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then used as an emissions-free fuel to run an alkaline fuel cell whilst the carbon dioxide is captured. This UK project could provide a world-leading template for clean coal with CCS globally.
Demonstration projects in the United States[edit]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology & Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation.[15] The National Energy Technology Laboratory has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round:[16]

Round 1 CCPI Projects

Demonstration of Integrated Optimization Software at the Baldwin Energy Complex
Gilberton Coal-to-Clean Fuels and Power Co-Production Project

Mesaba Energy Project


Round 3 CCPI Projects

As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal, gasification (see also IGCC), improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals (brown coals) to improve the calorific value, and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity.
Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx, the most important gases in causation of acid rain, and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health. Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,[2] potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage,[3] and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.[4][5]

Technology[edit]
Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept:

Pre-combustion capture – This involves gasification of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, which may be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2-rich gas mixture, from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,[6] This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations.[7]
Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes.
Oxy-fuel combustion – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO2 capture.[8]

The Kemper County IGCC Project, a 582 MW coal gasification-based power plant, will use pre-combustion capture of CO2 to capture 65% of the CO2 the plant produces, which will be utilized/geologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations.[9]
The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.[10]




An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO2 so that it may be stored or sequestered


An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company Vattenfall’s Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg, Germany, built by German firm Siemens, which went on-line in September 2008.[11][12] The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.[12]
Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. Callide Power Station has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology.[13] Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.[14]
Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater low-rank coals. Low-rank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent.[citation needed]
The UK government's is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country. In August 2010, UK-based company B9 Coal announced a clean coal project with 90% carbon capture to be put forward to DECC. This would help the UK raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world. This proposed project, gasifies coal underground and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then used as an emissions-free fuel to run an alkaline fuel cell whilst the carbon dioxide is captured. This UK project could provide a world-leading template for clean coal with CCS globally.
Demonstration projects in the United States[edit]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology & Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation.[15] The National Energy Technology Laboratory has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round:[16]

Round 1 CCPI Projects

Advanced Multi-Product Coal Utilization By-Product Processing Plant
Demonstration of Integrated Optimization Software at the Baldwin Energy Complex
Gilberton Coal-to-Clean Fuels and Power Co-Production Project
Increasing Power Plant Efficiency: Lignite Fuel Enhancement
TOXECON Retrofit for Mercury and Multi-Pollutant Control on Three 90-MW Coal-Fired Boilers
Western Greenbrier Co-Production Demonstration Project
Commercial Demonstration of the Airborne Process
Integration of Advanced Emission Controls to Produce Next-Generation Circulating Fluid Bed Coal Generating Unit


Round 2 CCPI Projects

Airborne Process Commercial Scale Demonstration Program
Demonstration of a Coal-Based Transport Gasifier
Mercury Species and Multi-Pollutant Control Project
Mesaba Energy Project


Round 3 CCPI Projects

American Electric Power Project
Antelope Valley Station Post-Combustion CO2 Project
Hydrogen Energy California Project
NRG Energy Project
Southern Company Carbon Capture Kemper Project
Summit Texas Clean Energy Project



These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program.[17]
According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy.[18]
Clean coal and the environment[edit]
Further information: Environmental effects of coal
According to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a major contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see World energy resources and consumption), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol will require modifications to how coal is utilized.[19]
Coal, which is primarily used for the generation of electricity,[20] is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the US.[21] The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation. The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of "traditional" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development.[22]
Some in the coal industry (C2ES) and the U.S. Department of Energy refer to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as the latest in clean coal technologies. CCS is a means to capture carbon dioxide from any source, compress it to a dense liquid-like state, and inject and permanently store it underground. Currently, there are more than 80 carbon capture and sequestration projects underway in the United States.[23] All components of CCS technology have been used for decades in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries.[by whom?] Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.[24][25]
Supporters[who?] of clean coal use the Great Plains Synfuels plant to support the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. Supporters[who?] admit that carbon sequestration is expensive.[26]

HOME  "Company surviving the ‘coaldrums’ by gasifying coal"~ Latest Article posted on June 3, 2015       Second, we are determined to help our nation alleviate thepressing air pollution and global warming problems our country faces. The clean-burning syngas we are now producing will do exactly that, and together with the clean burning syngas we will produce as a result of the Underground Coal Gasification-Carbon Capture and Storage process we have announced and for which  we have broken ground, we plan  to be producing 100,000 cubic meters of coking syn gas per hour and 180,000 cu meters of UCG produced syngas by the end of the 2015.   Thus we will make a significant contribution to the country’s well-being.Click here to see CEO's speech at UCG groundbreaking  ceremony.  技术泓利   节约泓利   服务泓利  NASDAQ:CETC          LinksHONGLI CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES CORP.

LVIn April of this year, after years of research and trials, we at Hongli made the historic and important decision to take advantage of our vast coal resources, our knowledge and expertise in producing high end coking products for steel manufacturers on the one hand and our close relationship with the North China Institute on the other hand, and the needs of China, to focus our energies on creating clean synthetic gas, syngas, in the coking process and also on producing syngas by processing our coal resources deep in the ground. We are committed to President Xi’s stated goal, which is to replace coal with cleaner energy sources. We will strive to become one of China’s leading producers of clean energy products- products capable of generating new streams of high-margin revenue for our Company.    HONGLI CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES CORP., a Florida corporation, is a vertically-integrated coal and coke processor that historically has used coal from both its own mines and that of third-party mines to produce basic and value-added coal products for steel manufacturers, power generators, and various industrial users. Most recently, Hongli has begun to produce synthetic gas during the coking process and will in 2015 begin producing syngas through its announced UCG (underground coal gasification) and CCS (carbon capture and storage).  The company also expects to begin producing Compressed Natural Gas ("CNG") in its coking gas facility in 2015.  Thus, Hongli is making the transition from an "old" energy company to a "new", green energy company through science and technology.
