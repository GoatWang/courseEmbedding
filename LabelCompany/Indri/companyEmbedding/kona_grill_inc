ORANGE, Ohio -- Another piece of the puzzle is in place as the Orange Planning & Zoning Commission, on Tuesday, approved final development plans for Kona Grill, an eatery and bar coming to the Pinecrest development.
The Kona Grill building is the 12th Pinecrest building to meet the village's approval as construction work continues on 11 buildings at the $240-million development, located east of I-271, at the Harvard Road exit.
The Kona Grill plan still requires the approval of the village engineer.
"We promised to bring new-to-the-market, new-to-the-region offerings, and we're doing that," said Brice Hamill, vice president of design and planning for Pinecrest developer Fairmount Properties.
There are nearly 40 Kona Grill locations around the world, including those in Hawaii, Puerto Rico and in several states. The nearest to the Orange location will be those in Columbus and in Liberty Township, near Cincinnati.
Kona Grill Senior Director of Architecture and Design Sky Adler, who attended the meeting, said he has designed the growing establishment's locations for the past six years and has not repeated a design. Eight Kona Grill locations opened last year, including one Adler designed in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
Kona Grill was founded in 1998 in Scottsdale, Ariz.
"We're not Hawaiian," Adler said of the menu, referring to Kona Grill's name. "We have a wide variety of food, like flatbreads, a full dinner menu and sushi. Sushi makes up about 25 percent of our food sales, and it's brought in fresh daily.
"We have a kids menu and a lot of other things to choose from. And our (patio) bar is a big part of our business."
Menu items are, on average, in the $12-$13 price range.
The plans Adler showed the commission feature a front, covered patio that measures 1,817 square feet, attached to a 7,289-square-foot main restaurant building. The structures have a fresh, angular, almost industrial appearance and come complete with unique features.
Those features include a roof over the patio that is partially retractable, and a sign that covers the entirety of the building's south wall. The wall is covered with artificial greenery, with large lights within that greenery that spell out "Kona Grill."
Kona Grill will be located in the northwest portion of the development, near a plaza, and off the drive that makes its way through Pinecrest.
Hamill said Kona Grill will be among the businesses that will be ready for operation when Pinecrest opens to the public in May, 2018.
Others who will do business at Pinecrest will include Whole Foods; the 145-room  AC Hotels by Marriott; Silverspot Cinema; Red The Steakhouse; Pottery Barn; cookware and cutlery store Williams Sonoma; City Works Eatery and Pour House; bowling, bocce and bistro Pinstripes; Vineyard Vines; furniture store  West Elm and outdoor retailer REI.
In addition to 400,000 square feet of retail space are 87 high-end apartments and 150,000 square feet of office space.

industry leader in creating and maintaining indices, and consists of the smallest 2000 stocks from the broader Russell 3000 index.


    Russell's indices differ from traditional indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or S&P 500, whose members are selected by committee, because they base membership entirely on an 
objective, rules based methodology. The 3,000 largest companies by market cap make up the Russell 3000, with the 2,000 smaller companies making up the Russell 2000. It's a simple approach that gives 
a broad, unbiased look at the small-cap market as a whole.
