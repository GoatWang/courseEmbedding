BiographiesDr. Marijn Dekkers

Zoom image

Dr. Marijn Dekkers was the first Bayer CEO to be appointed from outside the company. During his commercially and strategically successful term of office, Bayer acquired, for example, the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., floated the MaterialScience subgroup on the stock market under the name “Covestro,” and systematically focused on the Life Science businesses.

Under Dekkers’ leadership, Bayer’s previous structure - comprising a strategic management holding company and operational subgroups - was replaced by an integrated organization under the umbrella of the strong Bayer brand. Born on September 22, 1957, in Tilburg, Netherlands, Dekkers studied chemistry and chemical engineering. He began his professional career in 1985 as a scientist at the corporate research center of General Electric in the United States, gaining experience in various units of the company before joining AlliedSignal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) in 1995. In 2000, Dekkers became Chief Operating Officer of Thermo Electron Corporation, the world’s leading manufacturer of laboratory instruments (later renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. following the acquisition of laboratory supplier Fisher Scientific). As of 2002, he served as this company’s President and CEO. After spending 25 years of his career in the United States, Marijn Dekkers joined Bayer on January 1, 2010. In September 2014, as Bayer CEO, he took over the two-year presidency of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), Frankfurt.

Dekkers is a member of the Board of Directors at General Electric in the United States and Chairman of the Dutch consumer goods group Unilever.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Marijn Emmanuel Dekkers (born 22 September 1957 in Tilburg, The Netherlands) is a Dutch-American manager and chemist. He was CEO of Bayer AG from 1 October 2010 until 30 April 2016.[1] He was appointed Chairman of Unilever in April 2016.[2] He is also a member of Unilever’s Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Life[edit]
Dekkers grew up as the youngest of three children of a merchant in the Dutch city of Tilburg. After attending the local schools, St. Aloysius (primary school) and St. Odulphus (Lyceum), in 1976 he began studying chemistry at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Three years later he switched to chemical technology at Eindhoven University of Technology, where he received his master's degree and PhD in chemical engineering.[3] From 1985 he worked for General Electric (GE) in research departments in the USA and the Netherlands. In 1988 he was Research Director of the GE range of polymers and subsequently held management positions in various polymer units at GE.
In 1995, Dekkers joined Allied Signal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) and took over the management of various business units. In 2000, he became Chief Operating Officer at Boston-based Thermo Electron Corporation, one of the world's leading specialists in the manufacture of laboratory instruments. Within a short time, Dekkers implemented a complete corporate reorganization and became President and CEO in 2002. In this role he initiated further extensive restructuring measures, divesting various organizational units and strengthening the company's core business by means of targeted acquisitions, including the purchase in 2006 of the significantly larger laboratory consumables supplier Fisher Scientific. Dekkers thereby created a company (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 35,000 employees in six business groups.
On 1 January 2010 Dekkers was appointed to the board of Bayer AG and on 1 October 2010 he took over as CEO from Werner Wenning.[4]
On 3 June 2014 Bayer AG announced that its Supervisory Board had extended Marijn Dekkers' term as CEO by two years, on expiration of the initial five-year period. Dekkers cited family reasons for extending his contract only until the end of 2016.[5] He left Bayer on 30 April 2016 and was succeeded by Werner Baumann on 1 May 2016.[6] Since April 2016 he is the Chairman of Unilever. He is also a member of Unilever’s Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Dekkers is a member of the Board of Directors of General Electric in the USA. He is President of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), Frankfurt, and Vice President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Berlin. Dekkers is also a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable, two U.S.-based associations of business leaders and CEOs.
Awards and recognition[edit]
"Manager of the Year 2014" by German business magazine "Manager Magazin" [7]
"Business person of the Year 2015" by the "Finanzen Verlag" publishing group and the readers of its publications "€uro am Sonntag", "€uro" and "Börse online" [8]
"Most Innovative CEO International 2015" by the German industry's "Innovation Award" [9]
Controversy[edit]
In 2013 some controversy was sparked during a Financial Times panel discussion with relation to Bayer's kidney and liver cancer drug Nexavar.[10]
He spoke at a conference in 2014, saying[11][12]

So now, is this going to have a big effect on our business model? No, because we did not develop this product for the Indian market, let's be honest. I mean, you know, we developed this product for Western patients who can afford this product, quite honestly.[13][14][15]

Médecins Sans Frontières responded to Dekkers comment saying that it

sums up everything that is wrong with the multinational pharmaceutical industry. Bayer is effectively admitting that the drugs they develop are deliberately going to be rationed to the wealthiest patients.[16]

Dekkers replied to this, referring to the decision made by the Indian government, not to protect a patent on Nexavar and the intellectual property of Bayer. He also said:

I regret that what was a quick response from me within the framework of a panel discussion at the recent FT Pharma conference has come across in a different way as it was meant by myself. It could not be more opposite to what I want and we do at Bayer.[17]

Personal life[edit]
Dekkers holds both Dutch and U.S. citizenship. He is married and lives with his wife Andra Moffett Dekkers and his three daughters in Düsseldorf. He is a passionate tennis player.

Life[edit]
Dekkers grew up as the youngest of three children of a merchant in the Dutch city of Tilburg. After attending the local schools, St. Aloysius (primary school) and St. Odulphus (Lyceum), in 1976 he began studying chemistry at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Three years later he switched to chemical technology at Eindhoven University of Technology, where he received his master's degree and PhD in chemical engineering.[3] From 1985 he worked for General Electric (GE) in research departments in the USA and the Netherlands. In 1988 he was Research Director of the GE range of polymers and subsequently held management positions in various polymer units at GE.
In 1995, Dekkers joined Allied Signal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) and took over the management of various business units. In 2000, he became Chief Operating Officer at Boston-based Thermo Electron Corporation, one of the world's leading specialists in the manufacture of laboratory instruments. Within a short time, Dekkers implemented a complete corporate reorganization and became President and CEO in 2002. In this role he initiated further extensive restructuring measures, divesting various organizational units and strengthening the company's core business by means of targeted acquisitions, including the purchase in 2006 of the significantly larger laboratory consumables supplier Fisher Scientific. Dekkers thereby created a company (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 35,000 employees in six business groups.
On 1 January 2010 Dekkers was appointed to the board of Bayer AG and on 1 October 2010 he took over as CEO from Werner Wenning.[4]
On 3 June 2014 Bayer AG announced that its Supervisory Board had extended Marijn Dekkers' term as CEO by two years, on expiration of the initial five-year period. Dekkers cited family reasons for extending his contract only until the end of 2016.[5] He left Bayer on 30 April 2016 and was succeeded by Werner Baumann on 1 May 2016.[6] Since April 2016 he is the Chairman of Unilever. He is also a member of Unilever’s Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Dekkers is a member of the Board of Directors of General Electric in the USA. He is President of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), Frankfurt, and Vice President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Berlin. Dekkers is also a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable, two U.S.-based associations of business leaders and CEOs.
Awards and recognition[edit]
"Manager of the Year 2014" by German business magazine "Manager Magazin" [7]
"Business person of the Year 2015" by the "Finanzen Verlag" publishing group and the readers of its publications "€uro am Sonntag", "€uro" and "Börse online" [8]
"Most Innovative CEO International 2015" by the German industry's "Innovation Award" [9]
Controversy[edit]
In 2013 some controversy was sparked during a Financial Times panel discussion with relation to Bayer's kidney and liver cancer drug Nexavar.[10]
He spoke at a conference in 2014, saying[11][12]

So now, is this going to have a big effect on our business model? No, because we did not develop this product for the Indian market, let's be honest. I mean, you know, we developed this product for Western patients who can afford this product, quite honestly.[13][14][15]

Médecins Sans Frontières responded to Dekkers comment saying that it

sums up everything that is wrong with the multinational pharmaceutical industry. Bayer is effectively admitting that the drugs they develop are deliberately going to be rationed to the wealthiest patients.[16]

Dekkers replied to this, referring to the decision made by the Indian government, not to protect a patent on Nexavar and the intellectual property of Bayer. He also said:

I regret that what was a quick response from me within the framework of a panel discussion at the recent FT Pharma conference has come across in a different way as it was meant by myself. It could not be more opposite to what I want and we do at Bayer.[17]

Personal life[edit]
Dekkers holds both Dutch and U.S. citizenship. He is married and lives with his wife Andra Moffett Dekkers and his three daughters in Düsseldorf. He is a passionate tennis player.

Dr. Marijn E. Dekkers To Be New CEO Of Bayer From October 1, 2010



Werner Wenning (62), Bayer AG CEO since 2002, is to extend his contract of service by eight months to September 30, 2010, a few weeks before his 64th birthday. In its meeting on Tuesday, Bayer's Supervisory Board appointed Netherlands-born Dr. Marijn E. Dekkers (51), currently President and CEO of U.S. laboratory equipment manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., to succeed Wenning as CEO from October 1, 2010. Dekkers will join the Bayer Management Board on January 1, 2010. In a transition phase he will also serve as CEO of Bayer HealthCare, succeeding Arthur J. Higgins (52) who has decided to leave the company during the first half of 2010 for personal reasons. Higgins was appointed Chairman of the Bayer HealthCare Executive Committee on July 1, 2004, and has been CEO of Bayer HealthCare AG since January 1, 2006.
Following the Annual Stockholders' Meeting on April 30, 2010, the present CFO Klaus Kühn will take early retirement at the age of 58. The Supervisory Board has appointed Werner Baumann (46), currently a member of both the Board of Management and Executive Committee of Bayer HealthCare, to be Kühn's successor. Baumann will also join the Bayer Management Board on January 1, 2010. 
Werner Wenning, 
Chairman of the Board of Management of Bayer AG
"Mr. Wenning has very successfully steered our company for the past seven years. We are grateful to him for consenting to extend his contract of service, thereby ensuring both continuity and an adequate period of transition in these economically difficult times," stated Dr. Manfred Schneider, Chairman of the Bayer Supervisory Board. "The Supervisory Board believes that, in Dr. Dekkers, it has found a highly qualified successor to steer the fortunes of our company. His international experience, goal-oriented approach and proven management skills are very convincing qualities." 
Thomas de Win, Chairman of the Central Works Council of Bayer AG and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board, also expressed his satisfaction with the succession procedure. "A structured transition has been ensured by extending Mr. Wenning's contract of service. From the employees' point of view, we would have welcomed a longer extension as Mr. Wenning has worked closely with employee representatives over the past years to implement tremendous changes successfully and in a socially responsible manner. Following my first meeting with his successor, I am very confident that Dr. Dekkers will continue this proven approach. Bayer's employees will support him to the best 
of their ability."
Klaus Kühn, Bayer CFO
Commenting on the retirement of CFO Klaus Kühn, Dr. Schneider said: "We greatly regret the departure of Klaus Kühn who is a highly competent and respected CFO. However, we respect his decision to pursue a new route in life."
Arthur J. Higgins is also leaving Bayer at his own request. "Over the past five years, Mr. Higgins has played a key role in realigning and strengthening our health care business. For this he deserves our thanks and appreciation," said Werner Wenning. 
Dr. Marijn E. Dekkers
In Dr. Dekkers, who holds both Dutch and U.S. citizenship, Bayer is gaining as its CEO a highly experienced international manager.
Born on September 22, 1957 in the southern Dutch city of Tilburg, Dekkers studied chemistry at the universities of Nijmegen and Eindhoven on graduating from high school. As his father was the general manager of a large textile company, he recognized at an early stage the significance of international experience in career progression. 
Arthur J. Higgins, 
CEO of Bayer HealthCare AG 
Immediately after completing his Ph.D. studies in 1985, the future Bayer CEO moved to the United States to start his career in research at General Electric in Schenectady, New York. At that time, this company's R&D center employed 2,000 scientists and was one of the oldest and most respected research facilities in North America. Dekkers originally planned this position only as a way station en route to a university professorship. However, he enjoyed working in industry so much that he stayed.
Two years later, he returned to the Netherlands to work at the GE Plastics research facility in Bergen op Zoom. When the post of his former U.S. supervisor became vacant in 1988, he recrossed the Atlantic to head polymer materials research in the United States. During this time he was elected "Technologist of the Year" at GE Plastics and contributed to 30 patents. 
Dr. Dekkers held management positions in various other polymers units at GE before moving to AlliedSignal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) in 1995. For four years he subsequently headed this company's Specialty Films and Fluorine Chemicals business groups based in Morristown, New Jersey, moving in 1999 to head Electronic Materials in San Jose in California's Silicon Valley. This business group manufactures electronic components, supplying companies such as Intel and Cisco.
In 2000, Marijn Dekkers was offered the position of Chief Operating Officer with Boston-based Thermo Electron Corporation, one of the world's leading specialists in the manufacture of laboratory instruments such as chromatographs and mass spectrometers used in life science research. The offer included the perspective of becoming the company's CEO at a later date - and thus began a nine-year success story. Within a short time, Dekkers implemented a complete corporate reorganization and, when he became President and CEO as planned in 2002, the company had a workforce of 11,000 with sales of USD 2.2 billion. 
In his role as CEO he initiated further extensive restructuring measures, divesting various organizational units and strengthening the company's core business by means of targeted acquisitions, including the purchase in 2006 of the significantly larger laboratory consumables supplier Fisher Scientific. Dekkers thereby created a company which now employs 35,000 people in six business groups and generates annual sales of USD 10.5 billion. 
Two years ago, Marijn Dekkers was also elected to the Board of Directors of Biogen Idec, one of the world's leading biotechnology companies based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with offices in 27 countries.
Dr. Dekkers is married to an American and has three daughters. As a student, he was one of the best tennis players in the Netherlands, playing on a semi-professional basis in Germany's top league for a number of years. 
Werner Baumann, 
designated Bayer CFO
Werner Baumann

Future CFO Werner Baumann was born on October 6, 1962 in Krefeld, Germany. After studying economics at Aachen Technical University and Cologne University, he joined Bayer AG at Leverkusen in 1988. His first duties were in the Southwest Europe section of the Corporate Finance Department. In 1991 he transferred to Bayer Hispania Comercial in Barcelona, Spain to take up a position as controller. He became assistant to the managing director there in 1995.
One year later, Baumann moved to Bayer Corporation in Tarrytown, New York, where he was latterly Head of Business Planning & Administration in the Diagnostics Business Group.
Baumann returned to Germany in July 2002 to become a member of the Board of Management of the newly formed subgroup Bayer HealthCare (BHC). He is presently a member of this company's Executive Committee and Head of Central Administration & Organization. As a member of the management board of Bayer Schering Pharma until 2009, he actively participated in this company's integration.
Baumann is married and has four children.

Werner Wenning extends his contract by eight months 
CFO Klaus Kühn to retire on April 30, 2010 / Werner Baumann to be new CFO
BHC CEO Arthur J. Higgins to leave Bayer at his own request Leverkusen, GERMANY | September 15, 2009 | Werner Wenning (62), Bayer AG CEO since 2002, is to extend his contract of service by eight months to September 30, 2010, a few weeks before his 64th birthday. In its meeting on Tuesday, Bayer’s Supervisory Board appointed Netherlands-born Dr. Marijn E. Dekkers (51), currently President and CEO of U.S. laboratory equipment manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., to succeed Wenning as CEO from October 1, 2010. Dekkers will join the Bayer Management Board on January 1, 2010. In a transition phase he will also serve as CEO of Bayer HealthCare, succeeding Arthur J. Higgins (52) who has decided to leave the company during the first half of 2010 for personal reasons. Higgins was appointed Chairman of the Bayer HealthCare Executive Committee on July 1, 2004, and has been CEO of Bayer HealthCare AG since January 1, 2006.
Following the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 30, 2010, the present CFO Klaus Kühn will take early retirement at the age of 58. The Supervisory Board has appointed Werner Baumann (46), currently a member of both the Board of Management and Executive Committee of Bayer HealthCare, to be Kühn’s successor. Baumann will also join the Bayer Management Board on January 1, 2010.
 
Werner Wenning, Chairman of the Board of Management of Bayer AG
“Mr. Wenning has very successfully steered our company for the past seven years. We are grateful to him for consenting to extend his contract of service, thereby ensuring both continuity and an adequate period of transition in these economically difficult times,” stated Dr. Manfred Schneider, Chairman of the Bayer Supervisory Board. “The Supervisory Board believes that, in Dr. Dekkers, it has found a highly qualified successor to steer the fortunes of our company. His international experience, goal-oriented approach and proven management skills are very convincing qualities.”
Thomas de Win, Chairman of the Central Works Council of Bayer AG and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board, also expressed his satisfaction with the succession procedure. “A structured transition has been ensured by extending Mr. Wenning’s contract of service. From the employees’ point of view, we would have welcomed a longer extension as Mr. Wenning has worked closely with employee representatives over the past years to implement tremendous changes successfully and in a socially responsible manner. Following my first meeting with his successor, I am very confident that Dr. Dekkers will continue this proven approach. Bayer’s employees will support him to the best
of their ability.”
 
Klaus Kühn, Bayer CFO
Commenting on the retirement of CFO Klaus Kühn, Dr. Schneider said: “We greatly regret the departure of Klaus Kühn who is a highly competent and respected CFO. However, we respect his decision to pursue a new route in life.”
Arthur J. Higgins is also leaving Bayer at his own request. “Over the past five years, Mr. Higgins has played a key role in realigning and strengthening our health care business. For this he deserves our thanks and appreciation,” said Werner Wenning.
Dr. Marijn E. Dekkers
In Dr. Dekkers, who holds both Dutch and U.S. citizenship, Bayer is gaining as its CEO a highly experienced international manager.
Born on September 22, 1957 in the southern Dutch city of Tilburg, Dekkers studied chemistry at the universities of Nijmegen and Eindhoven on graduating from high school. As his father was the general manager of a large textile company, he recognized at an early stage the significance of international experience in career progression.
 
Arthur J. Higgins, CEO of Bayer HealthCare AG
Immediately after completing his Ph.D. studies in 1985, the future Bayer CEO moved to the United States to start his career in research at General Electric in Schenectady, New York. At that time, this company’s R&D center employed 2,000 scientists and was one of the oldest and most respected research facilities in North America. Dekkers originally planned this position only as a way station en route to a university professorship. However, he enjoyed working in industry so much that he stayed.
Two years later, he returned to the Netherlands to work at the GE Plastics research facility in Bergen op Zoom. When the post of his former U.S. supervisor became vacant in 1988, he recrossed the Atlantic to head polymer materials research in the United States. During this time he was elected “Technologist of the Year” at GE Plastics and contributed to 30 patents.
Dr. Dekkers held management positions in various other polymers units at GE before moving to AlliedSignal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) in 1995. For four years he subsequently headed this company’s Specialty Films and Fluorine Chemicals business groups based in Morristown, New Jersey, moving in 1999 to head Electronic Materials in San Jose in California’s Silicon Valley. This business group manufactures electronic components, supplying companies such as Intel and Cisco.
In 2000, Marijn Dekkers was offered the position of Chief Operating Officer with Boston-based Thermo Electron Corporation, one of the world’s leading specialists in the manufacture of laboratory instruments such as chromatographs and mass spectrometers used in life science research. The offer included the perspective of becoming the company’s CEO at a later date - and thus began a nine-year success story. Within a short time, Dekkers implemented a complete corporate reorganization and, when he became President and CEO as planned in 2002, the company had a workforce of 11,000 with sales of USD 2.2 billion.
In his role as CEO he initiated further extensive restructuring measures, divesting various organizational units and strengthening the company’s core business by means of targeted acquisitions, including the purchase in 2006 of the significantly larger laboratory consumables supplier Fisher Scientific. Dekkers thereby created a company which now employs 35,000 people in six business groups and generates annual sales of USD 10.5 billion.
Two years ago, Marijn Dekkers was also elected to the Board of Directors of Biogen Idec, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with offices in 27 countries.
Dr. Dekkers is married to an American and has three daughters. As a student, he was one of the best tennis players in the Netherlands, playing on a semi-professional basis in Germany’s top league for a number of years.
 
Werner Baumann, designated Bayer CFO
Future CFO Werner Baumann was born on October 6, 1962 in Krefeld, Germany. After studying economics at Aachen Technical University and Cologne University, he joined Bayer AG at Leverkusen in 1988. His first duties were in the Southwest Europe section of the Corporate Finance Department. In 1991 he transferred to Bayer Hispania Comercial in Barcelona, Spain to take up a position as controller. He became assistant to the managing director there in 1995.
One year later, Baumann moved to Bayer Corporation in Tarrytown, New York, where he was latterly Head of Business Planning & Administration in the Diagnostics Business Group.
Baumann returned to Germany in July 2002 to become a member of the Board of Management of the newly formed subgroup Bayer HealthCare (BHC). He is presently a member of this company’s Executive Committee and Head of Central Administration & Organization. As a member of the management board of Bayer Schering Pharma until 2009, he actively participated in this company’s integration.
Baumann is married and has four children.

      My big thing which I think a lot about, irrespective of this election, is U.S. competitiveness in the world in this global environment. It's a little bit related to my background. I am European, and I have traveled a lot in Asia and I am living here. I am looking at what has happened over the last number of years and I'm very concerned. I'm very concerned with America's position in the global competitive environment.
      
      
      
      If you sit where I sit as the CEO of a global company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, with 35,000 employees, we manufacture in 25 countries around the world. Every time we make an investment decision, we basically have a choice to make it in any country we want to make it. If we build a new factory, we can go anywhere we want. If we want to create a big new push on R&D in a certain technology area, we can essentially do it in any country we want. What I've found in the last 5 to 10 years is my own desire to do it in the U.S. has gradually eroded. It has to do with a number of things. One, talent—it is becoming harder and harder to get good technical people. That goes back to what is happening in schools right now.
It also has to do with the environment toward large corporations. Corporate taxes here are some of the highest of any country in the world. Labor availability and labor issues are a problem, not so much in the U.S. yet, but I worry about the future. There are certain European countries—the one with the really good cheese comes to mind. It's just really hard for the CEO of a global company to now say, "I'm going to build a new factory in France and I'm going to hire 500 people." Because if you do and you may want to adjust the workforce—you have no flexibility, it's tremendously expensive to do anything in terms of adjusting your workforce up or down. We're going to see more of that in the U.S. as well. So corporate taxes, labor relations, and availability of technical talent are issues that are becoming more and more urgent as we move into the next decade.

Education









It's an issue in general that the quality in public schools, K through 12, has eroded. It's particularly true for math and science education where a lot of children at the middle-school age really need to—if they're going to become scientists or engineers—pick up that interest at that particular time. There are very few dedicated teachers in public middle schools that can teach those subjects in an interesting way. You lose them before they even turn 13 years old. We are now in international testing of high school students 24th in science and 28th in math. That is a horrendous rating. Our manufacturing capability is eroding, so we must win in the area of high technology and high-level services. If we don't have the future workforce to enable that, it's going to be very hard.

Immigration

After 9/11 we've made it harder for foreigners to come and study here, to get visas, so there's no longer a pool of foreigners who can take over certain gaps in this respect. Many Chinese students now don't bother to come to the U.S. They're just going to create education in China. And China is now producing four times as many engineers as the U.S. at the moment. The next government needs to take a hard look at that and spend serious time figuring out how we can improve math and science education in the public schools in particular.





Taxes

We have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. That's probably not going to improve—it might get worse in the future. There are some things that a new government could do. One would be to declare a tax holiday on repatriated cash that a lot of international companies have overseas. We have almost half of our cash outside of this country, tied up outside of this country, because there is a tax penalty when you bring it back. There is some temporary relief now as a result of the financial crisis, but in the end to me as a long-term policy it doesn't make sense not to allow us to bring that money back. If we can't bring it back, we won't invest it here. We'll invest it somewhere else. Only when you allow it to be brought back in a tax-efficient way is there a chance we would spend it in the U.S.




Tax incentives for companies to put new factories in the U.S. combined with a better-educated workforce, long-term, is the way to [prevent outsourcing].

You read about all of the problems going on and you wonder, Where is the money going to come from for all of this if we have to bail out banks? The money you could spend on education, on environmental protection, on new energy sources, on all of this stuff, health care, that we really need to do now we're using to keep banks afloat that made a bunch of bad loans. The bad loans gave us a standard of living in the past that we're going to pay for in the future. It is paying for past sins that will make it harder for us to invest in the future at a time when we really need it. That's a challenge for any government.

Life[edit]
Dekkers grew up as the youngest of three children of a merchant in the Dutch city of Tilburg. After attending the local schools, St. Aloysius (primary school) and St. Odulphus (Lyceum), in 1976 he began studying chemistry at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Three years later he switched to chemical technology at Eindhoven University of Technology, where he received his master's degree and PhD in chemical engineering.[3] From 1985 he worked for General Electric (GE) in research departments in the USA and the Netherlands. In 1988 he was Research Director of the GE range of polymers and subsequently held management positions in various polymer units at GE.
In 1995, Dekkers joined Allied Signal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) and took over the management of various business units. In 2000, he became Chief Operating Officer at Boston-based Thermo Electron Corporation, one of the world's leading specialists in the manufacture of laboratory instruments. Within a short time, Dekkers implemented a complete corporate reorganization and became President and CEO in 2002. In this role he initiated further extensive restructuring measures, divesting various organizational units and strengthening the company's core business by means of targeted acquisitions, including the purchase in 2006 of the significantly larger laboratory consumables supplier Fisher Scientific. Dekkers thereby created a company (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 35,000 employees in six business groups.
On 1 January 2010 Dekkers was appointed to the board of Bayer AG and on 1 October 2010 he took over as CEO from Werner Wenning.[4]
On 3 June 2014 Bayer AG announced that its Supervisory Board had extended Marijn Dekkers' term as CEO by two years, on expiration of the initial five-year period. Dekkers cited family reasons for extending his contract only until the end of 2016.[5] He left Bayer on 30 April 2016 and was succeeded by Werner Baumann on 1 May 2016.[6] Since April 2016 he is the Chairman of Unilever. He is also a member of Unilever’s Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Dekkers is a member of the Board of Directors of General Electric in the USA. He is President of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), Frankfurt, and Vice President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Berlin. Dekkers is also a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable, two U.S.-based associations of business leaders and CEOs.

He spoke at a conference in 2014, saying[11][12]

So now, is this going to have a big effect on our business model? No, because we did not develop this product for the Indian market, let's be honest. I mean, you know, we developed this product for Western patients who can afford this product, quite honestly.[13][14][15]

Médecins Sans Frontières responded to Dekkers comment saying that it

sums up everything that is wrong with the multinational pharmaceutical industry. Bayer is effectively admitting that the drugs they develop are deliberately going to be rationed to the wealthiest patients.[16]

Dekkers replied to this, referring to the decision made by the Indian government, not to protect a patent on Nexavar and the intellectual property of Bayer. He also said:

I regret that what was a quick response from me within the framework of a panel discussion at the recent FT Pharma conference has come across in a different way as it was meant by myself. It could not be more opposite to what I want and we do at Bayer.[17]

Personal life[edit]
Dekkers holds both Dutch and U.S. citizenship. He is married and lives with his wife Andra Moffett Dekkers and his three daughters in Düsseldorf. He is a passionate tennis player.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Marijn Emmanuel Dekkers (born 22 September 1957 in Tilburg, The Netherlands) is a Dutch-American manager and chemist. He was CEO of Bayer AG from 1 October 2010 until 30 April 2016.[1] He was appointed Chairman of Unilever in April 2016.[2] He is also a member of Unilever’s Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Life[edit]
Dekkers grew up as the youngest of three children of a merchant in the Dutch city of Tilburg. After attending the local schools, St. Aloysius (primary school) and St. Odulphus (Lyceum), in 1976 he began studying chemistry at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Three years later he switched to chemical technology at Eindhoven University of Technology, where he received his master's degree and PhD in chemical engineering.[3] From 1985 he worked for General Electric (GE) in research departments in the USA and the Netherlands. In 1988 he was Research Director of the GE range of polymers and subsequently held management positions in various polymer units at GE.
In 1995, Dekkers joined Allied Signal (subsequently Honeywell International Inc.) and took over the management of various business units. In 2000, he became Chief Operating Officer at Boston-based Thermo Electron Corporation, one of the world's leading specialists in the manufacture of laboratory instruments. Within a short time, Dekkers implemented a complete corporate reorganization and became President and CEO in 2002. In this role he initiated further extensive restructuring measures, divesting various organizational units and strengthening the company's core business by means of targeted acquisitions, including the purchase in 2006 of the significantly larger laboratory consumables supplier Fisher Scientific. Dekkers thereby created a company (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 35,000 employees in six business groups.
On 1 January 2010 Dekkers was appointed to the board of Bayer AG and on 1 October 2010 he took over as CEO from Werner Wenning.[4]
On 3 June 2014 Bayer AG announced that its Supervisory Board had extended Marijn Dekkers' term as CEO by two years, on expiration of the initial five-year period. Dekkers cited family reasons for extending his contract only until the end of 2016.[5] He left Bayer on 30 April 2016 and was succeeded by Werner Baumann on 1 May 2016.[6] Since April 2016 he is the Chairman of Unilever. He is also a member of Unilever’s Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Dekkers is a member of the Board of Directors of General Electric in the USA. He is President of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), Frankfurt, and Vice President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Berlin. Dekkers is also a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable, two U.S.-based associations of business leaders and CEOs.
Awards and recognition[edit]
