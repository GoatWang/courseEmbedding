Ratios valuation of Hubeiyichang Transportation Group Co., Ltd. ( 002627 | CHN)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is very commonly used for business valuation as it indicates whether a company may be undervalued or overvalued compared to industry peers. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value. (Enterprise Value vs. Market Capitalization)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Hubeiyichang Transportation Group Co., Ltd. is significantly lower than the median of its peer group: around 12.00. According to these financial ratios Hubeiyichang Transportation Group Co., Ltd.'s valuation is way below the market valuation of its peer group.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Hubeiyichang Transportation Group Co., Ltd. is significantly lower than the average of its sector (Travel & Tourism): 9.65.
