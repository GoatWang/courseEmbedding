Mr. Florance is a recognized authority for analysis of real estate markets. While leading CoStar Group, he has identified, negotiated, and closed more than 20 acquisitions across six countries. He is a frequent speaker on commercial real estate at industry events.

He conceived of and co-authored the study resulting in the 2010 launch of the CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices (CCRSI), which is believed to be the most comprehensive and thorough commercial real estate repeat-sale price index available in the market today.

The study, which was published in The Journal of Real Estate Portfolio Management, was selected by the ARES as the "Best Paper" published in this prestigious academic real estate journal in 2008. The groundbreaking study was also cited as a critical factor in the Company's selection as the only commercial real estate-related company to win an ENERGY STAR award for excellence from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009. In addition, Mr. Florance is the recipient of numerous other awards recognizing his accomplishments as an entrepreneur and corporate leader, including: Cornell Real Estate Review's Real Estate Industry Executive of the Year for 2009; Transwestern's 2007 Public Company Trendsetter of the Year for revolutionizing the way the commercial real estate industry gathers, analyzes and uses information on commercial property and markets; and Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2000 for his pioneering work in real estate information services.

Andrew C. Florance
Founder, Director, President and CEO
CoStar Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: CSGP)

Andrew C. Florance founded CoStar Group, Inc., in 1987, fundamentally changing the way commercial real estate professionals access, use and share information. Through CoStar, Mr. Florance pioneered the concept of commercial real estate firms outsourcing research functions to a third-party information provider, combining the operational efficiencies of a computer-based information system with the more complete, standardized and higher quality property information produced by the industry’s first independent research organization. Mr. Florance’s enduring commitment to innovation was recently recognized by Forbes magazine, which named CoStar among the 100 Most Innovative Growth Companies in the world, placing it among the top 10 companies within the Software & Services category in its most recent annual list.
As Founder and Chief Executive, Mr. Florance has directed CoStar’s successful expansion from start-up, to its successful IPO in July 1998, and to its market-leading position today as a publicly traded enterprise (Nasdaq: CSGP) and the leading provider of commercial real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces. CoStar’s major holdings include LoopNet, the most heavily trafficked online commercial real estate marketplace with more than 10 million registered members, and Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder.com and ApartmentHomeLiving.com, which together form the premier online apartment resource for renters seeking great apartment homes and provide property managers and owners with a proven platform for marketing their properties. CoStar operates websites with over 22 million unique monthly visitors in aggregate (as of January 2016.) Headquartered in Washington, DC, the Company maintains offices throughout the U.S., in Europe and in Toronto with a staff of approximately 2,600 worldwide.
Throughout his career, Mr. Florance has been a leader in raising awareness of energy efficiency and sustainability within the commercial property sector.  He conceived and co-authored the first comprehensive analysis of leasing and sales activity in energy-efficient office buildings in the United States. The study, which was published in the Journal of Real Estate Portfolio Management, was selected by the American Real Estate Society as the “Best Paper” published in the prestigious academic real estate journal in 2008.  The groundbreaking study was also cited as a critical factor in CoStar Group’s selection as the only commercial real estate-related company to win an ENERGY STAR Award for Excellence from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009. 
In addition, Mr. Florance has received numerous other awards and distinctions recognizing his accomplishments as an entrepreneur, innovator and corporate leader, including:

Honored by Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America (LEDA) for his entrepreneurial leadership and commitment to education.
Recognized for conceiving and co-authoring two other award-winning studies, including the first analysis to use direct measurement of commercial property to document the full size and scope of the U.S. commercial real estate market as an $11 trillion asset class. In another study, Florance and his co-authors used repeat-sale regression analysis to study price movements within CoStar’s extensive commercial property sales database. The study resulted in the formation of the CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices (CCRSI), believed to be the most comprehensive and thorough commercial real estate repeat-sale price index available in the market today. In 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System included the CCRSI in the analysis used to produce the “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,” considered to be an important and valuable indicator of economy-wide performance. Both studies were published in the Journal of Real Estate Portfolio Management, and selected by the American Real Estate Society for “Best Paper” awards.


Recognized by the Washington Business Journal for his role in directing the 2010 acquisition of CoStar Group’s headquarters building at 1331 L Street, NW, in Washington, DC, which selected the transaction as the “Best Real Estate Deal-Urban Office Sale of 2010.”
Named Real Estate Industry Executive of the Year in 2009 by the Cornell Real Estate Review;


Recognized for leading CoStar to its ranking among the 50 fastest growing Maryland technology companies by Deloitte & Touche for 10 consecutive years, and its selection by Business 2.0 magazine as one of the 100 fastest-growing public technology companies;  
Named Transwestern's 2007 Public Company Trendsetter of the Year; 
Honored by Commercial Real Estate Women (CREW) with its 15th Anniversary Award for industry innovation and recognized by Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2000;
Awarded a prize from NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, for his contribution to a white paper examining the potential impacts of 9-11 on investment-grade office buildings;
Awarded two patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for developing mobile information gathering systems for collecting comprehensive commercial real estate information in the field.

Mr. Florance currently serves on the Governing Board for Management Leadership for Tomorrow, dedicated to helping strengthen diverse business recruitment and retention efforts.  He also serves on the Board of Directors of the American Real Estate Society, a leading association of real estate thought leaders. 
In addition, Mr. Florance is active in a broad range of cultural, educational and community service endeavors. He currently is the co-chair of “The Bunny Mellon Healing Garden Dedicated to the First Ladies of the United States," a project to transform a gravel rooftop at Children’s National in Washington, DC, into a 7,200-square-foot outdoor space for comfort, play, healing and peace. Together with his wife, Heather, the Florances worked to engage Mrs. Michelle Obama, Mrs. Laura Bush, Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mrs. Barbara Bush, the late Mrs. Nancy Reagan, and Mrs. Rosalynn Carter to serve as honorary chairs of the Healing Garden.
Mr. Florance also serves as a member of the St. Albans School Governing Board and the Children’s Hospital Foundation Board and he is a member of the Cathedral Chapter overseeing the Washington National Cathedral. Previously Mr. Florance served as a Chair of the Governing Board for Beauvoir, the National Cathedral Elementary School, and as a trustee for the National Building Museum, Ford’s Theater and Shakespeare’s Theatre in Washington, DC, as well as for The St. Andrews School in Middletown, Delaware.

Mr. Florance, 46, is a founder and the chief executive of the CoStar Group, a provider of data, marketing and analytic services to the commercial real estate industry.CoStar, which is based in Washington and has offices worldwide, has been a publicly traded company since 1998.Q Judging by CoStar’s stock price and revenue, business has been good, even in the downturn.A We probably saw 1,000 to 2,000 customers go away during the downturn. But in recent quarters we’ve actually been growing our net customer base. About 86,000 people are now using our system. And our renewal rate is approximately 90 percent.When the market was going up, nobody had to analyze anything — you just buy something, sell it later and make money. Now all of a sudden people are like, “Oh, my gosh, we just lost our shirt!” They are buying data they should have bought before.

Q Who are your clients?A Our clients include the who’s who of commercial real estate. CoStar has about 20 products. You can buy different modules, for instance, if you’re an appraiser or a broker. The average customer pays about $1,000 a month. Continue reading the main story

Q The cornerstone of CoStar’s business is data. How do you continually track properties? A We have about 800 researchers who specialize in geographies — they’re interviewing hundreds of thousands of players in the business constantly. And we have a fleet of Priuses that visit literally millions of properties.We’re also in all the courthouses and read all the S.E.C. filings. But the root of it is the intelligent researcher who looks at all these threads of data and pulls together the story.Q How so?A It’s a connective process:We learn about a listing and the broker volunteers pieces of information. We’ll ask additional questions and keep checking back. We may learn a property has been leased, and we’ll ask who leased it. We’ll investigate the building that tenant came from, and then we look to see if there’s space available there, and so on. The threads can go 10, 15, 20 deep before the trail stops.

Q Two years ago CoStar reached the million mark in listings. What’s the number now? A There are 1.4 million listings, which is a mind-boggling number. About 460,000 of the properties are for sale, a million for lease. Or, roughly $500 billion for sale and $500 billion for lease. More than 10 percent of this dollar value is in New York. The biggest categories are office leases, then probably industrial and retail.Q How long do these listings stay on the market? A In the United States over all it’s about 400 days for a property to lease, with New York running at about 300 days.

Anecdotally, we came up to New York to look at buildings eight months ago — we are relocating our New York office — and I came back up again recently to look again, and there appear to be roughly the same spaces available today that were available eight months ago.Q Let’s talk about numbers in the New York area. A We track around 140,000 buildings in the tristate area in our system. Right now we’re running at about an 8 percent vacancy rate in the Manhattan office market. The retail market is about two percentage points lower.The rate is not so terrible, however rents have gone down. The average rent in a typical Class A office building in New York peaked above $70 a square foot, up from an average $50 in 2006. Now it’s back at $50. At the peak, the vacancy rate got as low as 2 percent. The only other city to hit that level was San Francisco during the dot-com boom. San Francisco has never gotten back to those numbers.

Q Did you utilize your extensive resources in buying your new Washington headquarters, for $41 million in cash, from the Mortgage Bankers Association? A I know that we analyzed it, and it’s a good value. It’s the lowest price paid for a Class A office building in Washington in a decade — about $290 or so a square foot, including the land lease. We had probably a dozen Ph.D.’s working on the potential acquisition of the building.Q You started the company in your Princeton dorm in 1986. Did that help pay for school? A I paid for a lot of my own education. You could make one amount of money washing dishes in the student cafeteria and you could make a different amount of money running discounted cash-flow analysis for commercial real estate on $30 million portfolios. So I was lucky. I got some summer jobs working in real estate, and it was the right time.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
