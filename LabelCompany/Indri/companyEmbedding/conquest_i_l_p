4.0 out of 5 starsConquest your soul..ByGianfranco Luizon October 12, 2009This record is called as one of the worst records from Heep...I do not agree with that, there's a lot of beautiful and powerfull sounds here: Bass lines over the average, strange and nice voices coming around, keyboard songs, Box guitar...As a lot of Heep material, you have to listen several times, closing your yes and then, the magic happens...It was about 15 years since the last time that I could listen this (listen isn't the correct word, FEEL is more apropriated) and I have to say: Thank You guys from Amazon to make this possible, since I'm here in Brazil and this record is not available at my garden window.From Curitiba - BrasilMy heep regardsGianfranco

3.0 out of 5 starsConquestByMarkus Olanderon May 22, 2011I discovered Uriah Heep in the late 80's but it took me a while to buy their cd's. "Conquest" is not a Uriah Heep classic like "Demons and wizards", but there are some good tracks on the album, like "Feelings", "Carry on" and "Won't have to wait too long". Overall, it's still worth the money.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsBest Heep disc, but...ByburritobrotherVINE VOICEon February 7, 2008Format: Audio CD|Verified Purchase"Conquest" was my first Uriah Heep album and it remains my personal favorite, although I realize fans who share my opinion could all fit in a phone booth and still have room for some friends. This review is about this particular reissue. The sound is improved from the 1997 remaster, and there's a previously unreleased live track at the end. That is nice in and of itself, but it comes at the expense of a great single ('My Joanna Needs Tuning') that was on the previous issue. Also, 'Lying' is completely remixed on this one. It's a good enough remix, but it's a remix nonetheless so be forewarned.A couple of very strange decisions with this version of "Conquest", but it's still great that the album is available.0Comment|
