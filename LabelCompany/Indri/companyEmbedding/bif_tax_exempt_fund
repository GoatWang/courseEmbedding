Your clients are living longer, and many of them haven't saved enough. Use our Principles for Successful Long-Term Investing to talk to them about this reality, and to help them be prepared.
ACCESS ALL 7 PRINCIPLES







 














We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

Studies reveal that individuals do not feel adequately prepared for retirement. Investors should start early by saving more, investing with discipline and having a plan for their future.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund 
  Tax-Exempt Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing in a diversified
portfolio of high quality, short-term, tax-exempt securities. These securities consist principally of tax-exempt notes and commercial paper, short-term tax-exempt bonds, tax-exempt variable rate demand obligations and short-term
tax-exempt derivatives. Certain short-term securities have maturities that are longer than 397 days, but give the Fund the right to demand payment from a financial institution within that period. The Fund treats these securities as having a maturity
of 397 days or less. The Funds dollar-weighted average maturity will be 60 days or less and the dollar-weighted average life of all of its investments will be 120 days or less. 
  Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in short-term
tax-exempt securities or so that at least 80% of the income it distributes will be exempt from Federal income tax (including the Federal alternative minimum tax). The Fund also may invest up to 20% of its assets in short-term municipal securities,
which may subject investors to Federal alternative minimum tax. Throughout this prospectus, interest paid on tax-exempt and/or municipal securities may be referred to as tax-exempt. 
  The Fund does not presently intend to invest more than 25% of its total assets in
short-term tax-exempt securities of issuers located in a single state.

Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund
   Tax-Exempt
Fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve its objectives.    An investment
in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund could lose money if the issuer of an instrument held by the Fund defaults or if
short-term interest rates rise sharply in a manner not anticipated by Fund management. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The following is a
summary description of certain risks of investing in the Fund.   


n
 
 Credit Risk  Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal
when due. Changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Funds investment in that issuer. 
 


n
 
 Income Risk  Income risk is the risk that the Funds yield will vary as short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds
are reinvested in securities with different interest rates.   


n
 
 Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise. In general, the
market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter term securities. 
 


 
Additionally, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of
principal if held to maturity. However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period shareholders own shares of the Fund. 
 


n
 
 Market Risk and Selection Risk  Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including
the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with
similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.   


n
 
 Municipal Securities Risks  Municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of
information about certain issuers of municipal securities, and the possibility of future legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Certain municipal securities, including private activity bonds, are not
backed by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the issuer. Additionally, if events occur after the security is acquired that impact the securitys tax-exempt status, the Fund and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax
liabilities.   


n
 
 Taxability Risk  Future laws, regulations, rulings or court decisions may cause interest on tax-exempt or municipal securities to be subject,
directly or indirectly, to Federal income taxation or may otherwise prevent the Fund from realizing the full current benefit of the tax-exempt status of such securities. Any such change could also affect the market price of such securities, and thus
the value of an investment in the Fund.   


n
 
 Variable Rate Demand Obligations and Municipal or Tax-Exempt Derivatives Risk  Investments in variable rate demand obligations or short-term
municipal or tax-exempt derivatives involve credit risk with respect to the financial institution providing the Fund with the right to demand payment or put (sell) the security. While the Fund invests only in short-term municipal or tax-exempt
securities of high quality issuers, or which are backed by high quality financial institutions, those issuers or financial institutions may still default on their obligations. Short-term municipal or tax-exempt derivatives present certain unresolved
tax, legal, regulatory and accounting issues not presented by investments in other short-term municipal or tax-exempt securities. These issues might be resolved in a manner adverse to the Fund.

Performance Information 
  The information shows you how Tax-Exempt Funds performance has varied year by
year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Information for the periods before February 2003 (when the Fund changed to a master/feeder structure) reflects the Funds operations as a stand alone fund. As
with all such investments, past performance is not an indication of future results. The table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Funds investment manager and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain
Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund's results can be obtained by visiting www.blackrock.com/moneymarketreports or can be obtained by phone at (800) 626-1960. The Fund is
a money market fund managed pursuant to the requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Effective May 28, 2010, Rule 2a-7 was amended to impose new liquidity, credit
quality and maturity requirements on all money market funds. Fund performance shown prior to May 28, 2010 is based on Investment Company Act rules then in effect and is not an indication of future returns.

Investment Manager 
  Tax-Exempt Funds investment manager is BlackRock Advisors, LLC
(BlackRock). The Funds sub-adviser is BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Where applicable, BlackRock refers also to the Funds sub-adviser. 
  Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares
   If you are
a Cash Management Account (CMA) service subscriber, there is no minimum initial investment for Fund shares. The minimum assets for the CMA service is $20,000 in cash and/or securities. Other programs may have different minimum asset
requirements. If you are not a CMA service or other Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch) central asset account program subscriber, the minimum initial investment for the Fund is $5,000. If you are an
eligible CMA service subscriber and you choose to have your cash balances automatically invested in the Fund, generally cash balances of more than $1 in a CMA account are automatically invested in shares of the Fund daily at the next determined net
asset value on each business day on which both the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange) and New York banks are open; cash balances of less than $1 will be automatically invested in shares of the Fund at the next determined net asset
value not later than the first business day of each week on which both the Exchange and New York banks are open, which will usually be a Monday. If you are a CMA service or other eligible Merrill Lynch central asset account program subscriber, you
may make manual investments of $1,000 or more at any time in shares of any fund associated with the CMA service not designated as your primary money account. Generally, manual purchases placed through Merrill Lynch will be effective on the day
following the day   
4 



the order is placed with the Fund, subject to certain timing considerations. If you are a CMA service subscriber, you may redeem your shares by directly submitting a written notice of redemption
to Merrill Lynch, which will submit the request to the Funds transfer agent. You may sell shares held at the Funds transfer agent by writing to Financial Data Services, Inc., P.O. Box 45290, Jacksonville, Florida 32231-5290. 
  Tax Information
   The Fund
will distribute dividends of net investment income, if any, daily and net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually. The Fund anticipates that most of its distributions will be excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes.
   Payments to Broker/Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
   If you
purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary, the Fund and BlackRock Investments, LLC, the Fund's distributor, or its affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These
payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other financial intermediary and your individual financial professional to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial professional or visit
your financial intermediary's website for more information.

Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund

Tax-Exempt Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by
investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality, short-term, tax-exempt securities. These securities consist principally of tax-exempt notes and commercial paper, short-term tax-exempt bonds, tax-exempt variable rate demand obligations and
short-term tax-exempt derivatives. Certain short-term securities have maturities that are longer than 397 days but give the Fund the right to demand payment from a financial institution within that period. The Fund treats these securities as having
a maturity of 397 days or less. The Fund’s dollar-weighted average maturity will be 60 days or less, and the dollar-weighted average life of all of its investments will be 120 days or less.
Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of
its assets in short-term tax-exempt securities or so that at least 80% of the income it distributes will be exempt from Federal income tax (including the Federal alternative minimum tax). The Fund also may invest up to 20% of its assets in
short-term municipal securities, which may subject investors to the Federal alternative minimum tax. Throughout this prospectus, interest paid on tax-exempt and/or municipal securities may be referred to as “tax-exempt.”
The Fund does not presently intend to invest more than 25% of
its total assets in short-term tax-exempt securities of issuers located in a single state.

Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund

Tax-Exempt Fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve its
investment objective. An investment in the Fund is not a
deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund could lose money if the issuer of an instrument held by the Fund defaults or if short-term interest rates rise
sharply in a manner not anticipated by Fund management. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The following is a summary description of principal
risks of investing in the Fund. 


■ 
Credit Risk — Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the
market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. 

■ 
Income Risk — Income risk is the risk that the Fund’s yield will vary as short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest rates.


■ 
Interest Rate Risk — Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise. In general, the market price of debt securities with
longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter-term securities. 

  
Additionally, securities
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value
of such securities may vary during the period shareholders own shares of the Fund. 

■ 
Market Risk and Selection Risk
— Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably.
Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may
lose money. 

■ 
Municipal Securities Risk — Municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of information about certain issuers of municipal securities, and the possibility of
future legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Certain municipal securities, including private activity bonds, are not backed by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the issuer. Additionally, if
events occur after the security is acquired that impact the security’s tax-exempt status, the Fund and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax liabilities. 

■ 
Regulatory Risk — In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) adopted amendments to money market fund regulations, which imposed new liquidity, credit quality, and maturity
requirements on all money market funds. In addition, in June 2013, the SEC proposed additional reforms to money market fund regulation, which, if adopted, may affect the Fund’s operations and/or return potential. 

■ 
Taxability Risk — Future laws, regulations, rulings or court decisions may cause interest on tax-exempt or municipal securities to be subject, directly or indirectly, to Federal income taxation or interest on
state municipal securities to be subject to state or local income taxation, or the value of state municipal securities to be subject to state or local intangible personal property tax, or may otherwise prevent the Fund from realizing the full
current benefit of the tax-exempt status of such securities. Any such change could also affect the market price of such securities, and thus the value of an investment in the Fund. 

■ 
Variable Rate Demand
Obligations and Municipal or Tax-Exempt Derivatives Risk — Investments in variable rate demand obligations or short-term municipal or tax-exempt derivatives involve credit risk with respect
to the financial institution providing the Fund with the right to demand payment or put (sell) the security. While the Fund invests only in short-term municipal or tax-exempt securities of high quality issuers, or which are backed by high quality
financial institutions, those issuers or financial institutions may still default on their obligations. Short-term municipal or tax-exempt derivatives present certain unresolved tax, legal, regulatory and accounting issues not presented by
investments in other short-term municipal or tax-exempt securities. These issues might be resolved in a manner adverse to the Fund.  
Performance Information

The information shows you how Tax-Exempt Fund’s
performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Information for the periods before February 2003 (when the Fund changed to a “ master/feeder” structure) reflects the Fund’s
operations as a standalone fund. As with all such investments, past performance is not an indication of future results. The table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Fund’s investment manager and its affiliates had not
waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these  
3  


 
periods, the Fund’s returns would have been lower. The Fund is a money
market fund managed pursuant to the requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Effective May 28, 2010, Rule 2a-7 was amended to impose new liquidity, credit quality and
maturity requirements on all money market funds. Fund performance shown prior to May 28, 2010 is based on Investment Company Act rules then in effect and is not an indication of future returns. Updated information on the Fund’s results can be
obtained by visiting www.blackrock.com/moneymarketreports or can be obtained by phone at (800) 626-1960.

Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares

If you are a Cash Management Account® (“CMA®”) service subscriber, there is no minimum initial investment for Fund shares. The minimum assets for the
CMA® service is $20,000 in cash and/or securities. Other programs may have different minimum asset requirements. If you are not a
CMA® service or other Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“Merrill Lynch”) central asset account program subscriber, the minimum initial investment for a
Fund is $5,000. If you are an eligible CMA® service subscriber and you choose to have your cash balances automatically invested in a Fund, generally cash balances of more than $1 in a
CMA® account are automatically invested in shares of a Fund daily at the next determined net asset value on each business day on which both the New York Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”) and New York banks are open; cash balances of less than $1 will be automatically invested in shares of a Fund at the next determined net asset value not later than the first business day of each week on which both the
Exchange and New York banks are open, which will usually be a Monday. If you are a CMA® service or other eligible Merrill Lynch central asset account program subscriber, you may make
manual investments of $1,000 or more at any time in shares of any fund associated with the CMA® service not designated as your primary money account. Generally, manual purchases placed
through Merrill Lynch will be effective on the day following the day the order is placed with the Fund, subject to certain timing considerations. If you are a CMA® service subscriber,
you may redeem your shares by directly submitting a written notice of redemption to Merrill Lynch, which will submit the request to the Fund’s  
4  


 
transfer agent. You may sell shares held at the Fund’s transfer agent
by writing to Financial Data Services, Inc., P.O. Box 45290, Jacksonville, Florida 32231-5290.
Tax Information

The Fund will distribute dividends of net investment income,
if any, daily and net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually. The Fund anticipates that most of its distributions will be excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes.
Payments to Broker/Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries 
If you purchase shares of a Fund through a broker-dealer or
other financial intermediary, the Fund and BlackRock Investments, LLC, the Fund’s distributor, or its affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by
influencing the broker-dealer or other financial intermediary to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial intermediary or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.

Your clients are living longer, and many of them haven't saved enough. Use our Principles for Successful Long-Term Investing to talk to them about this reality, and to help them be prepared.
ACCESS ALL 7 PRINCIPLES







 














We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

Studies reveal that individuals do not feel adequately prepared for retirement. Investors should start early by saving more, investing with discipline and having a plan for their future.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
