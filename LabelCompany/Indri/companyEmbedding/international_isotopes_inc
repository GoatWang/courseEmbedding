» I3odine/MAXTM
International Isotopes Inc. has submitted an abbreviated new drug application (aNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its I3odine/MAXTM sodium iodide radiopharmaceutical product.  This is the first application submitted to the FDA by any company for a generic sodium iodide product, and the FDA has indicated they will complete an expedited review of the aNDA.
For many decades sodium iodide has proven itself to be an essential product for the treatment and diagnosis of diseases of the thyroid, thyroid cancer, and hyperthyroidism and for use in investigational and clinical trials for the treatment of breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. We believe that, if approved, our I3odine/MAXTM product will offer numerous distinct advantages to patients, pharmacies, and hospitals.
Advantages include:

*  Highest concentration product available (up to 3500 mCi/ml)
*  Extended 30 day shelf life
*  Variable vial sizes and quantities per customer order
*  Two days of pre-calibration included from time of shipment from INIS


» Cobalt and Radiochemical Products
We bring the benefits of nuclear technology to a wide variety of medical and industrial applications. Our cobalt products are used by a broad array of companies for radiation treatment of cancer and vascular deformities of the brain. Cobalt sources are also used for container security examinations at our sea ports and borders. Our radiochemicals, such as Iodine-131, are used in a variety of chemical, industrial and medically related applications.
» Nuclear Medicine Calibration Standards
Calibration standards are used for a range of applications in nuclear pharmacy from testing of imaging machines to calibration of patient dose measurement devices. These products help ensure that nuclear medicine pharmacies, procedures, and devices perform as intended to offer safe and effective patient treatment, therapy, or imaging. We are a contract manufacturer to RadQual LLC for many of these products. Please visit their website for more information.

Announces Financial Results For The First Quarter 2017PR NewswireMay 16, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareIDAHO FALLS, Idaho, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- International Isotopes Inc. (INIS) (the "Company") announces its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1,834,208 as compared to $1,691,677 for the same period in 2016, an overall increase of approximately 8%. The increase in revenue for the period was led by a 61% and 51% increase in the radiochemical and radiological services segments respectively. The following provides some additional detail on the Company's four major business segments and their performance during the first quarter.Revenue from the sale of radiochemical products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 61%. The majority of the Company's sales within this segment are from the sale of sodium iodide. The increase in revenue in the period-to-period comparison is primarily the result of a major competitor stopping the supply of that product late in 2016. The Company also reported a 6% increase in gross profit percentage and an 87% increase in net profit for the segment for the period compared to the same period in 2016. Both increases were again attributed to the increased sales volume of the sodium iodide product.Revenue from the radiological services segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 51% compared to the same period in 2016. Our radiological services segment consists of radiological field service work and gemstone processing. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the majority of the increase in revenue was attributed to an increase in gemstone processing compared to the same period in 2016. Typically, the majority of our radiological services revenue is generated by the performance radiological field service activities in connection with the DOE's Orphan Source Recovery Program (OSRP), and the Company expects a significant increase in those contract opportunities during the remainder of 2017. Gross profit for this segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 118% and net profit increased by approximately 142% compared to the same period in 2016. Both of those increases were the result of increased revenue within this segment.Revenue from the nuclear medicine standards segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased approximately 1% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily the result of decreased sales reported by our consolidated joint venture, TI Services L.L.C. Revenue within this segment produced from sales to RadQual under our exclusive contract manufacturing agreement increased 3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. In spite of the small decline in revenue within this segment, gross profit for our nuclear medicine standards segment increased approximately 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, and net income for the segment increased by approximately 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross and net profit was attributed to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies.Revenue from the sale of cobalt products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased approximately 30% compared to the same period in 2016. Our cobalt sealed source manufacturing generates the majority of revenue in this segment and those source sales largely depend upon our ability to procure or produce high activity cobalt. Even though cobalt production at the Advanced Test reactor is underway the material will not be ready for use until 2018. Gross profit for cobalt products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased approximately 32% compared to the same period in 2016, and net income for cobalt products decreased approximately 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in gross profit and net income within this segment was directly attributed to the decrease in revenue during the period.The Company consolidated cost of sales increased approximately 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, and gross profit increased approximately 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, thus maintaining a constant 44% gross profit percentage for both periods. Operating expense increased by approximately 43% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to the significant increase in general, administrative and consulting costs, specifically legal costs and facility licensing fees.Read MoreOur net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $786,266, compared to $374,518, for the same period in 2016, an increase in loss of approximately 110%, and is primarily the result of increased operating expenses, as discussed above.Steve Laflin, President and CEO of the Company said, "We are very pleased with the strong performance of two of our major business segments during the first quarter this year and we believe there will be continued strong performance in these segments for the remainder of 2017. Specifically, within the radiological services segment we are seeing a significant increase in contract opportunities for various field service contracts both through the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We have already been successful in being awarded several of these contracts and that revenue will begin to be recognized in the second and third quarters of 2017. We also have other request for proposal responses in process that could produce additional significant revenues within this segment in 2017. In addition, we have secured some alternative sources of cobalt supply and should see resumption in cobalt source sales beginning in late 2017 or early 2018. Altogether, I believe this will result in a significant improvement in revenue for 2017."          International Isotopes Inc.

IDAHO FALLS, Idaho, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- International Isotopes Inc. (OTCQB: INIS) (the "Company") announces its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.








Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1,834,208 as compared to $1,691,677 for the same period in 2016, an overall increase of approximately 8%. The increase in revenue for the period was led by a 61% and 51% increase in the radiochemical and radiological services segments respectively. The following provides some additional detail on the Company's four major business segments and their performance during the first quarter.
Revenue from the sale of radiochemical products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 61%. The majority of the Company's sales within this segment are from the sale of sodium iodide. The increase in revenue in the period-to-period comparison is primarily the result of a major competitor stopping the supply of that product late in 2016. The Company also reported a 6% increase in gross profit percentage and an 87% increase in net profit for the segment for the period compared to the same period in 2016. Both increases were again attributed to the increased sales volume of the sodium iodide product.
Revenue from the radiological services segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 51% compared to the same period in 2016. Our radiological services segment consists of radiological field service work and gemstone processing. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the majority of the increase in revenue was attributed to an increase in gemstone processing compared to the same period in 2016. Typically, the majority of our radiological services revenue is generated by the performance radiological field service activities in connection with the DOE's Orphan Source Recovery Program (OSRP), and the Company expects a significant increase in those contract opportunities during the remainder of 2017. Gross profit for this segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 118% and net profit increased by approximately 142% compared to the same period in 2016. Both of those increases were the result of increased revenue within this segment.
Revenue from the nuclear medicine standards segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased approximately 1% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily the result of decreased sales reported by our consolidated joint venture, TI Services L.L.C. Revenue within this segment produced from sales to RadQual under our exclusive contract manufacturing agreement increased 3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. In spite of the small decline in revenue within this segment, gross profit for our nuclear medicine standards segment increased approximately 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, and net income for the segment increased by approximately 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross and net profit was attributed to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies.
Revenue from the sale of cobalt products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased approximately 30% compared to the same period in 2016. Our cobalt sealed source manufacturing generates the majority of revenue in this segment and those source sales largely depend upon our ability to procure or produce high activity cobalt. Even though cobalt production at the Advanced Test reactor is underway the material will not be ready for use until 2018. Gross profit for cobalt products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased approximately 32% compared to the same period in 2016, and net income for cobalt products decreased approximately 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in gross profit and net income within this segment was directly attributed to the decrease in revenue during the period.
The Company consolidated cost of sales increased approximately 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, and gross profit increased approximately 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, thus maintaining a constant 44% gross profit percentage for both periods. Operating expense increased by approximately 43% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to the significant increase in general, administrative and consulting costs, specifically legal costs and facility licensing fees.
Our net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $786,266, compared to $374,518, for the same period in 2016, an increase in loss of approximately 110%, and is primarily the result of increased operating expenses, as discussed above.
Steve Laflin, President and CEO of the Company said, "We are very pleased with the strong performance of two of our major business segments during the first quarter this year and we believe there will be continued strong performance in these segments for the remainder of 2017. Specifically, within the radiological services segment we are seeing a significant increase in contract opportunities for various field service contracts both through the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We have already been successful in being awarded several of these contracts and that revenue will begin to be recognized in the second and third quarters of 2017. We also have other request for proposal responses in process that could produce additional significant revenues within this segment in 2017. In addition, we have secured some alternative sources of cobalt supply and should see resumption in cobalt source sales beginning in late 2017 or early 2018. Altogether, I believe this will result in a significant improvement in revenue for 2017."

Announces 2016 Year End Financial ResultsPR NewswireMarch 31, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareIDAHO FALLS, Idaho, March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- International Isotopes Inc. (INIS) (the "Company") announces its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.RevenueTotal revenue for the Company in 2016 decreased by approximately 7% compared to 2015, primarily due to a decline in radiological services during 2016 as described below.  Additional details regarding the financial results of our business segments are discussed further in this release.Steve Laflin, President and CEO of the Company said, "While we saw a small decline in revenue for 2016, I am pleased with the significant progress we have made towards launching new products and we expect sales to increase in 2017, and beyond.  We believe our most significant accomplishment for the year was our submittal of the abbreviated New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for our I3odine/MAXTM sodium iodide (I-131) radiopharmaceutical product.  This is the first generic application in the U.S. for this product which is in strong demand for the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases of the thyroid gland such as Graves' disease, thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism.  The time frame for FDA approval is uncertain.  However, once approved, we are prepared to quickly launch full-scale commercial sales of the drug product and expect to see a positive impact to our total company revenue from the sales of this single product alone."Sales of radiochemical products accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenue in 2016.  In 2016 our revenue in this segment increased by approximately 1% and was driven largely by an 18% increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.  The large increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily the result of having a major competitor for sodium iodide stop supplying that product in October 2016.  This change in competitive outlook is expected to have a lasting positive impact on sales of that product through 2017.Cobalt product sales accounted for approximately 13% of our total sales revenue in 2016.  Sales in this segment decreased approximately 8% in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was due to the continued impact of the interruption of cobalt supply from the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and our limited options of obtaining an alternate cobalt supply.  We have identified at least one alternative short term supply of cobalt and we anticipate having a significant improvement in revenue within this segment in 2017 and 2018. Sales of nuclear medicine standards accounted for approximately 47% of our total revenue in 2016. Revenue in this segment decreased by approximately 1% in 2016 as compared to 2015 and was largely the result of the decline in sales by TI Services.  About 34% of the revenue within this segment is attributed to sales by TI Services, LLC ("TI Services"), a 50/50 joint venture that we formed with RadQual in December 2010.  The remaining 66% of revenue in this segment are produced under our exclusive manufacturing agreement with RadQual.  In 2016, revenue from TI Services declined approximately 11% while sales to RadQual increased about 5% compared to 2015.  We expect a continued small decline in TI Services sales in 2017 but anticipate continued growth in the sales to RadQual.Revenue from our radiological services segment accounted for approximately 12% of our total sales revenue in 2016.  Revenue in this segment decreased by approximately 35% compared to 2015 and this decline had the largest impact upon our 2016 revenue results.  The decline in revenue was largely attributed to the reduction in opportunities for contract awards under the DOE's Off Site Source Recovery Program (OSRP).  We anticipate a significant increase in contract opportunities under the OSRP in 2017 and also expect several international source recovery contract opportunities as well.  We have already received three award contracts under this program thus far in 2017.There was no revenue to report from the Fluorine Products segment for 2016, however, the Company still remains confident in the future opportunity for this project.  Therefore, we continue to maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and agreements within New Mexico to ensure we are in a position to rapidly resume work on this project when market conditions present the opportunity.Read MoreCost of Revenues and Gross ProfitCost of revenue for 2016 decreased approximately 15% compared to 2015, and our gross profit percentage increased to 43% for 2016, from 38% in 2015.  During 2016, we continued to monitor and control direct costs.  Raw materials used in both our radiochemical products and our nuclear medicine standards manufacturing represent the bulk of direct costs in each of these business segments.   We were able to significantly reduce the manufacturing costs in our nuclear medicine products in 2016 by decreasing scrapped material by approximately 76% which made a major impact on overall manufacturing cost.Operating Costs and ExpensesTotal operating costs and expenses for 2016 increased approximately 5% compared to 2015.   The increase was primarily attributable to increases in general administrative and consulting expenses caused by increases in waste disposal and other administrative costs during 2016.  The increase in waste disposal cost is not expected to occur again for several years.  The increase in legal expense was related to an ongoing arbitration the Company is pursuing and should conclude in the first half of 2017.Net LossOur Net Loss was $1,879,112 in 2016, compared to a Net Loss of $1,818,225 in 2015.  This is an increase in loss of approximately 3%.  Our increase in net loss is primarily the result of our decrease in revenue of approximately 7% as well as our increased expenditures for operating costs.Mr. Laflin further commented, "While we expect sales of our new I3odine/MAXTM sodium iodide product to offer long term improvement in revenue we believe we have also taken decisive steps to improve revenue in the nearer term for our cobalt products and radiological services segments.  In the radiological services segment we anticipate a significant increase in the number and size of contract opportunities for radiological field services and source recovery in 2017 under the DOE's OSRP program.  In the cobalt products segment we have been able to acquire some cobalt to resume sealed source manufacturing later in 2017 and will also begin to ship cobalt, and recognize revenue, under our agreement with the DOE beginning in mid to late 2018.  These factors should have a significant impact on overall Company revenue in 2017 and 2018." "Continuing to look even further down the road we believe that, similar to I3odine/MAXTM sodium iodide, there are several other opportunities for generic pharmaceutical products that the Company can readily manufacture.  We expect to continue to advance our pipeline of additional generic products in the coming years, and that should provide a very positive outlook for our shareholders."    International Isotopes Inc.
