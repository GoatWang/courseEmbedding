History[edit]
Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 40s, rags were replaced by shop towels—which are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags—and tablecloths. By then, the company’s name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry.[citation needed]
His grandson, Richard T. (Dick) Farmer, joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick Farmer helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983.[citation needed]
Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Today, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning.[citation needed]
The company is valued at US$12.97 billion (2017).[citation needed]
Criticism[edit]
In 2003, UNITE HERE and the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters have been engaged in a campaign against Cintas, alleging unfair labor practices. Unite obtained license numbers of Cintas workers in Pennsylvania, to contact them at home and has since been ordered to pay the workers $2,500 each. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[8] Following the death of a Tulsa, Oklahoma worker in March 2007, both unions and several Members of Congress have called for stricter health and safety standards at the company's laundries.[9][10] In May 2007, Cintas hired a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, to manage their relations with Congress.[11]

History[edit]
Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 40s, rags were replaced by shop towels—which are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags—and tablecloths. By then, the company’s name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry.[citation needed]
His grandson, Richard T. (Dick) Farmer, joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick Farmer helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983.[citation needed]
Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Today, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning.[citation needed]
The company is valued at US$12.97 billion (2017).[citation needed]
Criticism[edit]
In 2003, UNITE HERE and the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters have been engaged in a campaign against Cintas, alleging unfair labor practices. Unite obtained license numbers of Cintas workers in Pennsylvania, to contact them at home and has since been ordered to pay the workers $2,500 each. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[8] Following the death of a Tulsa, Oklahoma worker in March 2007, both unions and several Members of Congress have called for stricter health and safety standards at the company's laundries.[9][10] In May 2007, Cintas hired a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, to manage their relations with Congress.[11]

                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Cintas Corporation has received 1.03 out of 5 stars based on 20 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of F.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Cintas Corporation (/ˈsɪntəs/) is an American company with headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio that provides specialized services to businesses, primarily in North America. The firm designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom cleaning and supplies, tile and carpet cleaning, promotional products, first aid, safety, and fire protection products and services.[3] Cintas is a publicly held company traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CTAS and is a component of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.
The company is one of the largest in the industry with 35,000 employees in 2017. Revenue in fiscal year 2016 was $4.905 billion and net income was $693.52 million.[3] Fortune in the United States, named Cintas among its "Most Admired Companies" for eight consecutive years,[4] and Report on Business Magazine named the company one of Canada's Best Employers.[5]
Cintas has been featured on episodes of the reality television series Bar Rescue[6] and Hotel Impossible.[7]

History[edit]
Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 40s, rags were replaced by shop towels—which are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags—and tablecloths. By then, the company’s name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry.[citation needed]
His grandson, Richard T. (Dick) Farmer, joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick Farmer helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983.[citation needed]
Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Today, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning.[citation needed]
The company is valued at US$12.97 billion (2017).[citation needed]
Criticism[edit]
In 2003, UNITE HERE and the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters have been engaged in a campaign against Cintas, alleging unfair labor practices. Unite obtained license numbers of Cintas workers in Pennsylvania, to contact them at home and has since been ordered to pay the workers $2,500 each. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[8] Following the death of a Tulsa, Oklahoma worker in March 2007, both unions and several Members of Congress have called for stricter health and safety standards at the company's laundries.[9][10] In May 2007, Cintas hired a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, to manage their relations with Congress.[11]

History[edit]
Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 40s, rags were replaced by shop towels—which are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags—and tablecloths. By then, the company’s name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry.[citation needed]
His grandson, Richard T. (Dick) Farmer, joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick Farmer helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983.[citation needed]
Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Today, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning.[citation needed]
The company is valued at US$12.97 billion (2017).[citation needed]
Criticism[edit]
In 2003, UNITE HERE and the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters have been engaged in a campaign against Cintas, alleging unfair labor practices. Unite obtained license numbers of Cintas workers in Pennsylvania, to contact them at home and has since been ordered to pay the workers $2,500 each. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[8] Following the death of a Tulsa, Oklahoma worker in March 2007, both unions and several Members of Congress have called for stricter health and safety standards at the company's laundries.[9][10] In May 2007, Cintas hired a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, to manage their relations with Congress.[11]

History[edit]
Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 40s, rags were replaced by shop towels—which are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags—and tablecloths. By then, the company’s name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry.[citation needed]
His grandson, Richard T. (Dick) Farmer, joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick Farmer helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983.[citation needed]
Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Today, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning.[citation needed]
The company is valued at US$12.97 billion (2017).[citation needed]
Criticism[edit]
In 2003, UNITE HERE and the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters have been engaged in a campaign against Cintas, alleging unfair labor practices. Unite obtained license numbers of Cintas workers in Pennsylvania, to contact them at home and has since been ordered to pay the workers $2,500 each. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[8] Following the death of a Tulsa, Oklahoma worker in March 2007, both unions and several Members of Congress have called for stricter health and safety standards at the company's laundries.[9][10] In May 2007, Cintas hired a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, to manage their relations with Congress.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
