Retirement Series







The Portfolios that comprise Lazard Retirement Series, Inc. (the “Fund”) are intended to be funding vehicles for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies offered by the separate accounts of certain insurance companies. Those contracts and policies are described in the separate account prospectuses issued by the insurance companies, over which the Fund assumes no responsibility.
Individuals may not purchase Portfolio shares directly from the Fund.
The investment objective and policies of the Portfolio may be similar to other funds/portfolios managed or advised by Lazard Asset Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"). However, the investment results of the Portfolio may be higher or lower than, and there is no guarantee that the investment results of the Portfolio will be comparable to, any other Lazard fund/portfolio. Portfolio shares may also be offered to certain qualified pension and retirement plans and to accounts permitting accumulation of assets on a tax-deferred basis ("Eligible Plans"). Differences in tax treatment or other considerations may cause the interests of policy owners and Eligible Plan participants investing in the Portfolio to conflict. The Fund’s Board of Directors monitors the Portfolio for any material conflicts and determines what action, if any, should be taken. For information about Eligible Plan investing, call 800-823-6300.
