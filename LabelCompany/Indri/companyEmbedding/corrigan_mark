Mark Corrigan
              Biography
                

        I was born in Milwaukee Wisconsin and raised in the Town of Granville which no longer exists. I graduated from Granville High School and the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee. I took a Regular Army Commission after graduating as a Distinguished Military Student in ROTC. I served in South Korea in a HAWK Air Defense Missile before called upon to teach Advanced Marksmanship in 8th Army. I developed the concept of using Sniper Teams to control the same area as a US Army Battalion on line and helped to design the XM-21 Sniper Rifle used in Vietnam. I commanded a Hercules Missile Air Defense Unit in Union Lake Michigan, when I went to Vietnam on my "official" tour I Commanded Headquarters Company of First Field Force Vietnam. I was the Public Affairs Officer in 20th NORAD Region until I resigned my Commission on April 29, 1975 which is the day Siagon fell to the North Vietnamese. I formed Harpers Ferry Arms Company that made Civil War and Revolutionary Reproduction firearms, uniforms and equipment. Using my international contacts that made these reproductions I expanded into making other products for clients and imported them through James River Imports and Development Corporation.  During President Carter's years I could not import things cheap enough to keep these companies alive. Year's later my relationships with overseas Companies brought me into the Tobacco business and eventually into trying to help Cambodia become a modern country with major projects in Electrical Power,  Oil and Gas Production, Fertilizer and Concrete Plants and the reclaiming of the land as part of the Cambodian Veterans Rehabilitation Program.  As Virginia American Management Corporation's Executive Vice President I was within days of signing these agreements with the Cambodian Government when President Clinton who was bribed my the Communist Vietnamese Government, illegally used the North Carolina Federal Court to stop me. For the detailed true life story about all these things I  suggest that you obtain a copy of my Book "What Price Justice" Published on Smashwords.com.    

            Smashwords Interview
        



                        What are you working on next?                    

                        I published 16 books on my own website hosted by Go Daddy with very limited success. Anyone looking for a good e-book to read or an audio book would only find my website by accident as I was on page 200 of 400+ pages of e-books listed by Google. I am now converting my books into the Smashwords format. I published my first Book "What Price Justice" in August 2016. This is my true life story about Vietnam bribing President Bill Clinton to have me illegally convicted in Federal Court and the 20 year battle to receive Justice from a corrupt District Court Judge in North Carolina. I have just published the Book "Soft Touch."  This is the first book of four stories I will be publishing to add color, flavor and insights about the Vietnam era and the Cold War when the United States and Russia were looking at each other eyeball to eyeball with their fingers on the trigger of Nuclear Weapons. The main character Michael Patrick O'Neil's Radio Call Sign was "Soft Touch" when he ran the Sniper Team in Vietnam . He also becomes a "Soft Touch" when he may have sold his soul to the devil for the key to unlock Jayne's self imposed psychological isolation. The devil's price to save the love of his life required O'Neil to kill the Southeast Asian Drug Lord who is providing $20 worth of 98% pure heroin to the American GI's on the streets of South Vietnam for only a dollar. I will be publishing the other three Books The Page of Diamonds, Three Toed Tiger Tales and Blackmoon Rising very soon.                    



                        How do  you approach cover design?                    

                        I want to create an image that will draw in the reader's interests about the story and want to find out what is behind the Book's Cover.
