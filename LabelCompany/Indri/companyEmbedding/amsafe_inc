CPSC, AMSAFE Commercial Products Inc. Announce Recall of Go-Kart Seat Belts
WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), AMSAFE Commercial Products Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., is voluntarily recalling about 1,150 Murray go-karts to repair their seat belts. The seatbelts on these go-karts can unintentionally unlatch, posing a risk of serious injury to riders.

AMSAFE has not received any reports of injuries relating to this problem. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injuries.

The recall involves blue Murray Outrage go-karts with model number GT60102x92A or GT60304A, and manufacturing date codes from 00082 to 00147. The model number and date code are located on a decal behind the seat. "MURRAY" is written on the headrest of these go-karts. These go- karts are blue with neon-green pads on the brush bars.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

AmSafe

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

AmSafe Inc. is a manufacturer of air safety and securement products to the aerospace, defense, and ground transportation industries and maker of aircraft seatbelts. AmSafe makes the Aviation Inflatable Restraint (AAIR), a seatbelt airbag approved by the FAA designed to improve occupant protection from serious head injury during an otherwise unsurvivable aircraft accident. The airbag allows manufacturers and airlines to meet the FAA 16g seat retrofit rule that mandates all aircraft comply by October 2009 (1).[1]
AmSafe’s aviation products can be found on most commercial aircraft, including seat belts, restraints, cargo and barrier nets, tie-downs, and cabin interior textiles. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, AmSafe operates manufacturing and service facilities around the world. Numerous general aviation aircraft manufactures have adopted the airbag, including Mooney, Cessna and Cirrus.[2]
The company was founded by The Marmon Group. In 2004 it was purchased by an investor group led by The Pritzker Group and Admiralty Partners, Inc.. In 2007, it was further acquired by a new investment group led by Berkshire Partners and The Greenbriar Group. In 2012, it was acquired by TransDigm Group.

AmSafe

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

AmSafe Inc. is a manufacturer of air safety and securement products to the aerospace, defense, and ground transportation industries and maker of aircraft seatbelts. AmSafe makes the Aviation Inflatable Restraint (AAIR), a seatbelt airbag approved by the FAA designed to improve occupant protection from serious head injury during an otherwise unsurvivable aircraft accident. The airbag allows manufacturers and airlines to meet the FAA 16g seat retrofit rule that mandates all aircraft comply by October 2009 (1).[1]
AmSafe’s aviation products can be found on most commercial aircraft, including seat belts, restraints, cargo and barrier nets, tie-downs, and cabin interior textiles. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, AmSafe operates manufacturing and service facilities around the world. Numerous general aviation aircraft manufactures have adopted the airbag, including Mooney, Cessna and Cirrus.[2]
The company was founded by The Marmon Group. In 2004 it was purchased by an investor group led by The Pritzker Group and Admiralty Partners, Inc.. In 2007, it was further acquired by a new investment group led by Berkshire Partners and The Greenbriar Group. In 2012, it was acquired by TransDigm Group.

AmSafe Inc. is a manufacturer of air safety and securement products to the aerospace, defense, and ground transportation industries and maker of aircraft seatbelts. AmSafe makes the Aviation Inflatable Restraint (AAIR), a seatbelt airbag approved by the FAA designed to improve occupant protection from serious head injury during an otherwise unsurvivable aircraft accident. The airbag allows manufacturers and airlines to meet the FAA 16g seat retrofit rule that mandates all aircraft comply by October 2009 (1).[1]
AmSafe’s aviation products can be found on most commercial aircraft, including seat belts, restraints, cargo and barrier nets, tie-downs, and cabin interior textiles. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, AmSafe operates manufacturing and service facilities around the world. Numerous general aviation aircraft manufactures have adopted the airbag, including Mooney, Cessna and Cirrus.[2]
The company was founded by The Marmon Group. In 2004 it was purchased by an investor group led by The Pritzker Group and Admiralty Partners, Inc.. In 2007, it was further acquired by a new investment group led by Berkshire Partners and The Greenbriar Group. In 2012, it was acquired by TransDigm Group.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
