Early years[edit]
Capellas claims that he inherited a gritty determination from his father, a Greek citizen who fought with the Greek Army against the Germans in Italy in World War II.[citation needed] After the war, the elder Capellas met and married his wife, Juliet, in Italy. The family then emigrated to Ohio where Capellas' father worked his way up from laborer to superintendent at the Republic Steel Corp. My dad had an unbelievable work ethic. He was intensely loyal to the company. He worked there for 30 years, says Capellas.
As an undergraduate at Kent State University, Capellas developed an interest in computers. Shortly after he graduated with a BBA from Kent State, Capellas met his future wife, Marie Angelillo, a former nurse. The two married in 1979, and for the next 20 years they traveled around the world as Capellas climbed the ranks of each company he joined.
Business[edit]
Capellas began his career at Republic Steel. He went on to hold senior executive roles at Schlumberger, Benchmarking Partners, SAP, and Oracle Corporation. Capellas joined Compaq Computer Corporation as CIO in 1998. In 1999, when president and chief executive officer (CEO) Eckhard Pfeiffer was forced to resign after a boardroom coup led by chairman Benjamin M. Rosen, Rosen took on the capacity of interim CEO while Capellas was elevated to COO. Several months later, Capellas became permanent CEO and Chairman of Compaq.[1]
As chairman and CEO of Compaq between 1999 and 2001, Capellas helped repair the relationship between Microsoft and Compaq, which had eroded over the years. His efforts resulted in Compaq becoming Microsoft's key strategic partner for the release of its Windows 2000 operating system.
In 2001, Capellas led Compaq into an acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, but the deal was delayed for eight months because of a proxy and boardroom battle within HP. Finally, on May 3, 2002, Hewlett-Packard announced approval of the acquisition and Capellas became president of the post-merger Hewlett-Packard, under CEO Carly Fiorina, to ease the integration of the two companies. However, Capellas was reported not to be happy with his role, being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become CEO as the board supported Fiorina. Capellas stepped down on November 12, 2002, just six months on the job. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.[2][3]
In December 2002, Capellas became the turnaround president and CEO of WorldCom (later MCI). He led a successful restructuring of the organization, one of the largest in corporate history, and stepped down as CEO after MCI's merger with Verizon in 2006.[4][5]
In December 2006, Capellas was appointed acting CEO of Serena Software, selected by Silver Lake Partners, the company that took Serena private in March 2006 and where Capellas served as a senior advisor.
On July 10, 2007, Capellas was identified as the new CEO of First Data Corporation. The position was to become effective upon the completion of the leveraged buyout (LBO) of First Data by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
In 2010 it was announced he would be chairman and CEO of VCE, a joint venture of Cisco Systems and EMC Corporation with investment from Intel and VMware that specializes in cloud computing.[6] In July 2012 a new president and CEO of VCE replaced Capellas.[7]
Capellas is on the board of directors for Cisco,[8][9] and was on the national board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In 2001, Capellas was inducted into the Warren, Ohio Schools Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.[10]

Press Release




Cisco and EMC Appoint Michael D. Capellas to Lead VCE Coalition; Named CEO of Acadia Joint Venture
New Position Brings Top-Flight Leadership to Accelerate Transformation of the Data Center, Helping Organizations Reduce Costs, Improve Business Agility through Private Cloud Computing


Tweet







HOPKINTON, Mass., May 5, 2010 - 
Cisco and EMC today announced industry veteran Michael D. Capellas has joined the team to lead all aspects of the Virtual Computing Environment (VCE) coalition and has also been appointed to the complementary role of CEO of Acadia, a Cisco-EMC joint venture with investment from Intel and VMware. The VCE coalition with Acadia is focused on accelerating the transformation of the data center, helping organizations reduce costs and more quickly and securely deploy new business applications through private cloud computing. Cloud computing brings together the best elements of information management, next-generation networks, high-performance computing and systems management to redefine how information technology is deployed.  Private cloud is an enterprise-strength model designed to give organizations flexibility and more control and security over their computing environments. The VCE coalition was formed to bring together industry-leading IT infrastructure from three companies and deliver it to customers as a single entity.  In his role as the VCE coalition leader, Capellas, 55, will drive broad customer and partner adoption of the coalition’s business-ready IT solutions including Vblock packages.  In addition, Capellas will work to help ensure that customers benefit from the VCE coalition’s value of full accountability and will also attract additional partners to the coalition. Capellas will also lead Acadia’s unique “build, operate and transfer” business model designed to enable a broad set of partners to accelerate customer build-outs of private cloud infrastructures.  He will report to Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO, and John Chambers, Cisco Chairman and CEO, and the Acadia Board. Capellas has tremendous experience in executive and technology leadership roles.  Most recently, he was Chairman and CEO of First Data Corporation, a global leader in electronic commerce and payment processing.  Under the leadership of Capellas, the company drove innovation through new product development, including a joint partnership with EMC to deliver secure, encrypted payment card data.  Prior to First Data, Capellas served as MCI's president and CEO and oversaw its  successful rebuilding and transformation from a long distance carrier to the leading Internet Protocol networks company.  Capellas was President of HP after merging Compaq with HP. At Compaq, he started out as CIO, then COO and later became Chairman and CEO.  Prior to Compaq, he spent 20 years in technology positions for Oracle, SAP and Schlumberger.  He currently serves as a senior advisor to Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts (KKR) and First Data.  Capellas serves on the board of directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. and the national board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Joe Tucci, Chairman and CEO, EMC, said, “We are very fortunate to have someone of Michael Capellas’ stature lead VCE and take on the role of CEO for Acadia.  With more than three decades of experience, Michael has made a career out of leading and transforming large corporations.  Today, IT departments are undergoing their own transformation as they begin their journey to the private cloud to reduce their computing costs and have more flexibility in the way they deploy applications. I believe Michael is the perfect executive to build added confidence and trust in the power of Cisco, EMC and our partners to help them along the way.” John Chambers, Cisco Chairman and CEO, said, “Michael’s appointment to lead the VCE coalition and his role as CEO of Acadia underscores our long-term commitment to deliver a seamless engagement model for customers and partners to access the advanced technologies, support and services they have come to expect from Cisco and EMC. As we work together with VMware and other key partners to help our customers realize the potential of the private cloud, we couldn’t be more confident in the value of the VCE coalition with a leader of Michael’s distinction at the helm.” Michael Capellas said, “There's never been a better time to be in the heart of the industry helping customers take advantage of the next great wave of information technology innovation, the private cloud. The experience I’ve gained working and leading amazing companies will allow me to foster this truly unique opportunity.  With unmatched talent, financial resources and industry-leading technologies from three visionary companies, we can change the face of IT.   I’m extremely excited and fortunate to lead the VCE coalition and work with many of the best minds in the industry.” The appointment of Capellas by Cisco and EMC comes at a time when the VCE coalition is seeing strong market acceptance for Vblock, its pre-integrated, pre-tested technology packages for fully-virtualized data centers. VCE has already secured 45 partners and six system integrators that are currently selling Vblocks, and some 200 additional partners are in the certification phase.  The total market for private cloud infrastructure, including the element that can be addressed by the VCE coalition, is estimated to be $85B by 2015.

Michael D. Capellas was Chairman & CEO of First Data Corporation (FDC), the world’s leading payment processing company, from 2007 to 2010. He was on the board of directors of VCE, the Virtual Computing Environment Company, from January 2006 to November 2012, serving one year as Chairman and CEO. The company was formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel, offering technology products and solutions for cloud-based computing.
He is on the board of Cisco, a multinational corporation networking and communications technology and services company. Capellas was also senior advisor for Silver Lake Partners, a $13 billion private equity firm focused on making large-scale investments in leading technology companies, from October 2006 to July 2007.
Capellas’ earlier executive roles include chairman & CEO of Compaq Computer Corporation between 1999 and 2001. Following Hewlett-Packard’s acquisition of Compaq, he stayed on as president of HP for six months to ease the integration of the two companies. He then left HP to become chairman & CEO of MCI WorldCom between 2002 and 2006, presiding over the eventual Verizon-MCI merger. He had joined WorldCom, which was in bankruptcy, to help it overcome a massive accounting scandal. After the transfer to Verizon was completed, Capellas received a $40 million severance package.
A 30-year veteran of the IT industry, he took charge of First Data shortly after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired the credit card giant for $29 billion in April 2007. In 1992, First Data spun off from American Express. It handles e-commerce processing services, including merchant and bank transactions, credit, retail and debit card issuing and processing. Capellas left First Data in 2010
Capellas says he inherited his gritty determination from his father, a Greek citizen who fought with the Greek Army against the Germans in Italy during World War II. After the war, the elder Capellas met and married his wife Juliet in Italy. The family then immigrated to Ohio, where Capellas’ father worked his way up from laborer to superintendent at the Republic Steel Corporation. He worked there for 30 years. 
Capellas developed an interest in computers as an undergraduate at Kent State University. Shortly after he graduated, he met his wife, Marie Angelillo, a former nurse. The two married in 1979, and traveled the world for two decades as Capellas’ business reputation grew. 
He was a senior vice president of Oracle Corporation in 1997-98. He is credited, in his work with Compaq, with making it Microsoft’s key strategic partner for the release of its Windows 2000 operating system. In December 2006, Capellas was appointed acting CEO of Serena Software, selected by Silver Lake, which took Serena private in March 2006.
Capellas and his wife have two daughters. He is also actively involved in community and charitable work. In 2002, he became the first recipient of the Hope Technology Award from the Center for Missing & Exploited Children. He is a member of the Board of Governors of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Capellas previously served as a member of the American University Board of Trustees. He recently served as co-chair of the CLOUD² Commission, including specialists who offered the Obama government recommendations on cloud computing policies.

Cisco and EMC Appoint Michael D. Capellas to Lead VCE Coalition; Named CEO of Acadia Joint Venture
New Position Brings Top-Flight Leadership to Accelerate Transformation of the Data Center, Helping Organizations Reduce Costs, Improve Business Agility through Private Cloud Computing


Tweet







HOPKINTON, Mass., May 5, 2010 - 
Cisco and EMC today announced industry veteran Michael D. Capellas has joined the team to lead all aspects of the Virtual Computing Environment (VCE) coalition and has also been appointed to the complementary role of CEO of Acadia, a Cisco-EMC joint venture with investment from Intel and VMware. The VCE coalition with Acadia is focused on accelerating the transformation of the data center, helping organizations reduce costs and more quickly and securely deploy new business applications through private cloud computing. Cloud computing brings together the best elements of information management, next-generation networks, high-performance computing and systems management to redefine how information technology is deployed.  Private cloud is an enterprise-strength model designed to give organizations flexibility and more control and security over their computing environments. The VCE coalition was formed to bring together industry-leading IT infrastructure from three companies and deliver it to customers as a single entity.  In his role as the VCE coalition leader, Capellas, 55, will drive broad customer and partner adoption of the coalition’s business-ready IT solutions including Vblock packages.  In addition, Capellas will work to help ensure that customers benefit from the VCE coalition’s value of full accountability and will also attract additional partners to the coalition. Capellas will also lead Acadia’s unique “build, operate and transfer” business model designed to enable a broad set of partners to accelerate customer build-outs of private cloud infrastructures.  He will report to Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO, and John Chambers, Cisco Chairman and CEO, and the Acadia Board. Capellas has tremendous experience in executive and technology leadership roles.  Most recently, he was Chairman and CEO of First Data Corporation, a global leader in electronic commerce and payment processing.  Under the leadership of Capellas, the company drove innovation through new product development, including a joint partnership with EMC to deliver secure, encrypted payment card data.  Prior to First Data, Capellas served as MCI's president and CEO and oversaw its  successful rebuilding and transformation from a long distance carrier to the leading Internet Protocol networks company.  Capellas was President of HP after merging Compaq with HP. At Compaq, he started out as CIO, then COO and later became Chairman and CEO.  Prior to Compaq, he spent 20 years in technology positions for Oracle, SAP and Schlumberger.  He currently serves as a senior advisor to Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts (KKR) and First Data.  Capellas serves on the board of directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. and the national board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Joe Tucci, Chairman and CEO, EMC, said, “We are very fortunate to have someone of Michael Capellas’ stature lead VCE and take on the role of CEO for Acadia.  With more than three decades of experience, Michael has made a career out of leading and transforming large corporations.  Today, IT departments are undergoing their own transformation as they begin their journey to the private cloud to reduce their computing costs and have more flexibility in the way they deploy applications. I believe Michael is the perfect executive to build added confidence and trust in the power of Cisco, EMC and our partners to help them along the way.” John Chambers, Cisco Chairman and CEO, said, “Michael’s appointment to lead the VCE coalition and his role as CEO of Acadia underscores our long-term commitment to deliver a seamless engagement model for customers and partners to access the advanced technologies, support and services they have come to expect from Cisco and EMC. As we work together with VMware and other key partners to help our customers realize the potential of the private cloud, we couldn’t be more confident in the value of the VCE coalition with a leader of Michael’s distinction at the helm.” Michael Capellas said, “There's never been a better time to be in the heart of the industry helping customers take advantage of the next great wave of information technology innovation, the private cloud. The experience I’ve gained working and leading amazing companies will allow me to foster this truly unique opportunity.  With unmatched talent, financial resources and industry-leading technologies from three visionary companies, we can change the face of IT.   I’m extremely excited and fortunate to lead the VCE coalition and work with many of the best minds in the industry.” The appointment of Capellas by Cisco and EMC comes at a time when the VCE coalition is seeing strong market acceptance for Vblock, its pre-integrated, pre-tested technology packages for fully-virtualized data centers. VCE has already secured 45 partners and six system integrators that are currently selling Vblocks, and some 200 additional partners are in the certification phase.  The total market for private cloud infrastructure, including the element that can be addressed by the VCE coalition, is estimated to be $85B by 2015.

Michael D. Capellas


Career PathLight Reading12/10/2002Comment (5)Login50%50%

Michael D. Capellas has taken on what could be the role of a lifetime.

At 48 he has held more than two dozen jobs at eight companies, including Schlumberger Ltd., SAP America Inc., Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq: ORCL), Compaq, and, briefly, Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ). In mid-November he accepted the offer to become chairman and CEO of bankrupt carrier WorldCom Inc. (OTC: WCOEQ).
Capellas's resumé speaks volumes about his restless ambition. He was once quoted as saying, “I always wanted the toughest job." 

With that in mind, Capellas would be hard pressed to find a harder job than the one he has just taken on. Although WorldCom still hails as the nation's No. 2 long-distance communications company and one of the world's largest Internet carriers, it has been tainted by scandal and buried in bankruptcy.  And like the rest of the telecommunications market, it is struggling to stay alive. 
Although Capellas has not had any traditional telecom experience, he has gained a reputation as an astute manager. Most recently he served as president of Hewlett-Packard. And before that he was chairman and CEO of Compaq, where he helped broker the 2001 merger between Compaq and HP. He joined Compaq in 1998 as chief information officer and also served as chief operating officer before being named CEO in July 1999.  Prior to his Compaq days, Capellas held senior positions at SAP America and Oracle Corp. in areas ranging from application development to sales and general management. He also spent 16 years with Schlumberger, a global technology service provider, in management positions around the world.
Several industry observers say they think Capellas is a good choice for WorldCom.

 "A high-profile CEO certainly increases the odds of the company emerging from bankruptcy,” says John Hodulik, an analyst with UBS Warburg. “I would say this is a good sign for them." 

Unlike former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, whose aggressive acquisition strategy has received much of the blame for the accounting scandals surrounding the carrier, Capellas is viewed as a conservative, cautious strategist. He is credited with bringing stability, if not massive growth, to Compaq after he took over the company in 1999. 

 “Getting someone with a conservative approach might be the best move in the world right now,” says Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects. “He’d be a good one for the job." 

Capellas will certainly have his work cut out for him. The company has admitted that its earnings misstatements for the past couple of years total more than $9 billion, and most observers expect even more accounting problems to come out of the woodwork in coming months (see WorldCom Restatements Top $9B).

WorldCom says it plans to pay its new chairman and CEO a salary of $5 million for his first year on the job. This includes a $1.5 million base salary along with a $2 million signing bonus and other  potential performance bonuses worth $1.5 million, according to bankruptcy filings. Capellas will also get another $18 million in restricted stock in the newly reorganized WorldCom when it emerges from bankruptcy. The company expects to come out of bankruptcy in mid-2003.

The proposed WorldCom package would be a nice bump up from Capellas's former job. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Capellas’s annual salary for 2001 was $1.6 million, and he received $2.1 million in other compensation.  

As of last year, former WorldCom CEO Ebbers reportedly made $1 million in base salary. He recieved a $10 million bonus in 2000 and still owes the company more than $400 million in loans.

The compensation package still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court and pass the scrutiny of the court-appointed monitor, Richard Breeden. A hearing to review Capellas' pay package will be held on Dec. 16.

Capellas, who had his first official day on the job in early December, has chosen to work out of the company’s  Ashburn, Va., office instead of its headquarters in Clinton, Miss.

Why doesn't Capellas come down here to Jackson and clean up the mess? Did the fat comp package make him too haughty to get down here and live among us and clean up Bernie's mess?

re: Michael D. Capellas 
Dr. Capella may have moved from job-to-job in search of job titles and higher salaries. He never matured in any position. WorldCom does will not benefit a dime from Dr. Capellas. He has no idea about the competition and relevant technologies.This kind corruption will not take place anywhere in the world except in our country. There is no respect for merit, qualifications, and education.

The entire telcom sectorhas discredited itself.  All of the second-lineexecutives in the sector with the experienceyou think is so great have a cloud hanging overthem.  Every insider at worldcom is tainted.The same is true of almost every other telcomexec.Qwest stayed within the industry and put its hopes on the man who destroyed ameritech.From my point of view, capellas being a totaloutsider was the best choice for worldcom tomake.--------This kind corruption will not take place anywhere in the world except in our country. There is no respect for merit, qualifications, and education.--------UmmmmmMaybe you should check:Cable and Wireless (non-disclosure of critical          financial information) DT (in germany)     (total basket case financially)BT     And their recent hiring of the CFO who guided     williams into bankrupcy.

Michael David Capellas


Born
August 19, 1955 (1955-08-19) (age 61)


Alma mater
Kent State University


Occupation
Business executive
Board member of Cisco


Known for
Chairman and CEO of VCE
CEO of First Data Corporation
MCI CEO prior to Verizon acquisition
Compaq CEO prior to HP acquisition


Michael David Capellas (born August 19, 1955) is an American executive in the computer and telecommunication industries. Capellas served as chairman and CEO of First Data Corporation, acting CEO of Serena Software, chairman and CEO of Compaq Computer Corporation until its merger with Hewlett-Packard where he became president of the post-merger company briefly, and president and CEO of WorldCom (later MCI) where he led its merger with Verizon.

Early years[edit]
Capellas claims that he inherited a gritty determination from his father, a Greek citizen who fought with the Greek Army against the Germans in Italy in World War II.[citation needed] After the war, the elder Capellas met and married his wife, Juliet, in Italy. The family then emigrated to Ohio where Capellas' father worked his way up from laborer to superintendent at the Republic Steel Corp. My dad had an unbelievable work ethic. He was intensely loyal to the company. He worked there for 30 years, says Capellas.
As an undergraduate at Kent State University, Capellas developed an interest in computers. Shortly after he graduated with a BBA from Kent State, Capellas met his future wife, Marie Angelillo, a former nurse. The two married in 1979, and for the next 20 years they traveled around the world as Capellas climbed the ranks of each company he joined.
Business[edit]
Capellas began his career at Republic Steel. He went on to hold senior executive roles at Schlumberger, Benchmarking Partners, SAP, and Oracle Corporation. Capellas joined Compaq Computer Corporation as CIO in 1998. In 1999, when president and chief executive officer (CEO) Eckhard Pfeiffer was forced to resign after a boardroom coup led by chairman Benjamin M. Rosen, Rosen took on the capacity of interim CEO while Capellas was elevated to COO. Several months later, Capellas became permanent CEO and Chairman of Compaq.[1]
As chairman and CEO of Compaq between 1999 and 2001, Capellas helped repair the relationship between Microsoft and Compaq, which had eroded over the years. His efforts resulted in Compaq becoming Microsoft's key strategic partner for the release of its Windows 2000 operating system.
In 2001, Capellas led Compaq into an acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, but the deal was delayed for eight months because of a proxy and boardroom battle within HP. Finally, on May 3, 2002, Hewlett-Packard announced approval of the acquisition and Capellas became president of the post-merger Hewlett-Packard, under CEO Carly Fiorina, to ease the integration of the two companies. However, Capellas was reported not to be happy with his role, being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become CEO as the board supported Fiorina. Capellas stepped down on November 12, 2002, just six months on the job. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.[2][3]
In December 2002, Capellas became the turnaround president and CEO of WorldCom (later MCI). He led a successful restructuring of the organization, one of the largest in corporate history, and stepped down as CEO after MCI's merger with Verizon in 2006.[4][5]
In December 2006, Capellas was appointed acting CEO of Serena Software, selected by Silver Lake Partners, the company that took Serena private in March 2006 and where Capellas served as a senior advisor.
On July 10, 2007, Capellas was identified as the new CEO of First Data Corporation. The position was to become effective upon the completion of the leveraged buyout (LBO) of First Data by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
In 2010 it was announced he would be chairman and CEO of VCE, a joint venture of Cisco Systems and EMC Corporation with investment from Intel and VMware that specializes in cloud computing.[6] In July 2012 a new president and CEO of VCE replaced Capellas.[7]
Capellas is on the board of directors for Cisco,[8][9] and was on the national board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In 2001, Capellas was inducted into the Warren, Ohio Schools Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.[10]

Early years[edit]
Capellas claims that he inherited a gritty determination from his father, a Greek citizen who fought with the Greek Army against the Germans in Italy in World War II.[citation needed] After the war, the elder Capellas met and married his wife, Juliet, in Italy. The family then emigrated to Ohio where Capellas' father worked his way up from laborer to superintendent at the Republic Steel Corp. My dad had an unbelievable work ethic. He was intensely loyal to the company. He worked there for 30 years, says Capellas.
As an undergraduate at Kent State University, Capellas developed an interest in computers. Shortly after he graduated with a BBA from Kent State, Capellas met his future wife, Marie Angelillo, a former nurse. The two married in 1979, and for the next 20 years they traveled around the world as Capellas climbed the ranks of each company he joined.
Business[edit]
Capellas began his career at Republic Steel. He went on to hold senior executive roles at Schlumberger, Benchmarking Partners, SAP, and Oracle Corporation. Capellas joined Compaq Computer Corporation as CIO in 1998. In 1999, when president and chief executive officer (CEO) Eckhard Pfeiffer was forced to resign after a boardroom coup led by chairman Benjamin M. Rosen, Rosen took on the capacity of interim CEO while Capellas was elevated to COO. Several months later, Capellas became permanent CEO and Chairman of Compaq.[1]
As chairman and CEO of Compaq between 1999 and 2001, Capellas helped repair the relationship between Microsoft and Compaq, which had eroded over the years. His efforts resulted in Compaq becoming Microsoft's key strategic partner for the release of its Windows 2000 operating system.
In 2001, Capellas led Compaq into an acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, but the deal was delayed for eight months because of a proxy and boardroom battle within HP. Finally, on May 3, 2002, Hewlett-Packard announced approval of the acquisition and Capellas became president of the post-merger Hewlett-Packard, under CEO Carly Fiorina, to ease the integration of the two companies. However, Capellas was reported not to be happy with his role, being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become CEO as the board supported Fiorina. Capellas stepped down on November 12, 2002, just six months on the job. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.[2][3]
In December 2002, Capellas became the turnaround president and CEO of WorldCom (later MCI). He led a successful restructuring of the organization, one of the largest in corporate history, and stepped down as CEO after MCI's merger with Verizon in 2006.[4][5]
In December 2006, Capellas was appointed acting CEO of Serena Software, selected by Silver Lake Partners, the company that took Serena private in March 2006 and where Capellas served as a senior advisor.
On July 10, 2007, Capellas was identified as the new CEO of First Data Corporation. The position was to become effective upon the completion of the leveraged buyout (LBO) of First Data by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
In 2010 it was announced he would be chairman and CEO of VCE, a joint venture of Cisco Systems and EMC Corporation with investment from Intel and VMware that specializes in cloud computing.[6] In July 2012 a new president and CEO of VCE replaced Capellas.[7]
Capellas is on the board of directors for Cisco,[8][9] and was on the national board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In 2001, Capellas was inducted into the Warren, Ohio Schools Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.[10]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
