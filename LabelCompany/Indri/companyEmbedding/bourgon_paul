Kentucky Woods Bourbon Barrel Cake | Paul's Fruit


































 


















 









Kentucky Woods Bourbon Barrel Cake
Bourbon has proudly been produced in Kentucky using charred oak barrels since the 18th century, and two hundred years of tradition are in every Kentucky Woods Bourbon Barrel Cake.A Kentucky Woods Bourbon Barrel Cake starts off with a brown sugar cake that is blended with a chocolate cake that has been made with 3 kinds of aged Kentucky bourbon. It is topped with Walnuts and then baked, cooled and soaked in a secret process to bring out the essence of the cake and make it into a unique, moist, and decadently rich dessert.It is finally topped with a chocolate and maple caramel drizzle before it is packed into a handmade wood barrel cake box.Anyone of any age can eat a slice of Kentucky Woods Barrel Cake, too: even though each cake is made with bourbon, it cooks out during the baking leaving less than .5% alcohol as a result. The cake retains its rich bourbon taste through a unique recipe that preserves the essence of the bourbon flavor without any alcohol.This cake weighs a full 50oz. (more than 3 pounds!) and measures appx. 10" across. You should easily be able to get 12 slices per cake, and even more than that if you cut brownie-style square pieces.Note: Adam Matthews is the only company who makes the Kentucky Woods Bourbon Barrel cake. They follow a family recipe and tradition known only to a few select people and master bakers.
