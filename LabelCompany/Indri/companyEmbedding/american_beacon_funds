American Beacon Home : Other Products : Alternative Investment Funds

Alternative Investment Funds
We bring years of experience as a private equity investor.  This  alternative form of investing offers institutions ownership in a company with  equity securities not publicly available.
The term “private equity” is generally used to describe  investments in companies through private transactions in return for ownership  interests in those companies. While those companies may have some publicly  traded securities, private equity investors generally purchase non-publicly  traded securities.
Private equity investing benefits companies and individuals  by providing an additional or an alternative source of capital to the public  equity and debt markets. This capital may be used for a number of different  purposes, including financing product development or additional manufacturing  capacity, funding a joint venture, restructuring a company's operations or  balance sheet, or financing acquisitions.
American Private Equity Management (APEM) manages more than $230 million in a family of private equity funds of funds. The APEM platform consists of a series of three funds of funds vehicles that invest capital primarily in the middle market leveraged buyout space, with added exposure to other strategies (i.e., oil & gas and distressed debt). APEM engages American Beacon Advisors, Inc., a registered investment adviser, to provide management and administrative services to the funds of funds, and to source, evaluate, select and monitor underlying private equity funds.    
Please contact Mac Owens at 1.800.967.9009 x6224 to learn more about these investment opportunities.

Performance shown is historical and is not indicative of future returns. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance shown is as of date indicated, and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. To obtain performance as of the most recent month end,  please call 800-967-9009 or visit www.americanbeaconfunds.com.

* Not Annualized 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUNDS: 
Credit Risk (applies to  Balanced and High Yield Bond Funds): Credit risk is the risk that the issuer of  a bond will fail to make timely payment of interest or principal; and the  decline in an issuer's credit rating can cause the price of its bonds to go  down.
Interest Rate Risk (applies to  Balanced and High Yield Bond Funds): Investing in fixed-income securities  entails interest rate risk, which is the risk that fixed-income securities will  decrease in value with increases in market interest rates.
 Emerging Markets  Risk (applies to Emerging Markets Fund): The risks of investing in foreign equities  are heightened when investing in emerging markets.
 Foreign Securities  Risk (applies to Balanced, Emerging Markets, High Yield Bond, International Equity,  Large Cap Value, Mid-Cap Value and Small Cap Value Funds): Investing in foreign  securities entails additional risk not associated with domestic securities,  such as currency fluctuations, economic and political instability and  differences in accounting standards.
Futures Risk (applies to  Balanced, Emerging Markets, International Equity, Large Cap Value, Mid-Cap  Value and Small Cap Value Funds): The Fund may invest in futures contracts,  which are a type of derivative investment. Investing in derivatives could  result in losing more than the amount invested.
 High Yield Risk (applies to the  High Yield Bond Fund): Investing in high yield securities involves additional  risks when compared to investing in investment-grade securities. These include  a greater risk of default or bankruptcy and an increased sensitivity to  financial difficulties or changes in interest rates.
 Securities Lending  Risk (applies to International Equity and Small Cap Value Funds): The Fund may  participate in a securities lending program.
 Small and  Mid-Capitalization Risk (applies to Balanced, High Yield Bond, Mid-Cap Value and Small Cap Value Funds):  The Fund invests in small and/or mid-sized companies, which involves additional  risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
 Value Risk (applies to Balanced,  International Equity, Large Cap Value, Mid-Cap Value and Small Cap Value  Funds): The intrinsic value of stocks selected for the Fund may never be  realized by the market, and the prices of value stocks may go down. While  investing in value stocks may limit downside risk over time, the Fund may  produce more modest gains than riskier stock funds as a trade-off for this  potentially lower risk.
Please  see the prospectus for a complete discussion of the Fund’s risks. There can be  no assurances that the investment objectives of the Fund(s) will be met.
For any Class of the Fund  that began operating within the 10-year/since inception period shown, the  performance shown prior to the inception date of the Class is that of a class  (or series of classes) previously in operation. The combined returns have not  been adjusted for any difference between the fees and expenses of the Class and  the historical fees and expenses of the included previous class (or classes).  If the previous class(es) had lower expenses, the resulting performance would  be better than the Class would have realized during the same period. If the  previous class(es) had higher expenses, the resulting performance would be  lower than the Class would have realized during the same period. Specific information  about any Fund may be found at americanbeaconfunds.com or in the prospectus.

American Beacon Broadens Alternatives Product Line With American Beacon Grosvenor Long/Short Fund
New Fund Complements Traditional Long-Only Equity Investments



















October 01, 2015 10:22 ET

 | Source: American Beacon Advisors





IRVING, Texas, Oct. 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - American Beacon Advisors, Inc. ("American Beacon"), an experienced provider of investment advisory services to institutional and retail markets, launched the American Beacon Grosvenor Long/Short Fund (Institutional Class: GVRIX, A Class: GSVAX) today.

	The American Beacon Grosvenor Long/Short Fund employs a multi-manager structure. The Fund's primary portfolio manager is Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("GCM Grosvenor"), a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services for alternative investment programs. GCM Grosvenor used its global reach, extensive relationships, and thorough due-diligence process to select the Fund's additional sub-advisors, who are each experienced and successful long/short equity investors.

	"Providing our clients access to alternative sources of diversification has been a focus for American Beacon as we've looked to evolve our product line, and our collaboration with GCM Grosvenor, one of the world's most experienced and well respected hedge fund investors, on this new fund is another example of that strategy at work," Gene L. Needles, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of American Beacon said. "For financial professionals and clients who are looking to add alternatives to their portfolios, the American Beacon Grosvenor Long/Short Fund will offer the potential to increase performance consistency and lower volatility through its flexible mandate."

	"For 45 years, GCM Grosvenor has set the standard as one of the world's largest and most diversified allocators to alternative investments, and we are very pleased to bring that capability to investors focused on mutual funds through this partnership with American Beacon," said Michael Sacks, Chairman and CEO of GCM Grosvenor. "Our specialized investment team is among the largest and most experienced in the industry, and this fund's underlying hedge fund managers have strong capabilities in long/short investing. This is a tremendous opportunity to deliver an exciting investment solution to the marketplace."

	The American Beacon Grosvenor Long/Short Fund is the third alternatives product launched by the company since August 2014. The other alternatives products include the American Beacon AHL Managed Futures Strategy Fund and the American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund.

	About American Beacon Advisors

	Established in 1986, American Beacon is an experienced provider of investment advisory services to institutional and retail markets. American Beacon Advisors serves defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, corporations and other institutional investors, as well as retail clients. The firm also provides corporate cash management and fixed-income separate account management.

	American Beacon manages the American Beacon Funds, a series of competitively priced mutual funds. The Funds employ a "manager of managers" investment style and currently include international and domestic equity, fixed-income and money market funds. As of June 30, 2015, American Beacon Advisors had $61.6 billion in assets under management. For more information, go to http://www.americanbeaconfunds.com or follow on Twitter via @AmBeacon.

	About GCM Grosvenor

	GCM Grosvenor, headquartered in Chicago, Ill., is one of the world's largest and most diversified independent alternative asset management firms. The firm has been managing alternative investment portfolios on behalf of its clients since 1971. As of June 30, 2015, GCM Grosvenor manages approximately $51.1 billion in assets. Of that amount, more than $27 billion is invested with hedge fund managers, which enables the firm to negotiate favorable portfolio structures and reduced management fees.

	You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus, please contact your financial advisor, call (800) 967-9009 or visit americanbeaconfunds.com. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

	Important Information: All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's strategy of investing in a variety of long/short strategies entails certain risks including that the lead sub-advisor's judgments about allocation between such strategies, as well as the selection of the sub-advisors and their subsequent individual investment decisions, may not perform to expectations resulting in the Fund's underperformance or even losses versus other similar funds. Because the Fund may invest in fewer issuers than a more diversified portfolio, the fluctuating value of a single holding may have a greater effect on the value of the Fund. The Fund may have high portfolio turnover risk, which could increase the Fund's transaction costs and possibly have a negative impact on performance. Investing in small- or medium-capitalization stocks may involve greater volatility and lower liquidity than larger company stocks. Investing in foreign securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political risks. Investing in derivative instruments involves liquidity, credit, interest rate and market risks and in some cases the addition of financial leverage which can magnify these risks. Short sales involve special risks, including greater reliance on the sub-advisor's ability to accurately anticipate the future value of a security or instrument; the Fund's losses are potentially unlimited in a short sale.

	Please see the prospectus for a complete discussion of the Fund's risks. There can be no assurances that the investment objectives of this Fund will be met.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1091 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns

This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks current income, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation.




Strategy



Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) are invested in equity and equity-related investments. It may also invest up to 20% of its net assets in fixed income instruments, primarily including trust preferred securities. The fund may invest in issuers of any market capitalization and will typically hold 30 to 40 issuers.


Risk



Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

� 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Performance
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a CDSC.
Class V: POP returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at NAV. Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.

Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).

Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges or redemption fees, but do not include 12b-1 fees and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Rankings for each share class will vary due to different expenses. Had sales charges or redemption fees been included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.

Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund's most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund's NAV.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.

Performance
Returns shown do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, or imposed on Accounts that may own shares directly. Inclusion of these charges would reduce total returns for all periods shown.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year. 
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund’s share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.

The Columbia Variable Portfolios and Wanger Funds (the "Variable Funds") are available only through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by participating insurance companies or certain eligible retirement plans. The Variable Funds are not offered to the public. Not all Variable Funds and classes are available in all contracts, policies or plans. Please contact your financial advisor or insurance representative for more information.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Columbia Variable Portfolios. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Wanger Funds. The variable funds are distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., member FINRA.


Performance
Effective 09/01/2016, performance reporting for Class A and Class AG with all sales charges reflects a maximum sales charge of 3.75% , except for the Columbia Conservative 529 Portfolio, FA Strategic Income 529 Portfolio, Columbia Income Opportunities 529 Portfolio, Columbia Total Return Bond 529 Portfolio, JP Morgan Core Bond 529 Portfolio, iShares TIPS Bond ETF 529 Portfolio, Templeton Global Bond 529 Portfolio and Columbia US Government Mortgage 529 Portfolio, which reflect a maximum sales charge of 3%. The Columbia College 529 Portfolio, Columbia Short Term Bond 529 Portfolio, Columbia Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio have no initial sales charges for Pricing Alternative A, but the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio has a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for Pricing Alternative C.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor or visit columbiathreadneedle.com/us for a Program Description, which contains this and other important information about the Future Scholar College Savings Plan. Read it carefully before investing. You should also consider, before investing, whether the investor’s or designated beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state’s qualified tuition program.
Expense ratios are as of the plan's most recent Program Brochure & Tuition Savings Agreement. Performance may reflect waivers or reimbursements of fund expenses by the adviser or its affiliates. Absent these waivers, or reimbursement arrangements, performance results may be lower. The net and gross expense ratios shown are updated on the first day of each month.
Total returns assume the reinvestment of all underlying fund distributions at NAV. Portfolio unit value (PUV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSCs). If they were included, returns would have been lower.
Pricing Alternative B: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the applicable CDSC for the holding period after an initial purchase as follows: through the first year, 5%; second year, 4%; third year, 3%; fourth year, 3%; fifth year, 2%; sixth year, 1% and thereafter, 0%. These shares convert to Pricing Alternative A units in the eighth year after purchase. Effective December 1, 2010, Class B of each portfolio was closed to both new accounts and additional contributions to existing accounts.
Pricing Alternative C: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of a 1% CDSC for the first year after purchase except for the Conservative 529 and College 529 Portfolios as well as the single-fund fixed-income portfolios and the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio, which have a 0.75% CDSC.
Pricing Alternative E: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Pricing Alternative Z: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Contributions initially invested directly into the Columbia Bank Deposit 529 Portfolio are not subject to the imposition of an initial or deferred sales charge under any Pricing Alternative.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
