(OTCQB: ALMG), the parent company of BANK'34, today announced that it has completed its merger with Bank 1440.  Shareholders of Bank 1440 are entitled to receive $0.94 in cash and 0.17064 shares of Alamogordo Financial Corp. common stock for each share of Bank 1440 common stock that they owned as of the close of business on August 29, 2014.  Cash will also be paid in lieu of fractional shares at a rate of $16.00 per whole share of Alamogordo Financial Corp. common stock (the average closing price of Alamogordo Financial Corp. common stock for the 10 business days preceding August 26, 2014).  Bank 1440 stockholders will be receiving letters of transmittal from Computershare, who is Alamogordo Financial Corp.'s transfer agent, providing instructions for how to submit their stock certificates for the cash and shares of Alamogordo Financial Corp. common stock, and also providing instructions for a shareholder who has lost his or her Bank 1440 stock certificates.

Brian Ruisinger, Chief Executive Officer of Bank 1440, added, "The synergies created by this unique combination are compelling for all stakeholders. Throughout the process, we continually reminded ourselves to think differently from traditional banking norms to create a platform poised for growth and continued stability following 80 years of operations of the BANK'34 franchise."
