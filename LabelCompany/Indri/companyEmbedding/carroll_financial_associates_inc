Our Approach
Carroll Financial Associates, Inc. is one of the Charlotte region’s oldest and largest financial planning and wealth management firms. The firm was established in 1980 by Larry Carroll with the simple approach: "The best interest of the client is the only interest that matters."
Our mission is to assist you in reaching your financial goals by providing creative, intelligent solutions and quality financial services. We believe that you should be treated fairly, ethically, and respectfully and receive competent, courteous service and advice at a fair price.
Every advisor should act in his or her client’s best interest. At Carroll Financial we uphold the Fiduciary Standards required of a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our firm has acted as a fiduciary to our clients since it was founded in 1980 and all of our financial advisors are held to the fiduciary standard.

Our Eight C’s 

Our philosophy is simple: Trust Matters. You will see those words repeated throughout our communications; they act as a constant reminder that the most fundamental part of our job is building trust in our relationships.
How do we earn the trust of our clients?  Our logo is composed of eight interlocking C's.  These C's represent the ways we strive to earn our clients trust.

Clients – We believe that the best interest of our clients is the only interest that matters, and that means putting our clients first – always.
Commitment – We are committed to providing our clients with exceptional service, communication and financial advice.
Consistency – Consistency and dependability means we must follow through and do what we say we will do – every time.
Customization – Each relationship is unique, and our goal is to know our clients well so we can customize solutions for their specific situation.
Communication – We understand the importance of clear and frequent communication. While our clients may not care to know the details behind every financial decision, helping them understand our approach and thought process is an important aspect of the relationship.
Character – Character and integrity are fundamental qualities that must show through in everything we do inside or outside of the office.
Common Sense – We don’t believe that there are any tricks or magic solutions in financial planning. Rather, the best answers are often the simplest and should always pass the “common sense” test.
Community – Having served Carolina clients for over 30 years, we are grounded in the Charlotte area. As good corporate citizens, we are dedicated to improving our community through numerous charitable endeavors.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/30/1993
            

                BBB has determined that Carroll Financial Associates, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Our Approach
Carroll Financial Associates, Inc. is one of the Charlotte region’s oldest and largest financial planning and wealth management firms. The firm was established in 1980 by Larry Carroll with the simple approach: "The best interest of the client is the only interest that matters."
Our mission is to assist you in reaching your financial goals by providing creative, intelligent solutions and quality financial services. We believe that you should be treated fairly, ethically, and respectfully and receive competent, courteous service and advice at a fair price.
Every advisor should act in his or her client’s best interest. At Carroll Financial we uphold the Fiduciary Standards required of a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our firm has acted as a fiduciary to our clients since it was founded in 1980 and all of our financial advisors are held to the fiduciary standard.
