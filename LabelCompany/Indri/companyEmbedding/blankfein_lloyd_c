 In the discussion moderated by Edith Cooper, global head of Human Capital Management, Lloyd highlighted the importance of teamwork in the firm’s culture: "You can't do everything. You have to pick what you want to do, and what you want other people to do. To be effective, galvanize a team and make everybody on the team better."
 He also discussed his more than thirty years at the firm, growing up in Brooklyn and on Wall Street and the advice he'd give to his younger self.

Early life[edit]
Lloyd Blankfein was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, to a Jewish family, and reared in the Linden Houses, a New York City Housing Authority project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.[2][3] His father, Seymour Blankfein,[4] was a clerk with the U.S. Postal Service branch in the Manhattan borough of New York City and his mother was a receptionist.[5][6] As a boy, he worked as a concession vendor at Yankee Stadium.[6] He received primary and secondary education in the public schools of the New York City Department of Education, and was the valedictorian at Thomas Jefferson High School in 1971. He attended Harvard College, where he lived in Winthrop House, majored in History[7][8] and earned his A.B. in 1975.[6][9] In 1978, Blankfein received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.[6][9]
Career[edit]
Before working at Goldman Sachs, Blankfein worked for Proskauer Rose[10] and then Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine. In 1982, he joined the commodities trading firm J. Aron & Co., which was later acquired by Goldman, as a precious metals salesman in its London office. Blankfein managed or co-managed the Goldman Sachs Currency and Commodities Division from 1994 to 1997.[11] He served as vice chairman from April 2002 until January 2004, and was in charge of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) and Equities Division.[11]
Blankfein has served as chairman and chief executive officer since 2006. He earned a total of $54.4 million in 2006 as one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street. His bonus reflected the performance of Goldman Sachs, which reported record net earnings of $9.5 billion. The compensation included a cash bonus of $27.3 million, with the rest paid in stock and options. While CEO of Goldman Sachs Group in 2007, Blankfein earned a total compensation of $53,965,418, which included a base salary of $600,000, a cash bonus of $26,985,474, stocks granted of $15,542,756 and options granted of $10,453,031.[12] He received US$23 million in salary and bonuses in 2015, which was slightly down from the US$24 million he earned in 2014 from Goldman Sachs.[13][14]
In 2009, the Financial Times named Blankfein its "2009 Person of the Year", stating, "His bank has stuck to its strengths, unashamedly taken advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits."[4][15]
On January 13, 2010, Blankfein testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that he considered Goldman Sachs's role as primarily a market maker, not a creator of the product (i.e., subprime mortgage-related securities).[16] Blankfein testified before Congress in April 2010 at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He said that Goldman Sachs had no moral or legal obligation to inform its clients it was betting against the products which they were buying from Goldman Sachs because it was not acting in a fiduciary role.[17] The company was sued on April 16, 2010, by the SEC for the fraudulent selling of a synthetic CDO tied to subprime mortgages.[18] With Blankfein at the helm, Goldman has also been criticized "by lawmakers and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in helping Greece mask the size of its debts".[18]
In April 2011, a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Senator Carl Levin alleged that Blankfein misled Congress, though no perjury charges have been brought against Blankfein.[19][20][21] In August of the same year, Goldman confirmed that Blankfein had hired high-profile defense lawyer Reid Weingarten,[22] who had previously represented executives including former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey.[23] Two months later, in November 2011, Blankfein was listed as #43 on Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People.
In March 2012, a former Goldman executive, Greg Smith, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled "Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs", in which he heavily criticized the firm's top leadership and Blankfein in particular."[24] Smith's op-ed was criticized by many, particularly because he worked at Goldman for 12 years before deciding to quit due to moral objections.[24]
Politics[edit]
With regard to his personal political views, Blankfein has described himself as "a registered Democrat, and a Rockefeller Republican ... conservative on fiscal issues and more liberal on social issues".[25] Blankfein contributes to mostly Democratic party candidates and donated $4,600 to Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in 2007.[26] He is a supporter of gay marriage and has been a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.[27] In May 2012, Blankfein stated that his stance led Goldman Sachs to lose some clients.[28] Blankfein has visited the White House 14 times as of January 2013.[29] In 2015, he contributed to the Senate re-election campaigns for the Republicans Rob Portman and Roy Blunt. After 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in January 2016 named Blankfein as an example of corporate greed, Blankfein responded that Sanders' campaign had "the potential to be a dangerous moment."[30]
On April 7, 2009, he recommended guidelines to overhaul executive compensation. According to The New York Times, he said that lessons from the global financial crisis included the need to "apply basic standards to how we compensate people in our industry".[31] In November 2009, he declared in an interview, as a banker: "I'm doing God's work."[32] Several days later he indicated that he regretted that remark and said he had intended it as a joke. He also apologized on behalf of Goldman Sachs to the public for unspecified "things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret" and which contributed to the financial and economic crisis. The firm announced a 10,000 small businesses initiative, committing $500 million to aid American small businesses.[33]
On July 18, 2012, he commented about the effect of the Libor scandal on the financial system, "There was this huge hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it's just that much deeper." [34] The same day he met Jack Lew, President Barack Obama's chief of staff, and over lunch at the Economic Club of Washington was asked whether he had any aspiration to go into government like predecessors Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. "I have aspirations to be desired," he replied.[35]
On June 1, 2017, Blankfein posted his first ever tweet, despite joining the social media service in 2011. He condemned President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Accord, saying "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement".
Philanthropy[edit]
Blankfein formerly served on the board of trustees of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization, whose goal is to alleviate poverty in New York.[36] He serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for New York City,[37] and on the board of overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College.[38][39]
Personal life[edit]
Blankfein is married to Laura Jacobs, an attorney and the daughter of Norman S. Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of the Foreign Policy Association publications.[5] The couple have two sons, Alexander and Jonathan, and a daughter, Rachel.[6][40][41] On September 22, 2015, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying Blankfein had been diagnosed with a highly treatable form of lymphoma.[42] He received a treatment of chemotherapy.[43] By October 2016, he explained he was cured.[44]
Blankfein and his wife reside primarily in Manhattan's Upper West Side, but they also maintain a home in Bridgehampton, New York, as well as another house, set on 2.65 acres, in Sagaponack, New York.[6]

Early life[edit]
Lloyd Blankfein was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, to a Jewish family, and reared in the Linden Houses, a New York City Housing Authority project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.[2][3] His father, Seymour Blankfein,[4] was a clerk with the U.S. Postal Service branch in the Manhattan borough of New York City and his mother was a receptionist.[5][6] As a boy, he worked as a concession vendor at Yankee Stadium.[6] He received primary and secondary education in the public schools of the New York City Department of Education, and was the valedictorian at Thomas Jefferson High School in 1971. He attended Harvard College, where he lived in Winthrop House, majored in History[7][8] and earned his A.B. in 1975.[6][9] In 1978, Blankfein received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.[6][9]
Career[edit]
Before working at Goldman Sachs, Blankfein worked for Proskauer Rose[10] and then Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine. In 1982, he joined the commodities trading firm J. Aron & Co., which was later acquired by Goldman, as a precious metals salesman in its London office. Blankfein managed or co-managed the Goldman Sachs Currency and Commodities Division from 1994 to 1997.[11] He served as vice chairman from April 2002 until January 2004, and was in charge of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) and Equities Division.[11]
Blankfein has served as chairman and chief executive officer since 2006. He earned a total of $54.4 million in 2006 as one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street. His bonus reflected the performance of Goldman Sachs, which reported record net earnings of $9.5 billion. The compensation included a cash bonus of $27.3 million, with the rest paid in stock and options. While CEO of Goldman Sachs Group in 2007, Blankfein earned a total compensation of $53,965,418, which included a base salary of $600,000, a cash bonus of $26,985,474, stocks granted of $15,542,756 and options granted of $10,453,031.[12] He received US$23 million in salary and bonuses in 2015, which was slightly down from the US$24 million he earned in 2014 from Goldman Sachs.[13][14]
In 2009, the Financial Times named Blankfein its "2009 Person of the Year", stating, "His bank has stuck to its strengths, unashamedly taken advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits."[4][15]
On January 13, 2010, Blankfein testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that he considered Goldman Sachs's role as primarily a market maker, not a creator of the product (i.e., subprime mortgage-related securities).[16] Blankfein testified before Congress in April 2010 at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He said that Goldman Sachs had no moral or legal obligation to inform its clients it was betting against the products which they were buying from Goldman Sachs because it was not acting in a fiduciary role.[17] The company was sued on April 16, 2010, by the SEC for the fraudulent selling of a synthetic CDO tied to subprime mortgages.[18] With Blankfein at the helm, Goldman has also been criticized "by lawmakers and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in helping Greece mask the size of its debts".[18]
In April 2011, a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Senator Carl Levin alleged that Blankfein misled Congress, though no perjury charges have been brought against Blankfein.[19][20][21] In August of the same year, Goldman confirmed that Blankfein had hired high-profile defense lawyer Reid Weingarten,[22] who had previously represented executives including former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey.[23] Two months later, in November 2011, Blankfein was listed as #43 on Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People.
In March 2012, a former Goldman executive, Greg Smith, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled "Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs", in which he heavily criticized the firm's top leadership and Blankfein in particular."[24] Smith's op-ed was criticized by many, particularly because he worked at Goldman for 12 years before deciding to quit due to moral objections.[24]
Politics[edit]
With regard to his personal political views, Blankfein has described himself as "a registered Democrat, and a Rockefeller Republican ... conservative on fiscal issues and more liberal on social issues".[25] Blankfein contributes to mostly Democratic party candidates and donated $4,600 to Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in 2007.[26] He is a supporter of gay marriage and has been a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.[27] In May 2012, Blankfein stated that his stance led Goldman Sachs to lose some clients.[28] Blankfein has visited the White House 14 times as of January 2013.[29] In 2015, he contributed to the Senate re-election campaigns for the Republicans Rob Portman and Roy Blunt. After 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in January 2016 named Blankfein as an example of corporate greed, Blankfein responded that Sanders' campaign had "the potential to be a dangerous moment."[30]
On April 7, 2009, he recommended guidelines to overhaul executive compensation. According to The New York Times, he said that lessons from the global financial crisis included the need to "apply basic standards to how we compensate people in our industry".[31] In November 2009, he declared in an interview, as a banker: "I'm doing God's work."[32] Several days later he indicated that he regretted that remark and said he had intended it as a joke. He also apologized on behalf of Goldman Sachs to the public for unspecified "things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret" and which contributed to the financial and economic crisis. The firm announced a 10,000 small businesses initiative, committing $500 million to aid American small businesses.[33]
On July 18, 2012, he commented about the effect of the Libor scandal on the financial system, "There was this huge hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it's just that much deeper." [34] The same day he met Jack Lew, President Barack Obama's chief of staff, and over lunch at the Economic Club of Washington was asked whether he had any aspiration to go into government like predecessors Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. "I have aspirations to be desired," he replied.[35]
On June 1, 2017, Blankfein posted his first ever tweet, despite joining the social media service in 2011. He condemned President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Accord, saying "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement".
Philanthropy[edit]
Blankfein formerly served on the board of trustees of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization, whose goal is to alleviate poverty in New York.[36] He serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for New York City,[37] and on the board of overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College.[38][39]
Personal life[edit]
Blankfein is married to Laura Jacobs, an attorney and the daughter of Norman S. Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of the Foreign Policy Association publications.[5] The couple have two sons, Alexander and Jonathan, and a daughter, Rachel.[6][40][41] On September 22, 2015, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying Blankfein had been diagnosed with a highly treatable form of lymphoma.[42] He received a treatment of chemotherapy.[43] By October 2016, he explained he was cured.[44]
Blankfein and his wife reside primarily in Manhattan's Upper West Side, but they also maintain a home in Bridgehampton, New York, as well as another house, set on 2.65 acres, in Sagaponack, New York.[6]

Early life[edit]
Lloyd Blankfein was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, to a Jewish family, and reared in the Linden Houses, a New York City Housing Authority project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.[2][3] His father, Seymour Blankfein,[4] was a clerk with the U.S. Postal Service branch in the Manhattan borough of New York City and his mother was a receptionist.[5][6] As a boy, he worked as a concession vendor at Yankee Stadium.[6] He received primary and secondary education in the public schools of the New York City Department of Education, and was the valedictorian at Thomas Jefferson High School in 1971. He attended Harvard College, where he lived in Winthrop House, majored in History[7][8] and earned his A.B. in 1975.[6][9] In 1978, Blankfein received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.[6][9]
Career[edit]
Before working at Goldman Sachs, Blankfein worked for Proskauer Rose[10] and then Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine. In 1982, he joined the commodities trading firm J. Aron & Co., which was later acquired by Goldman, as a precious metals salesman in its London office. Blankfein managed or co-managed the Goldman Sachs Currency and Commodities Division from 1994 to 1997.[11] He served as vice chairman from April 2002 until January 2004, and was in charge of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) and Equities Division.[11]
Blankfein has served as chairman and chief executive officer since 2006. He earned a total of $54.4 million in 2006 as one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street. His bonus reflected the performance of Goldman Sachs, which reported record net earnings of $9.5 billion. The compensation included a cash bonus of $27.3 million, with the rest paid in stock and options. While CEO of Goldman Sachs Group in 2007, Blankfein earned a total compensation of $53,965,418, which included a base salary of $600,000, a cash bonus of $26,985,474, stocks granted of $15,542,756 and options granted of $10,453,031.[12] He received US$23 million in salary and bonuses in 2015, which was slightly down from the US$24 million he earned in 2014 from Goldman Sachs.[13][14]
In 2009, the Financial Times named Blankfein its "2009 Person of the Year", stating, "His bank has stuck to its strengths, unashamedly taken advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits."[4][15]
On January 13, 2010, Blankfein testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that he considered Goldman Sachs's role as primarily a market maker, not a creator of the product (i.e., subprime mortgage-related securities).[16] Blankfein testified before Congress in April 2010 at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He said that Goldman Sachs had no moral or legal obligation to inform its clients it was betting against the products which they were buying from Goldman Sachs because it was not acting in a fiduciary role.[17] The company was sued on April 16, 2010, by the SEC for the fraudulent selling of a synthetic CDO tied to subprime mortgages.[18] With Blankfein at the helm, Goldman has also been criticized "by lawmakers and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in helping Greece mask the size of its debts".[18]
In April 2011, a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Senator Carl Levin alleged that Blankfein misled Congress, though no perjury charges have been brought against Blankfein.[19][20][21] In August of the same year, Goldman confirmed that Blankfein had hired high-profile defense lawyer Reid Weingarten,[22] who had previously represented executives including former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey.[23] Two months later, in November 2011, Blankfein was listed as #43 on Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People.
In March 2012, a former Goldman executive, Greg Smith, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled "Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs", in which he heavily criticized the firm's top leadership and Blankfein in particular."[24] Smith's op-ed was criticized by many, particularly because he worked at Goldman for 12 years before deciding to quit due to moral objections.[24]
Politics[edit]
With regard to his personal political views, Blankfein has described himself as "a registered Democrat, and a Rockefeller Republican ... conservative on fiscal issues and more liberal on social issues".[25] Blankfein contributes to mostly Democratic party candidates and donated $4,600 to Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in 2007.[26] He is a supporter of gay marriage and has been a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.[27] In May 2012, Blankfein stated that his stance led Goldman Sachs to lose some clients.[28] Blankfein has visited the White House 14 times as of January 2013.[29] In 2015, he contributed to the Senate re-election campaigns for the Republicans Rob Portman and Roy Blunt. After 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in January 2016 named Blankfein as an example of corporate greed, Blankfein responded that Sanders' campaign had "the potential to be a dangerous moment."[30]
On April 7, 2009, he recommended guidelines to overhaul executive compensation. According to The New York Times, he said that lessons from the global financial crisis included the need to "apply basic standards to how we compensate people in our industry".[31] In November 2009, he declared in an interview, as a banker: "I'm doing God's work."[32] Several days later he indicated that he regretted that remark and said he had intended it as a joke. He also apologized on behalf of Goldman Sachs to the public for unspecified "things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret" and which contributed to the financial and economic crisis. The firm announced a 10,000 small businesses initiative, committing $500 million to aid American small businesses.[33]
On July 18, 2012, he commented about the effect of the Libor scandal on the financial system, "There was this huge hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it's just that much deeper." [34] The same day he met Jack Lew, President Barack Obama's chief of staff, and over lunch at the Economic Club of Washington was asked whether he had any aspiration to go into government like predecessors Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. "I have aspirations to be desired," he replied.[35]
On June 1, 2017, Blankfein posted his first ever tweet, despite joining the social media service in 2011. He condemned President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Accord, saying "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement".
Philanthropy[edit]
Blankfein formerly served on the board of trustees of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization, whose goal is to alleviate poverty in New York.[36] He serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for New York City,[37] and on the board of overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College.[38][39]
Personal life[edit]
Blankfein is married to Laura Jacobs, an attorney and the daughter of Norman S. Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of the Foreign Policy Association publications.[5] The couple have two sons, Alexander and Jonathan, and a daughter, Rachel.[6][40][41] On September 22, 2015, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying Blankfein had been diagnosed with a highly treatable form of lymphoma.[42] He received a treatment of chemotherapy.[43] By October 2016, he explained he was cured.[44]
Blankfein and his wife reside primarily in Manhattan's Upper West Side, but they also maintain a home in Bridgehampton, New York, as well as another house, set on 2.65 acres, in Sagaponack, New York.[6]

Aron & Co., which was later acquired by Goldman, as a precious metals salesman in its London office. Blankfein managed or co-managed the Goldman Sachs Currency and Commodities Division from 1994 to 1997.[11] He served as vice chairman from April 2002 until January 2004, and was in charge of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) and Equities Division.[11]
Blankfein has served as chairman and chief executive officer since 2006. He earned a total of $54.4 million in 2006 as one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street. His bonus reflected the performance of Goldman Sachs, which reported record net earnings of $9.5 billion. The compensation included a cash bonus of $27.3 million, with the rest paid in stock and options. While CEO of Goldman Sachs Group in 2007, Blankfein earned a total compensation of $53,965,418, which included a base salary of $600,000, a cash bonus of $26,985,474, stocks granted of $15,542,756 and options granted of $10,453,031.[12] He received US$23 million in salary and bonuses in 2015, which was slightly down from the US$24 million he earned in 2014 from Goldman Sachs.[13][14]
In 2009, the Financial Times named Blankfein its "2009 Person of the Year", stating, "His bank has stuck to its strengths, unashamedly taken advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits."[4][15]

On April 7, 2009, he recommended guidelines to overhaul executive compensation. According to The New York Times, he said that lessons from the global financial crisis included the need to "apply basic standards to how we compensate people in our industry".[31] In November 2009, he declared in an interview, as a banker: "I'm doing God's work."[32] Several days later he indicated that he regretted that remark and said he had intended it as a joke. He also apologized on behalf of Goldman Sachs to the public for unspecified "things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret" and which contributed to the financial and economic crisis. The firm announced a 10,000 small businesses initiative, committing $500 million to aid American small businesses.[33]
On July 18, 2012, he commented about the effect of the Libor scandal on the financial system, "There was this huge hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it's just that much deeper." [34] The same day he met Jack Lew, President Barack Obama's chief of staff, and over lunch at the Economic Club of Washington was asked whether he had any aspiration to go into government like predecessors Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. "I have aspirations to be desired," he replied.[35]
On June 1, 2017, Blankfein posted his first ever tweet, despite joining the social media service in 2011. He condemned President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Accord, saying "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement".
Philanthropy[edit]
Blankfein formerly served on the board of trustees of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization, whose goal is to alleviate poverty in New York.[36] He serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for New York City,[37] and on the board of overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College.[38][39]
Personal life[edit]
Blankfein is married to Laura Jacobs, an attorney and the daughter of Norman S. Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of the Foreign Policy Association publications.[5] The couple have two sons, Alexander and Jonathan, and a daughter, Rachel.[6][40][41] On September 22, 2015, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying Blankfein had been diagnosed with a highly treatable form of lymphoma.[42] He received a treatment of chemotherapy.[43] By October 2016, he explained he was cured.[44]
Blankfein and his wife reside primarily in Manhattan's Upper West Side, but they also maintain a home in Bridgehampton, New York, as well as another house, set on 2.65 acres, in Sagaponack, New York.[6]

Early life[edit]
Lloyd Blankfein was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, to a Jewish family, and reared in the Linden Houses, a New York City Housing Authority project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.[2][3] His father, Seymour Blankfein,[4] was a clerk with the U.S. Postal Service branch in the Manhattan borough of New York City and his mother was a receptionist.[5][6] As a boy, he worked as a concession vendor at Yankee Stadium.[6] He received primary and secondary education in the public schools of the New York City Department of Education, and was the valedictorian at Thomas Jefferson High School in 1971. He attended Harvard College, where he lived in Winthrop House, majored in History[7][8] and earned his A.B. in 1975.[6][9] In 1978, Blankfein received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.[6][9]
Career[edit]
Before working at Goldman Sachs, Blankfein worked for Proskauer Rose[10] and then Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine. In 1982, he joined the commodities trading firm J. Aron & Co., which was later acquired by Goldman, as a precious metals salesman in its London office. Blankfein managed or co-managed the Goldman Sachs Currency and Commodities Division from 1994 to 1997.[11] He served as vice chairman from April 2002 until January 2004, and was in charge of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) and Equities Division.[11]
Blankfein has served as chairman and chief executive officer since 2006. He earned a total of $54.4 million in 2006 as one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street. His bonus reflected the performance of Goldman Sachs, which reported record net earnings of $9.5 billion. The compensation included a cash bonus of $27.3 million, with the rest paid in stock and options. While CEO of Goldman Sachs Group in 2007, Blankfein earned a total compensation of $53,965,418, which included a base salary of $600,000, a cash bonus of $26,985,474, stocks granted of $15,542,756 and options granted of $10,453,031.[12] He received US$23 million in salary and bonuses in 2015, which was slightly down from the US$24 million he earned in 2014 from Goldman Sachs.[13][14]
In 2009, the Financial Times named Blankfein its "2009 Person of the Year", stating, "His bank has stuck to its strengths, unashamedly taken advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits."[4][15]
On January 13, 2010, Blankfein testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that he considered Goldman Sachs's role as primarily a market maker, not a creator of the product (i.e., subprime mortgage-related securities).[16] Blankfein testified before Congress in April 2010 at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He said that Goldman Sachs had no moral or legal obligation to inform its clients it was betting against the products which they were buying from Goldman Sachs because it was not acting in a fiduciary role.[17] The company was sued on April 16, 2010, by the SEC for the fraudulent selling of a synthetic CDO tied to subprime mortgages.[18] With Blankfein at the helm, Goldman has also been criticized "by lawmakers and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in helping Greece mask the size of its debts".[18]
In April 2011, a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Senator Carl Levin alleged that Blankfein misled Congress, though no perjury charges have been brought against Blankfein.[19][20][21] In August of the same year, Goldman confirmed that Blankfein had hired high-profile defense lawyer Reid Weingarten,[22] who had previously represented executives including former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey.[23] Two months later, in November 2011, Blankfein was listed as #43 on Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People.
In March 2012, a former Goldman executive, Greg Smith, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled "Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs", in which he heavily criticized the firm's top leadership and Blankfein in particular."[24] Smith's op-ed was criticized by many, particularly because he worked at Goldman for 12 years before deciding to quit due to moral objections.[24]
Politics[edit]
With regard to his personal political views, Blankfein has described himself as "a registered Democrat, and a Rockefeller Republican ... conservative on fiscal issues and more liberal on social issues".[25] Blankfein contributes to mostly Democratic party candidates and donated $4,600 to Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in 2007.[26] He is a supporter of gay marriage and has been a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.[27] In May 2012, Blankfein stated that his stance led Goldman Sachs to lose some clients.[28] Blankfein has visited the White House 14 times as of January 2013.[29] In 2015, he contributed to the Senate re-election campaigns for the Republicans Rob Portman and Roy Blunt. After 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in January 2016 named Blankfein as an example of corporate greed, Blankfein responded that Sanders' campaign had "the potential to be a dangerous moment."[30]
On April 7, 2009, he recommended guidelines to overhaul executive compensation. According to The New York Times, he said that lessons from the global financial crisis included the need to "apply basic standards to how we compensate people in our industry".[31] In November 2009, he declared in an interview, as a banker: "I'm doing God's work."[32] Several days later he indicated that he regretted that remark and said he had intended it as a joke. He also apologized on behalf of Goldman Sachs to the public for unspecified "things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret" and which contributed to the financial and economic crisis. The firm announced a 10,000 small businesses initiative, committing $500 million to aid American small businesses.[33]
On July 18, 2012, he commented about the effect of the Libor scandal on the financial system, "There was this huge hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it's just that much deeper." [34] The same day he met Jack Lew, President Barack Obama's chief of staff, and over lunch at the Economic Club of Washington was asked whether he had any aspiration to go into government like predecessors Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. "I have aspirations to be desired," he replied.[35]
On June 1, 2017, Blankfein posted his first ever tweet, despite joining the social media service in 2011. He condemned President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Accord, saying "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement".
Philanthropy[edit]
Blankfein formerly served on the board of trustees of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization, whose goal is to alleviate poverty in New York.[36] He serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for New York City,[37] and on the board of overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College.[38][39]
Personal life[edit]
Blankfein is married to Laura Jacobs, an attorney and the daughter of Norman S. Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of the Foreign Policy Association publications.[5] The couple have two sons, Alexander and Jonathan, and a daughter, Rachel.[6][40][41] On September 22, 2015, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying Blankfein had been diagnosed with a highly treatable form of lymphoma.[42] He received a treatment of chemotherapy.[43] By October 2016, he explained he was cured.[44]
Blankfein and his wife reside primarily in Manhattan's Upper West Side, but they also maintain a home in Bridgehampton, New York, as well as another house, set on 2.65 acres, in Sagaponack, New York.[6]

Here's what Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is telling clients about uncertainty in the market

Goldman
  Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

Goldman

  Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has heard enough people talk
  about uncertainty in the markets lately that, he says, it's
  starting to sound "trite."


  So in 
  a recent video posted on Goldman Sachs' website, Blankfein
  delved into the causes of that uncertainty and why, in his view,
  everything would be OK.


  "I hear from our clients, 'Where are things going to go? What
  should we do?'" Blankfein said. "And I'll tell you: It's
  uncertain for a reason, because there are a lot of new things
  going on."


  The Trump administration is expected to take a significantly
  different policy stance not only from the Obama administration's,
  he said, but also from what we might have expected from
  Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.


  "That's a very wide gap," Blankfein said, "and most of those
  policy changes are in the nature of stimulus."


  Under Trump, Blankfein said, we can expect to see less
  regulation, rather than more; lower taxes, rather than higher;
  and a bigger commitment to infrastructure spending. That has
  boosted gross-domestic-product expectations and optimism.


  Blankfein 
  last May described the "low confidence" environment in the
  US and its impacts on various businesses within Goldman
  Sachs. At the time he said there were "signs on the horizon" that
  we were moving away from that period, including rising employment
  levels, low energy prices, and the Federal Reserve's decision to
  start raising interest rates.

  Blankfein said, however, that the positive turn the markets had
  taken since Trump's election should be viewed in the wider
  context of a previously evolving macroeconomic environment.
  Expectations for rising interest rates, for example, were already
  baked in before the election.


  Blankfein has previously said the market rally that followed
  Trump's electoral win was a continuation of a trend.


  "It was drawing people in the direction that it was already
  heading," the chief executive 
  said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in
  January.


  'Change in general creates opportunity'


  In this week's video, he pointed to some potential adjustments
  ahead, including diverging currency rates as a result of
  diverging economic performance.


  "The cost of that divergence, you'll get differences in interest
  rates that could very well lead to differences in currency
  rates," Blankfein said.


  But that doesn't mean we're in unprecedented times, he said.


  "It's a vanity, always, at any given moment, to think, 'My
  goodness we have challenges of a dimension we've never seen
  before — the world is more uncertain,'" he said.


  "It always seems uncertain when you're living in it, and it
  always seems so simple and sure when you're looking back at it."


  Instead, Blankfein said, we're simply undergoing a change from a
  cycle of low economic activity, very low interest rates, and a
  high level of pessimism about the future. Now markets are seeing
  more growth potential, more opportunity, and more optimism.


  "So I'd say change in general creates opportunity," he said, "but
  change from a pessimistic state of mind to one of more optimism
  is the better of the two possibilities."

The CEO of Goldman Sachs just talked about China in a way we've never heard before

  Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has been bullish on China for
  years, but at a briefing hosted by The Wall Street Journal on
  Wednesday morning he slammed the country's handling of market
  forces as amateurish.

  Blankfein said it was a "ham-handed way they dealt with the
  collapse," referring to government intervention when the
  country's stock market collapsed twice this summer.

  "They don't have a lot of experience at this market stuff."

  These are the harshest words about the Chinese economy we've
  heard from the generally optimistic Blankfein, and they get to
  the heart of how investors' views on China have changed over the
  past few months.

  Investors are starting to question how the Chinese government is
  managing its unique system.





  But back to Blankfein. In an interview with Bloomberg TV back in
  July, he sounded more like his usual bullish self and asked host
  Stephanie Ruhle:

  "Just as a thought experiment, thinking in the short-term and
  long-term, if I said you have to — Would you invest in China for
  the next year? — think of your answer to that question. And then
  if I said to you, you had to invest within, for 20 years, but you
  couldn't touch it for 20 years — it was for your children — would
  you invest in China for the next 20 years?"

  His point was that China was a great investment opportunity.
  That's the standard line.

  Back in 2013, when Goldman sold its stake in Chinese bank ICBC,
  he went on a media tour reiterating the bank's bullish stance on
  the country's future.

  A year later, he told Charlie Rose that China's rise already
  meant a new world order.

  "Well, you know, you can look at it in the worst terms," he said.
  "US has a competitor. In the best terms, there's no locus."

  But on Wednesday he sounded less optimistic, painting a picture
  of a clumsily managed economy.

  China is focused on "10% growth at any cost," he said.

  It's a target out of reach for the foreseeable future. Most Wall
  Street analysts have Chinese gross-domestic-product growth
  sitting at around 6.5%. Others say it's actually somewhere around
  4% to 5%.

  Blankfein continued: "They'll put a smoke belching factory in the
  middle of a city ... In China, when they want to pump up their
  economy ... they build 82 airports."

  He added that 30 of them would be in the wrong location.

  Blankfein has always recognized that this way of allocating
  resources for growth is fundamental to the Chinese model. The
  question now is whether it's a model the government can manage
  effectively.

  At the briefing on Wednesday, one attendee asked Blankfein about
  China's role as the biggest holder of US debt. He responded that
  he would rather the Chinese have a stake in America's future than
  vice versa.

  "I'd rather they hold our debt than we hold their debt," he said.
  "I'd rather owe money to the Chinese; they have a stake in our
  success. During the financial crisis they were worried about us.
  We weren't worried about them."

  But a lot of things have changed since then.

 Following a recent trip to Beijing, Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein discusses why he believes the mood in China today is one of confidence, stability and “a sense of place in the world.” Despite China’s challenges, Blankfein highlights a relatively strong growth rate and a strong commitment to infrastructure as contributing factors to China’s sense of optimism.

But then the questions kept coming — and coming and coming.        
Through the day and into the evening, Goldman Sachs officials met with confrontation and blunt questioning as senators from both parties challenged them over their aggressive marketing of mortgage investments at a time when the housing market was already starting to falter.        
In an atmosphere charged by public animosity toward Wall Street, the senators compared the bankers to bookies and asked why Goldman had sold investments that its own sales team had disparaged with a vulgarity.        
“The idea that Wall Street came out of this thing just fine, thank you, is just something that just grates on people,” said Senator Edward E. Kaufman Jr., a Democrat from Delaware. “They think you didn’t just come out fine because it was luck. They think you guys just really gamed this thing real well.”        
But throughout a subcommittee hearing lasting more than 10 hours, current and former Goldman officials insisted that they had done nothing to mislead their clients. Time and again, the senators and the Goldman executives, among them the chairman and chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, seemed to be talking past each other.        
Among the Goldman retinue was Fabrice P. Tourre, a vice president who helped create and sell a mortgage investment that figures in a fraud suit filed this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.        
Mr. Tourre defended his role in the sale of the investment. In his opening remarks to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Mr. Tourre declared: “I deny, categorically, the S.E.C.’s allegation. And I will defend myself in court against this false claim.”        
Senate investigators are building on the S.E.C. case, which accuses Goldman of defrauding investors in a transaction called Abacus 2007-AC1.        
The hearing was held against the backdrop of a debate about overhauling financial regulation. During the questioning, senators highlighted the need for greater openness and questioned the ethics of the financial sector.        
At one point, the Goldman witnesses were asked what they would change in the regulatory system.        
“Clearly some things need to be changed,” said Daniel L. Sparks, a former partner and head of the mortgage trading department in the Goldman Sachs Group, who was one of the four initial witnesses.        
Steering away from financial jargon, the senators tried to put a human face on the questioning. Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, declared that more transparency was needed “so we don’t end up hurting the little guys out there on Main Street.”        
A Republican member, Senator Susan M. Collins of Maine, turned from one witness to the next as she asked repeatedly whether they felt a duty to act in the best interest of their clients. Only one of the four witnesses she questioned seemed to affirm such a duty outright.        
In what almost added up to a light moment, Senator Mark L. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, said the public wanted to know what went wrong and “how we can fix it,” adding that Americans feel that Wall Street contributed to the financial crisis. “People feel like you are betting with other people’s money and other people’s future,” he said. “Instead of Wall Street, it looks like Las Vegas.”        
Senator Ensign said he took offense at the comparison, saying that in Las Vegas the casinos do not manipulate the odds while you are playing the game. The better analogy, he said, would be to someone playing a slot machine while the “guys on Wall Street” were “tweaking the odds in their favor.”        
The gap between Wall Street and the rest of the country was a recurring theme, with senators occasionally pointing out how much Goldman, and indeed the witnesses, had profited as the overall economy was headed for a plunge.        
Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, mentioned during her questioning that she was trying to “home in on why I have so many unemployed people” and lost money in pensions.        
The questioning Tuesday put the Goldman witnesses on the defensive, with the senators expressing exasperation that they were deliberately dodging questions or stalling for time.        
It was at 10:01 a.m., one minute late, when the session began with opening remarks from subcommittee chairman, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. The public galleries, accommodating roughly 100 people, were full and included four people dressed in mock striped prison jumpsuits who jeered at the Goldman officials.        
“How do you live with yourself, Fab?” one shouted as Mr. Tourre was ushered out of the chamber after his testimony.        
A tone of confrontation was set at the beginning, with Senator Levin’s opening remarks. He said the questioning would focus on the role of investment banks in the financial crisis, and particularly on the activities of Goldman Sachs in 2007, which “contributed to the economic collapse that came full blown the following year.”        
While the hearing had ramifications for the entire sector and the activities of lenders to make more money from risky mortgage loans, Senator Levin added, it was focusing on Goldman as an “active player in building this mortgage machinery.”        
He said that while the S.E.C. suit and the courts would address the legality of its activities, “the question for us is one of ethics and policy: were Goldman’s actions in 2007 appropriate, and if not, should we act to bar similar actions in the future?”        
In addition to Mr. Tourre and Mr. Sparks, Goldman executives testifying included Joshua S. Birnbaum, a former managing director in the structured products group trading, and Michael J. Swenson, another managing director in that group.        
A second panel included David A. Viniar, executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Craig W. Broderick, the chief risk officer.        
At one point Mr. Viniar prompted a collective gasp when Mr. Levin asked him how he felt when he learned that Goldman employees had used vulgar terms to describe the poor quality of certain Goldman deals. Mr. Viniar replied, “I think that’s very unfortunate to have on e-mail.”        
Senator Levin then berated Mr. Viniar for not saying that he was appalled that Goldman employees even thought their deals were of poor quality, much less put it in e-mail. Mr. Viniar later apologized.        
As the hearing stretched into the evening, Mr. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief, entered the chamber with an almost angry demeanor. In a brief prepared statement, he held tight to Goldman’s defenses.        
Later, asked if he knew the housing market was doomed, Mr. Blankfein replied, “I think we’re not that smart.”        
Mr. Blankfein was asked repeatedly whether Goldman sold securities that it also bet against, and whether Goldman treated those clients properly.        
“You say betting against,” Mr. Blankfein said in a lengthy exchange. But he said the people who were coming to Goldman for risk in the housing market got just that: exposure to the housing market. “The unfortunate thing,” he said, “is that the housing market went south very quickly.”        
Senator Levin pressed Mr. Blankfein again on whether his customers should know what Goldman workers think of deals they are selling, and Mr. Blankfein reiterated his position that sophisticated investors should be allowed to buy what they want.        
Mr. Blankfein was also pressed on the deal at the center of the S.E.C. case. He said the investment was not meant to fail, as the S.E.C. claims, and in fact, that the deal was a success, in that it conveyed “risk that people wanted to have, and in a market that’s not a failure.”        
To which Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, replied, “It’s like we’re speaking a different language here.”         
Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.

 In the discussion moderated by Edith Cooper, global head of Human Capital Management, Lloyd highlighted the importance of teamwork in the firm’s culture: "You can't do everything. You have to pick what you want to do, and what you want other people to do. To be effective, galvanize a team and make everybody on the team better."
 He also discussed his more than thirty years at the firm, growing up in Brooklyn and on Wall Street and the advice he'd give to his younger self.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
