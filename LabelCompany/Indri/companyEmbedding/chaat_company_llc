What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

WHO WE ARE
We Are Indian.
And American.
Indian food has rarely been considered cool. In a culture bursting with energy, color and tradition, we only tend to see it expressed in poorly-lit, Taj Mahal-themed restaurants slinging all-you-can-eat buffets.
We’re on a mission to shock the standards of Indian cuisine armed with its bold street snacks. Chaat is fresh. It’s alive with crunch and spice and tang. It hits with the flavor impact of a tornado. It’s unlike any other cuisine in the world, and it’s been around for thousands of years.
It’s a bite against boredom, and we’d like to share it with you.

My Story







Anshu Dua
Co-Founder





My very first memory is of frantically running down the stairs of my home in Chandigarh and squeezing my way onto a crowded rickshaw. I was 3 years old and I had no fear. Along with fifteen other kids, sitting on wooden boards hanging off the ends, this was my school bus.
I was born in India, but in the early 80’s, my parents packed all their possessions into eight very large suitcases and, with my older sister, we flew to America on a Pan Am jumbo jet.
We learned to adapt to our new country and I became an American kid. I watched MTV, tried to understand the rules of football, ate Filet-o-Fish sandwiches (no beef in our house), drove everywhere in our light blue station wagon.
Occasionally I forgot where I was. During my kindergarten entrance test, the teacher pointed to a number of objects that I had to vocally identify in English. We got through the first few, piece of cake. Then she pointed to a paper bag, and I instinctively screamed out “la-fa-fa” – the Hindi equivalent – only to quickly correct myself hoping my chances of going to school weren’t dashed. True story my parents still tell to this day with a laugh, and a hint of pride I was clinging to my roots.
Being immigrants meant we spent our summer vacations back in India. Our entire summer vacation. My parents insisted it was important to keep in touch with our culture, our heritage, our language, our extended family.
But, to me, it meant good-bye to ice-cream sundaes with extra hot fudge, barbecues, all-day-Nintendo marathons, roller coasters at Disney and sleepovers. I wanted to be with my American friends and do summer-time American things.
Then suddenly, I had a career, business cards with a long title, hippie start-up t-shirts, stock options, venture capital frenemies, elevator pitches — many elevator pitches. Exit strategies. Yes, life in the fast lane.
Neurons started firing about those summers many years ago. Lazy chess matches with my grandfather. Frantically running up to the roof to clear the clothesline before the impending monsoon. Riding on my uncle’s scooter to pick up fresh samosas & jalebis for afternoon chai. Badminton. Endless badminton. Trying to speak Hindi. Kite fights on the roof with the neighbors. Google it.
I missed it. I needed to reconnect. To climb back on that rickshaw.
This is my way.

My greatest memories are of food. It wasn’t some sort of destiny. It started, if you can imagine, with the launch of the Food Network which lured me away from cartoons at a young age. I watched David Rosengarten, Sara Moulton and Bobby Flay. I watched Emeril Lagasse religiously. Bam.
I knew, better than any 10-year old I’ve ever known, who I was and what I wanted to be.

My greatest memories are of food. It wasn’t some sort of destiny. It started, if you can imagine, with the launch of the Food Network which lured me away from cartoons at a young age. I watched David Rosengarten, Sara Moulton and Bobby Flay. I watched Emeril Lagasse religiously. Bam.
I knew, better than any 10-year old I’ve ever known, who I was and what I wanted to be.
My parents were good cooks, and I always tried to help them as a means to bolster my education. We cooked a lot of Indian food, though my mum, from Singapore, also dabbled in Chinese. They were usually in a rush to get something on the table so for extra credit on weekends I would go over to my aunt’s house and cook with her.
My dad’s eldest sister did not cook mainly Indian like her siblings. She made lasagna. Fish. Even burgers on the 4th of July. Really crazy stuff like that.
My fate was sealed the first time I walked into the kitchen of a fine-dining restaurant in Singapore that my cousin had an interest in. She’d convinced the French-trained chef to babysit a 12-year old who was technically on summer vacation. On my first day, I rolled out pasta. On my second, I shucked oysters. By my third, I never wanted to leave.
I forwent college in favor of culinary school with 3 restaurant summer jobs under my belt. I secured an internship at then the #1 restaurant in the world, The Fat Duck. I came to New York City and cooked at The Gramercy Tavern.
I studied wine and cocktails and service, working through Eleven Madison Park and Blue Hill at Stone Barns. I worked every restaurant position I possibly could, all the way up to General Manager. And I realized that I didn’t know who I was or what I wanted to be.
Soon after, on a visit to my parents, we ate an Indian meal at the table I grew up at. And for the first time in my life, I devoured it not wishing there was also a steak or fries or sushi. And I got to thinking…

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
