Help Marcia walk again

by Jonathon Colman Posted on September 26, 2016 



Please donate or share from this YouCaring page to help Marcia Huhta walk again.

Marcia Huhta needs your help
You may not know my mother in law, Marcia Huhta, but on June 6th, Marcia’s life changed forever.
That’s the day that Marcia and her husband, Matti, survived a head-on car collision.
Marcia was rescued from the wrecked vehicle with the jaws of life and air-lifted to a hospital for life-saving spinal surgery. But months later, Marcia’s in a wheelchair and has limited movement and sensation below her neck.
Donate or share to help Marcia walk
That’s why my wife and I are raising money to help Marcia get the medical care she needs to walk again.
Please donate—but if you can’t, please SHARE THIS LINK: youcaring.com/marcia-huhta-654257
It’s not enough to just like or heart this—every share counts! Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn… fire up your MySpace again. YouCaring says that every share is worth about $37 on average, so if you can’t donate, please consider sharing this with your friends—and ask them to do the same!
About Marcia Huhta

Marcia and Matti Huhta dancing at their 50th wedding anniversary.

Marcia Huhta is a loving mother of five children, grandmother to three, and great-grandmother to another two. She’s a lector at All Hallows Church, which she attended daily. Marcia was also an officer in the local Finnish-American Heritage Society for years. She also worked as a nurse at the Villa Maria Nursing & Rehabilitation facility for over 3 decades. Marcia is adored by her family, patients, colleagues, and her local community.
But there’s more: Marcia loves to dance. Square dances, waltzes, foxtrots, lindy hops, charlestons… watch the video above of Marcia dancing a polka with Matti at her 50th wedding anniversary. She performed with the Revontulet Dancers, a non-profit Finnish dancing troupe in Massachusetts.
Marcia has rhythm on her feet, a rhapsody in each step, but more than that, she also has grace—a rare gift given to someone who gave so much to her family, her patients, her church, and her community.
How your donations help Marcia

Marcia and Matti Huhta need your help—please donate or share at YouCaring.

We’re asking you to give Marcia another gift: your donations. Marcia needs long-term care, the best treatments, and world-class physical therapy to walk again, to dance again, even to hold her great-grandchildren again. And these treatments are out of her and her husband’s financial reach.
Your donations will pay for expenses like:

Colossal medical bills that have spiralled out of her family’s control
Long-term care in a skilled nursing facility that provides physical and occupational therapy
Improved treatments and therapies focused on helping her build strength, reduce pain, and stay healthy
Technologies that connect her with family & friends, since she’s unable to leave the facility she’s in
Additional medical care, transport, consultants, treatments, and other needs

Please donate to support Marcia on YouCaring. Your donation goes directly to Marcia and Matti Huhta and you’ll only be charged a credit card transaction fee.
Let’s help Marcia walk again
Marcia Huhta’s life has changed forever, and we’re going to change it again—by getting her back on her feet.
We want to see her walk, we want to see her dance, we want to see her hold her great-grandchildren again… but we need your help.
Please donate now!

Wicked Ambiguity and User Experience

by Jonathon Colman Posted on May 21, 2015 


Following are the video, slides, description, and transcript for my keynote talk, Wicked Ambiguity. See the acknowledgments for more information about my sources, influences, and the people who helped me along the way.
Video

Slides
 
Description
Wicked Ambiguity and User Experience
How do you solve the world’s hardest problems? And how would you respond if they’re unsolvable? As user experience professionals, we’re focused on people who live and work in the here and now. We dive into research, define the problem, break down silos, and focus on people’s intent to create solutions.
But how does our UX work change when a project lasts not for one year, or even 10 years, but for 10,000 years or more? Enter the “Wicked Problem,” or situations with so much ambiguity, complexity, and interdependencies that—by definition—they can’t be solved.
Using real-world examples from NASA’s Voyager program, the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository, and other long-term UX efforts, we’ll talk about the challenges of creating solutions for people whom we’ll never know in our lifetimes. The ways we grapple with ambiguity give us a new perspective on our work and on what it means to build experiences that last.
Transcript
Introduction
Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells.
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
Let us go and make our visit. (source)
Welcome to Wicked Ambiguity, a journey through time and space spanning 2.8 trillion years and 1.2 quadrillion miles.
This talk isn’t about me or my work. It’s about you and why you matter.
I’m dedicating this talk not to J. Alfred Prufrock, but instead to Leonard Nimoy. While he’s best known for “Star Trek,” you may not know that Leonard was also the host of TV’s “In Search Of…,” in which he looked for answers to long-standing mysteries of the unknown.
And you know what? You do that, too. We’re all just nerds looking for answers—and Leonard helped make it safe for us to be geeks, to be introverts, and to be fascinated by the universe that surrounds us.
“We’re all stories in the end,” (source) after all, so I won’t say rest in peace, but rather, “Live long and prosper.”
About Our Journey

Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine.

I’m your host for the next hour while we boldly go through the vast reaches of time and space. I’ll make sure none of us gets lost and everyone makes it back. But fair warning: the people who return won’t be the same as the ones who leave.
Got somewhere else to be? No worries! You can get these slides now at bit.ly/raycats—don’t worry, I promise that’ll make more sense by the end. Note, you need to use all lower-case letters or the link won’t work.
Let’s start with a memory; most things in the past do.
Do you remember being a child and your parents telling you, “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine.” (source) But you really thought they were lying just to make you feel better because it was dark, you were scared, and you didn’t know what to expect?
Kind of like in this keynote? Well, then. “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine.”
It’s a story we tell to project confidence and security. But it’s a hard promise to make. We can’t even predict the location and movements of a single atom—let alone complex things like world events, the stock market, or whether it’ll be nice out on Thursday.
So maybe, just maybe, everything’s not going to be fine. What then?
This symbol is taken from one of the Pioneer satellites launched by NASA in the ‘60s. It was also used on Voyager, the furthest man-made object from the Earth, spinning from out of the blue and into the black.
Today we’ll talk about this symbol and what it means. We’ll also cover a lot of science and math, but almost no science fiction—even though the ideas we’re discussing are fantastical. But other than quotes from books and TV shows like “Doctor Who,” everything you’re about to see is real. It’s true. And it’s troubling.
Some of you will leave today saying “This talk has NOTHING to do with user experience!” Others will say, “This talk has EVERYTHING to do with user experience!”
Guess what? You’re both right. Continue reading →

Why You Should Go to Confab

by Jonathon Colman Posted on March 11, 2015 



Welcome to Confab Central: the content strategy conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. © Sean Tubridy/Brain Traffic (used with permission)

This post is nearly two years too late.
I should have written it back in 2013 after I attended Confab Central in Minneapolis for the first time. The conference had already been around for a few years and I thought that I was late to the game. I was worried that I’d come across like a real n00b, out of my league and behind in the conversation.
But it wasn’t like that at all. There were so many smart people there, good people, the kind of people where the conversation just keeps on flowing on its own. I learned so much, hugged so many folks, laughed so hard I spilled my coffee (again, my apologies to the Hyatt Regency). They were so open, so welcoming—it almost felt like coming home.
But now it’s 2015. I’ll be giving the opening keynote at Confab Central this year. So this post is late—I should have written it back in 2013 because now you won’t believe me when I tell you about Confab. You’ll say I’m biased.
So let me be clear about this: when it comes to Confab, I am biased. Extremely biased. Biased like your Aunt Suzy.
But I’m not biased because they’re paying me—I can’t accept any payment for speaking, so instead we’re making a donation to Girls Who Code, a great nonprofit with a mission I believe in.
Rather, I’m biased because the experience of attending Confab is just so amazing. And I want to share that bias with you openly, in plain sight, so that you can experience the same things I have.
Here’s why you should join me at Confab Central this year. Continue reading →

Secret Wars

by Jonathon Colman Posted on February 25, 2015

Cross-published on Medium.
In 1984—when they told us that the Soviets boycotting the Olympics in Los Angeles wasn’t such a big deal, really—Marvel Comics published Secret Wars. It was such an amazing comic book series… nothing like it had ever been done before. Heroes and villains from dozens of separate titles all duking it out together over the course of a year.
To my hungry, nine-year-old eyes, it was hard to tell who the heroes were because sometimes they turned out to be the villains. And some of the villains were really just misunderstood heroes. To me, it was the very peak of drama. Every panel was like a movie, each issue an epic.
What I didn’t understand at the time was the series’ political parallels: Ronald Reagan was running a secret war of his own, quietly selling arms to Iran to fund rebel forces in Nicaragua.
So I devoured each issue like an addict, flipping the pages at a staccato pace. And my addiction spread quickly—Secret Wars made me a comics fan for over a decade. And as I grew up, it lead me to bigger (and better) stories.
Stories like these three, which are about the real secret wars. They’re the dark battles that remain unspoken, lurking on the fringes and hiding in plain sight. They’re the conspiracies of silence caused by the things we can’t say.
Those are wars, too. We wage them with the people closest to us, but never admit to their existence… or to the damage they cause.
The things that hurt us the most are the ones we can’t speak of. They pull at us in the smallest, the most intimate of ways. They break us with their banality. Or sometimes they just break us.
Here are three stories from the front.  Continue reading →

How to Get One Million Views on SlideShare

by Jonathon Colman Posted on May 27, 2014 



One million views on SlideShare… and counting.Image © SlideShare

On the week of January 12, 2014, I cracked the one million views mark for my presentations on SlideShare. I’m now well on the road to two million.
I’m definitely not the first (or the only) one to reach this point. Many presentations have hundreds of thousands of views – a few even have millions. And since several publishers on SlideShare are quite prolific, there must be numerous accounts who have reached – and far surpassed – this sum.
Even so, I did a happy dance. Can you blame me? I was an early adopter of SlideShare; my first upload dates back to July 21, 2007. That’s nearly seven years’ worth of use. I started using SlideShare less than a year after posting my first tweet and first status update on Facebook.
You might be aware that there are benefits to being an early adopter of a nascent network. Even so, if you’ve ever seen me speak, then you know that a favorite topic of mine is my own non-exceptionalism. I can’t think of anything I’ve done that anyone else couldn’t do (or do better).
So I believe that with the right methods and approach, just about anyone can reach one million views on SlideShare. My goal is to help you do that.
Do great work that’s worthy of being shared
 
Out of all of my presentations, the above talk on core values is my favorite. It took me seven years of practice to create something of this level of quality. It may not be a big accomplishment to you; that’s okay – it was to me. And hopefully I can do much better work in the future.
While it should go without saying that we have to challenge ourselves to do the best we can, how would you explain why there are so many bad presentations being given so often? To understand, we have to start from a position of empathy; I think that the majority of bad talks aren’t given on purpose.
Most of the time, I think that speakers are in a rush, or haven’t prepared well, or are nervous, or are distracted, or don’t understand how to design slides, or don’t want to speak in the first place, or feel intimidated, or aren’t held accountable to give a good performance, or any number of other factors and challenges. I certainly know what all that feels like; I’ve given bad talks under circumstances just like these.
The good news is that all of these problems can be solved, all of these weaknesses can be improved upon.
Don’t believe me? Take a look at my first few presentations. I leave them online in my SlideShare account to remind me of how I started out – with no natural talent, design sense, or storytelling ability.
My recent talks look much better and have far more views and shares.
The rest of this post explains is an introduction to how I made that happen. Continue reading →

How to Hack Your Self-Review

by Jonathon Colman Posted on January 6, 2014 



Hack your review, hack yourself.Photo © johngineer

Once again, it’s time to write your annual self-review. Just like last year (and the year before), Review Season sneaked up on you when you weren’t looking.
Now you’ve landed on this page after raiding Google for tips and tricks, hoping to find some secret key or formula that will help you ace your written self-evaluation so that you can get back to… well, whatever it is you’re doing instead of preparing for your review.
No such luck. There’s no hidden back door, no algorithm to fool, no “one weird trick” to get around evaluating yourself and your actions.
If you were successful in your work this year, you’ll need to weigh the merits of touting that success versus coming off like a braggart. But if you failed to meet your goals, then you’ll need to decide how to handle being accountable for your actions or whether you’ll blame circumstances, your colleagues, or that old favorite, “The System”.
Sound familiar? It’s a painful scenario experienced by workers all around the world. But reviews shouldn’t be so binary. And they shouldn’t be dreaded, either. Accountability has somehow become a dirty word in our lexicon… a tool that’s wielded like a cudgel when it should instead be seen as being more like a warm blanket.
Because reviews can be hacked, just like any other system or process. Hating on reviews only displays a lack of imagination. And you’re better than that — I know it. Continue reading →

Guest Post: On Giving

by Jonathon Colman Posted on December 24, 2013 


Ed. Note: This post was anonymously written as part of Blog Secret Santa and I’m extremely grateful to the author for creating such a thoughtful post. There’s a list of all Secret Santa posts, including one written by me, on Santa’s list of 2013 gift posts.

On Giving.Photo © Shereen M

On Giving
I can still remember the first time I read The Gift of the Magi. Reading it today is one of my favorite holiday traditions.
My mother had brought home a special edition of the story book complete with a red velveteen slipcase and the title embossed in beautiful script letters on the cover. It sat on our coffee table for all of five minutes before I gave in to the allure of its gold-gilded pages.
I recall feeling the lump in my throat as I read about the main characters, a couple of modest means, Jim and Della, who sold their most prized possessions only to unknowingly buy each other gifts that they would both no longer be able to use.
In the end it didn’t matter. In the end, the act of giving the gifts was greater than the gifts themselves. Real life works this way too.
Just like the many others who’ve read the tale before me since it was first published over a hundred years ago, I was deeply moved. I may have even got a bit misty-eyed.
But look beyond the cosmic irony of Magi’s mechanics and you’ll see actions universally held as noble and good. Actions like thoughtful consideration for another person’s needs and desires, and sacrifice for the sake of someone else.
Stories like these resonate with something deep inside us, because we all want to give and receive that sort of gift. Continue reading →

I’m Joining the Content Strategy Team at Facebook

by Jonathon Colman Posted on July 8, 2013 



Life doesn’t slow down, so you’ve got to keep moving.Photo © Dave Morris

Life doesn’t slow down.
It keeps moving. It won’t wait for you to catch up. And it never gives you a chance to catch your breath.
In just the first half of this year, I completed my master’s degree in information management at the University of Washington, a two-year program that culminated in a massive content auditing capstone project. I spoke at eight events, presenting a total of 536 individual slides. One of my decks even went viral, attracting close to 300,000 views as well as a mention in The Huffington Post.
I wrote a handful of blog posts, including this hand-curated list of 200+ content strategy resources. I also guest-blogged, I mentored, I did informal pro bono consulting and Q&As with a number of organizations… but mostly I met people, and I listened, soaking up information and perspectives and new ideas.
Throughout all of that, I also worked a full-time job at REI as their Principal Experience Architect. I worked on a mix of information architecture projects, content strategy, and business analysis and planning. REI’s been incredibly forgiving of my disheveled appearance, my apparent lack of interest in shaving, my constant yawning and bad habit of falling asleep at my desk.
And that’s no small feat with a stand-up desk, let me tell you.
So it’s been a busy six months. But even so, I’m not truly weary… I’m energized. And since life doesn’t slow down, I’m going to speed up.
Transitions

Later this month, I’ll be joining the amazing Content Strategy team at Facebook down in Menlo Park, California. I’m blown away by their talent, their empathy, and the sheer scale of their accomplishments, not to mention the challenge set before them: iteratively crafting content experiences that will be used by over one billion people.

Information Endures: A Story About Stories

by Jonathon Colman Posted on April 24, 2013 



Ed. note: Each year, the UW Information School (where I’m a grad student) holds its annual Dean’s Club Dinner to thank its donors and board members for their gifts and service. This year, I’m emceeing the event along with fellow iSchool students Amanda Jasso (MLIS, 2013) and Amado Robancho (Informatics & HCDE, 2013).
As part of my duties, I was asked to speak about my life, what brought me to the iSchool, and how I hoped to use information to bring value to people. It turned out to be a bit wonky; keep in mind that I wrote this for information scientists. But it’s also part stand-up comedy, part nostalgia for 1980s tech, and part dreaming about the future.
I’m grateful to the iSchool for asking me to share my story.

Introduction

UW iSchool Dean’s Club Dinner.Photo © UW iSchool

Hello, I’m Jonathon Colman, a graduate student in the MSIM mid-career program. When I’m not at the iSchool, you can find me at REI headquarters down in Kent, where I serve as their Principal Experience Architect. And when I’m not in Kent, you can find me stuck in traffic on I-5 because I’m trying to get back up to the iSchool.
Now for those of you on Twitter, I’m @jcolman. I mention this because I’m sending out pre-scheduled tweets during the evening with links that are relevant to the subjects of our talks. You can also find them using the hashtag #DeansClub. There’s even a pre-scheduled tweet about pre-scheduled tweets… how meta!
Oh, yeah — and that’s a Thing now: pre-scheduled tweets. They’re perfect for that awkward moment when you just can’t seem to find the time necessary to write 140 characters about what you’re having for dinner… but still need everyone to know that you’re eating something.
…against all odds, all sense of scope, and against all our rational instincts, we love information.
But my point — and I do have one — is that information endures. Yes, even information on Twitter, as ephemeral as it may seem. We can still tell a story with just 140 characters. Certainly information’s been an enduring factor in my own life (and yours, too, I’d wager) and in a way, that endurance is what brings us together tonight. Continue reading →

Last month I had the honor of speaking at Ignite Seattle. My topic was How Introverts Can Survive in This Extroverted World. Shauna Causey and Monica Guzman encouraged me to pitch Ignite and Beth Buelow inspired me by expanding my understanding of introversion in our recent interview.
The great folks at Ignite Seattle just released this video of my talk:

Help Marcia walk again

by Jonathon Colman Posted on September 26, 2016 



Please donate or share from this YouCaring page to help Marcia Huhta walk again.

Marcia Huhta needs your help
You may not know my mother in law, Marcia Huhta, but on June 6th, Marcia’s life changed forever.
That’s the day that Marcia and her husband, Matti, survived a head-on car collision.
Marcia was rescued from the wrecked vehicle with the jaws of life and air-lifted to a hospital for life-saving spinal surgery. But months later, Marcia’s in a wheelchair and has limited movement and sensation below her neck.
Donate or share to help Marcia walk
That’s why my wife and I are raising money to help Marcia get the medical care she needs to walk again.
Please donate—but if you can’t, please SHARE THIS LINK: youcaring.com/marcia-huhta-654257
It’s not enough to just like or heart this—every share counts! Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn… fire up your MySpace again. YouCaring says that every share is worth about $37 on average, so if you can’t donate, please consider sharing this with your friends—and ask them to do the same!
About Marcia Huhta

Marcia and Matti Huhta dancing at their 50th wedding anniversary.

Marcia Huhta is a loving mother of five children, grandmother to three, and great-grandmother to another two. She’s a lector at All Hallows Church, which she attended daily. Marcia was also an officer in the local Finnish-American Heritage Society for years. She also worked as a nurse at the Villa Maria Nursing & Rehabilitation facility for over 3 decades. Marcia is adored by her family, patients, colleagues, and her local community.
But there’s more: Marcia loves to dance. Square dances, waltzes, foxtrots, lindy hops, charlestons… watch the video above of Marcia dancing a polka with Matti at her 50th wedding anniversary. She performed with the Revontulet Dancers, a non-profit Finnish dancing troupe in Massachusetts.
Marcia has rhythm on her feet, a rhapsody in each step, but more than that, she also has grace—a rare gift given to someone who gave so much to her family, her patients, her church, and her community.
How your donations help Marcia

Marcia and Matti Huhta need your help—please donate or share at YouCaring.

We’re asking you to give Marcia another gift: your donations. Marcia needs long-term care, the best treatments, and world-class physical therapy to walk again, to dance again, even to hold her great-grandchildren again. And these treatments are out of her and her husband’s financial reach.
Your donations will pay for expenses like:

Colossal medical bills that have spiralled out of her family’s control
Long-term care in a skilled nursing facility that provides physical and occupational therapy
Improved treatments and therapies focused on helping her build strength, reduce pain, and stay healthy
Technologies that connect her with family & friends, since she’s unable to leave the facility she’s in
Additional medical care, transport, consultants, treatments, and other needs

Please donate to support Marcia on YouCaring. Your donation goes directly to Marcia and Matti Huhta and you’ll only be charged a credit card transaction fee.
Let’s help Marcia walk again
Marcia Huhta’s life has changed forever, and we’re going to change it again—by getting her back on her feet.
We want to see her walk, we want to see her dance, we want to see her hold her great-grandchildren again… but we need your help.
Please donate now!

Wicked Ambiguity and User Experience

by Jonathon Colman Posted on May 21, 2015 


Following are the video, slides, description, and transcript for my keynote talk, Wicked Ambiguity. See the acknowledgments for more information about my sources, influences, and the people who helped me along the way.
Video

Slides
 
Description
Wicked Ambiguity and User Experience
How do you solve the world’s hardest problems? And how would you respond if they’re unsolvable? As user experience professionals, we’re focused on people who live and work in the here and now. We dive into research, define the problem, break down silos, and focus on people’s intent to create solutions.
But how does our UX work change when a project lasts not for one year, or even 10 years, but for 10,000 years or more? Enter the “Wicked Problem,” or situations with so much ambiguity, complexity, and interdependencies that—by definition—they can’t be solved.
Using real-world examples from NASA’s Voyager program, the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository, and other long-term UX efforts, we’ll talk about the challenges of creating solutions for people whom we’ll never know in our lifetimes. The ways we grapple with ambiguity give us a new perspective on our work and on what it means to build experiences that last.
Transcript
Introduction
Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells.
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
Let us go and make our visit. (source)
Welcome to Wicked Ambiguity, a journey through time and space spanning 2.8 trillion years and 1.2 quadrillion miles.
This talk isn’t about me or my work. It’s about you and why you matter.
I’m dedicating this talk not to J. Alfred Prufrock, but instead to Leonard Nimoy. While he’s best known for “Star Trek,” you may not know that Leonard was also the host of TV’s “In Search Of…,” in which he looked for answers to long-standing mysteries of the unknown.
And you know what? You do that, too. We’re all just nerds looking for answers—and Leonard helped make it safe for us to be geeks, to be introverts, and to be fascinated by the universe that surrounds us.
“We’re all stories in the end,” (source) after all, so I won’t say rest in peace, but rather, “Live long and prosper.”
About Our Journey

Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine.

I’m your host for the next hour while we boldly go through the vast reaches of time and space. I’ll make sure none of us gets lost and everyone makes it back. But fair warning: the people who return won’t be the same as the ones who leave.
Got somewhere else to be? No worries! You can get these slides now at bit.ly/raycats—don’t worry, I promise that’ll make more sense by the end. Note, you need to use all lower-case letters or the link won’t work.
Let’s start with a memory; most things in the past do.
Do you remember being a child and your parents telling you, “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine.” (source) But you really thought they were lying just to make you feel better because it was dark, you were scared, and you didn’t know what to expect?
Kind of like in this keynote? Well, then. “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine.”
It’s a story we tell to project confidence and security. But it’s a hard promise to make. We can’t even predict the location and movements of a single atom—let alone complex things like world events, the stock market, or whether it’ll be nice out on Thursday.
So maybe, just maybe, everything’s not going to be fine. What then?
This symbol is taken from one of the Pioneer satellites launched by NASA in the ‘60s. It was also used on Voyager, the furthest man-made object from the Earth, spinning from out of the blue and into the black.
Today we’ll talk about this symbol and what it means. We’ll also cover a lot of science and math, but almost no science fiction—even though the ideas we’re discussing are fantastical. But other than quotes from books and TV shows like “Doctor Who,” everything you’re about to see is real. It’s true. And it’s troubling.
Some of you will leave today saying “This talk has NOTHING to do with user experience!” Others will say, “This talk has EVERYTHING to do with user experience!”
Guess what? You’re both right. Continue reading →

Why You Should Go to Confab

by Jonathon Colman Posted on March 11, 2015 



Welcome to Confab Central: the content strategy conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. © Sean Tubridy/Brain Traffic (used with permission)

This post is nearly two years too late.
I should have written it back in 2013 after I attended Confab Central in Minneapolis for the first time. The conference had already been around for a few years and I thought that I was late to the game. I was worried that I’d come across like a real n00b, out of my league and behind in the conversation.
But it wasn’t like that at all. There were so many smart people there, good people, the kind of people where the conversation just keeps on flowing on its own. I learned so much, hugged so many folks, laughed so hard I spilled my coffee (again, my apologies to the Hyatt Regency). They were so open, so welcoming—it almost felt like coming home.
But now it’s 2015. I’ll be giving the opening keynote at Confab Central this year. So this post is late—I should have written it back in 2013 because now you won’t believe me when I tell you about Confab. You’ll say I’m biased.
So let me be clear about this: when it comes to Confab, I am biased. Extremely biased. Biased like your Aunt Suzy.
But I’m not biased because they’re paying me—I can’t accept any payment for speaking, so instead we’re making a donation to Girls Who Code, a great nonprofit with a mission I believe in.
Rather, I’m biased because the experience of attending Confab is just so amazing. And I want to share that bias with you openly, in plain sight, so that you can experience the same things I have.
Here’s why you should join me at Confab Central this year. Continue reading →

Secret Wars

by Jonathon Colman Posted on February 25, 2015

Cross-published on Medium.
In 1984—when they told us that the Soviets boycotting the Olympics in Los Angeles wasn’t such a big deal, really—Marvel Comics published Secret Wars. It was such an amazing comic book series… nothing like it had ever been done before. Heroes and villains from dozens of separate titles all duking it out together over the course of a year.
To my hungry, nine-year-old eyes, it was hard to tell who the heroes were because sometimes they turned out to be the villains. And some of the villains were really just misunderstood heroes. To me, it was the very peak of drama. Every panel was like a movie, each issue an epic.
What I didn’t understand at the time was the series’ political parallels: Ronald Reagan was running a secret war of his own, quietly selling arms to Iran to fund rebel forces in Nicaragua.
So I devoured each issue like an addict, flipping the pages at a staccato pace. And my addiction spread quickly—Secret Wars made me a comics fan for over a decade. And as I grew up, it lead me to bigger (and better) stories.
Stories like these three, which are about the real secret wars. They’re the dark battles that remain unspoken, lurking on the fringes and hiding in plain sight. They’re the conspiracies of silence caused by the things we can’t say.
Those are wars, too. We wage them with the people closest to us, but never admit to their existence… or to the damage they cause.
The things that hurt us the most are the ones we can’t speak of. They pull at us in the smallest, the most intimate of ways. They break us with their banality. Or sometimes they just break us.
Here are three stories from the front.  Continue reading →

How to Get One Million Views on SlideShare

by Jonathon Colman Posted on May 27, 2014 



One million views on SlideShare… and counting.Image © SlideShare

On the week of January 12, 2014, I cracked the one million views mark for my presentations on SlideShare. I’m now well on the road to two million.
I’m definitely not the first (or the only) one to reach this point. Many presentations have hundreds of thousands of views – a few even have millions. And since several publishers on SlideShare are quite prolific, there must be numerous accounts who have reached – and far surpassed – this sum.
Even so, I did a happy dance. Can you blame me? I was an early adopter of SlideShare; my first upload dates back to July 21, 2007. That’s nearly seven years’ worth of use. I started using SlideShare less than a year after posting my first tweet and first status update on Facebook.
You might be aware that there are benefits to being an early adopter of a nascent network. Even so, if you’ve ever seen me speak, then you know that a favorite topic of mine is my own non-exceptionalism. I can’t think of anything I’ve done that anyone else couldn’t do (or do better).
So I believe that with the right methods and approach, just about anyone can reach one million views on SlideShare. My goal is to help you do that.
Do great work that’s worthy of being shared
 
Out of all of my presentations, the above talk on core values is my favorite. It took me seven years of practice to create something of this level of quality. It may not be a big accomplishment to you; that’s okay – it was to me. And hopefully I can do much better work in the future.
While it should go without saying that we have to challenge ourselves to do the best we can, how would you explain why there are so many bad presentations being given so often? To understand, we have to start from a position of empathy; I think that the majority of bad talks aren’t given on purpose.
Most of the time, I think that speakers are in a rush, or haven’t prepared well, or are nervous, or are distracted, or don’t understand how to design slides, or don’t want to speak in the first place, or feel intimidated, or aren’t held accountable to give a good performance, or any number of other factors and challenges. I certainly know what all that feels like; I’ve given bad talks under circumstances just like these.
The good news is that all of these problems can be solved, all of these weaknesses can be improved upon.
Don’t believe me? Take a look at my first few presentations. I leave them online in my SlideShare account to remind me of how I started out – with no natural talent, design sense, or storytelling ability.
My recent talks look much better and have far more views and shares.
The rest of this post explains is an introduction to how I made that happen. Continue reading →

How to Hack Your Self-Review

by Jonathon Colman Posted on January 6, 2014 



Hack your review, hack yourself.Photo © johngineer

Once again, it’s time to write your annual self-review. Just like last year (and the year before), Review Season sneaked up on you when you weren’t looking.
Now you’ve landed on this page after raiding Google for tips and tricks, hoping to find some secret key or formula that will help you ace your written self-evaluation so that you can get back to… well, whatever it is you’re doing instead of preparing for your review.
No such luck. There’s no hidden back door, no algorithm to fool, no “one weird trick” to get around evaluating yourself and your actions.
If you were successful in your work this year, you’ll need to weigh the merits of touting that success versus coming off like a braggart. But if you failed to meet your goals, then you’ll need to decide how to handle being accountable for your actions or whether you’ll blame circumstances, your colleagues, or that old favorite, “The System”.
Sound familiar? It’s a painful scenario experienced by workers all around the world. But reviews shouldn’t be so binary. And they shouldn’t be dreaded, either. Accountability has somehow become a dirty word in our lexicon… a tool that’s wielded like a cudgel when it should instead be seen as being more like a warm blanket.
Because reviews can be hacked, just like any other system or process. Hating on reviews only displays a lack of imagination. And you’re better than that — I know it. Continue reading →

Guest Post: On Giving

by Jonathon Colman Posted on December 24, 2013 


Ed. Note: This post was anonymously written as part of Blog Secret Santa and I’m extremely grateful to the author for creating such a thoughtful post. There’s a list of all Secret Santa posts, including one written by me, on Santa’s list of 2013 gift posts.

On Giving.Photo © Shereen M

On Giving
I can still remember the first time I read The Gift of the Magi. Reading it today is one of my favorite holiday traditions.
My mother had brought home a special edition of the story book complete with a red velveteen slipcase and the title embossed in beautiful script letters on the cover. It sat on our coffee table for all of five minutes before I gave in to the allure of its gold-gilded pages.
I recall feeling the lump in my throat as I read about the main characters, a couple of modest means, Jim and Della, who sold their most prized possessions only to unknowingly buy each other gifts that they would both no longer be able to use.
In the end it didn’t matter. In the end, the act of giving the gifts was greater than the gifts themselves. Real life works this way too.
Just like the many others who’ve read the tale before me since it was first published over a hundred years ago, I was deeply moved. I may have even got a bit misty-eyed.
But look beyond the cosmic irony of Magi’s mechanics and you’ll see actions universally held as noble and good. Actions like thoughtful consideration for another person’s needs and desires, and sacrifice for the sake of someone else.
Stories like these resonate with something deep inside us, because we all want to give and receive that sort of gift. Continue reading →

I’m Joining the Content Strategy Team at Facebook

by Jonathon Colman Posted on July 8, 2013 



Life doesn’t slow down, so you’ve got to keep moving.Photo © Dave Morris

Life doesn’t slow down.
It keeps moving. It won’t wait for you to catch up. And it never gives you a chance to catch your breath.
In just the first half of this year, I completed my master’s degree in information management at the University of Washington, a two-year program that culminated in a massive content auditing capstone project. I spoke at eight events, presenting a total of 536 individual slides. One of my decks even went viral, attracting close to 300,000 views as well as a mention in The Huffington Post.
I wrote a handful of blog posts, including this hand-curated list of 200+ content strategy resources. I also guest-blogged, I mentored, I did informal pro bono consulting and Q&As with a number of organizations… but mostly I met people, and I listened, soaking up information and perspectives and new ideas.
Throughout all of that, I also worked a full-time job at REI as their Principal Experience Architect. I worked on a mix of information architecture projects, content strategy, and business analysis and planning. REI’s been incredibly forgiving of my disheveled appearance, my apparent lack of interest in shaving, my constant yawning and bad habit of falling asleep at my desk.
And that’s no small feat with a stand-up desk, let me tell you.
So it’s been a busy six months. But even so, I’m not truly weary… I’m energized. And since life doesn’t slow down, I’m going to speed up.
Transitions

Later this month, I’ll be joining the amazing Content Strategy team at Facebook down in Menlo Park, California. I’m blown away by their talent, their empathy, and the sheer scale of their accomplishments, not to mention the challenge set before them: iteratively crafting content experiences that will be used by over one billion people.

Information Endures: A Story About Stories

by Jonathon Colman Posted on April 24, 2013 



Ed. note: Each year, the UW Information School (where I’m a grad student) holds its annual Dean’s Club Dinner to thank its donors and board members for their gifts and service. This year, I’m emceeing the event along with fellow iSchool students Amanda Jasso (MLIS, 2013) and Amado Robancho (Informatics & HCDE, 2013).
As part of my duties, I was asked to speak about my life, what brought me to the iSchool, and how I hoped to use information to bring value to people. It turned out to be a bit wonky; keep in mind that I wrote this for information scientists. But it’s also part stand-up comedy, part nostalgia for 1980s tech, and part dreaming about the future.
I’m grateful to the iSchool for asking me to share my story.

Introduction

UW iSchool Dean’s Club Dinner.Photo © UW iSchool

Hello, I’m Jonathon Colman, a graduate student in the MSIM mid-career program. When I’m not at the iSchool, you can find me at REI headquarters down in Kent, where I serve as their Principal Experience Architect. And when I’m not in Kent, you can find me stuck in traffic on I-5 because I’m trying to get back up to the iSchool.
Now for those of you on Twitter, I’m @jcolman. I mention this because I’m sending out pre-scheduled tweets during the evening with links that are relevant to the subjects of our talks. You can also find them using the hashtag #DeansClub. There’s even a pre-scheduled tweet about pre-scheduled tweets… how meta!
Oh, yeah — and that’s a Thing now: pre-scheduled tweets. They’re perfect for that awkward moment when you just can’t seem to find the time necessary to write 140 characters about what you’re having for dinner… but still need everyone to know that you’re eating something.
…against all odds, all sense of scope, and against all our rational instincts, we love information.
But my point — and I do have one — is that information endures. Yes, even information on Twitter, as ephemeral as it may seem. We can still tell a story with just 140 characters. Certainly information’s been an enduring factor in my own life (and yours, too, I’d wager) and in a way, that endurance is what brings us together tonight. Continue reading →

Jonathan Coleman













                    
                    Jonathan Coleman is the author of five critically acclaimed books of narrative nonfiction, three of which were New York Times bestsellers.  His most recent, WEST BY WEST: My Charmed, Tormented Life--which the writer Gay Talese praised as “exceptional” and “powerful” and The New Yorker called “deeply thoughtful”--is a collaboration with the legendary Jerry West, the silhouetted figure of the NBA logo.  It was published by Little, Brown in 2011, was featured in Sports Illustrated, instantly became a New York Times bestseller, and was released in paperback in 2012.  It was named one of the best nonfiction books in 2011 by the Los Angeles Times and one of the two best nonfiction books of 2011 by the Institute for International Sport. All of the research and interviews related to this book are part of the Jerry West Collection at West Virginia University.  Mr. Coleman was recently the Nancy Schaenen Scholar at the Janet Prindle Institute for Ethics at DePauw University.          His previous book, LONG WAY TO GO: Black and White in America, has been called “a classic” (Morris Dees, Southern Poverty Law Center), “history and journalism at its best” (Andrew Hacker, author of Two Nations) and received front-page reviews in the New York Times Book Review, the Washington Post Book World, and the Chicago Tribune.  In addition, Mr. Coleman traveled throughout the country, taking part in symposiums that centered around the book and the subject of race, and he served as an adviser to President Clinton’s Initiative on Race as well as an adviser on racial unity to Bill Bradley’s presidential campaign.  (All of Mr. Coleman’s research and interviews related to Long Way to Go can be found at the Golda Meir Library of the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.)      Mr. Coleman was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Virginia with distinction.  He began his career in London, working for The New Review, a literary magazine.  He then came to New York and worked in book publishing, first at Alfred A. Knopf and later as a senior editor and the youngest editor ever appointed to the editorial board of Simon and Schuster.  Among the books he edited were Peter Taylor’s In the Miro District, Robert Lindsey’s The Falcon and the Snowman, Jeffrey Archer’s Kane and Abel, Don Imus’s God’s Other Son, David S. Broder’s Changing of the Guard, Elizabeth Drew’s Senator, William S. Cohen’s Roll Call,  Jonathan Raban’s Old Glory and Arabia, Shiva Naipaul’s North of South and Journey to Nowhere, Fred Kaplan’s The Wizards of Armageddon, Richard Norton Smith’s Thomas E. Dewey and His Times, and Donald Johanson’s Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind.  In a piece about publishing in Time magazine, he was profiled as one of the best editors in the field.     From publishing he moved to CBS News, where he worked as a producer and then as a  correspondent and where he initially began to investigate the story that led to his first book,  At Mother’s Request. Published in 1985, it was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection and made the New York Times bestseller list in both hardcover and paperback.  Favorably compared by the critics to such books as Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood and Norman Mailer’s The Executioner’s Song, it was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award and given a Special Citation.  (All of Coleman’s research related to At Mother’s Request is with the Marriott Library at the University of Utah.)  In 1987, a miniseries based on his book aired on CBS, and he made a cameo appearance.     In the fall of 1989, his second book, Exit the Rainmaker, was a featured selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and was praised by Time (“Striking”), The New York Times Book Review (“Fascinating”) and The Los Angeles Times Book Review (“A fascinating symbolic statement of the American psyche”).  In addition, he wrote a profile of Maya Lin, designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Civil Rights Memorial, for Time.  In 1990, when Exit the Rainmaker was published in paperback, it became a New York Times bestseller.     In 1991, Coleman wrote a piece on Little League that was subsequently cited for Special Mention in Best American Sports Writing 1992.  Over the years his articles have covered a  variety of subjects:  the world’s largest Polaroid camera; the water towers of Manhattan; the mysterious drowning of three black teenagers in Texas on Juneteenth; the way in which technology has made us “intimate strangers”; a small parking problem that John Grisham made a big deal over; profiles of Don Imus,  Jeff Sonnenfeld (which answers, among other things, the question of whether he vandalized the business school building at Emory in retaliation for not being offered the deanship), Rose Lavelle, and the U.S. Women’s National soccer team; remembrances of the director and composer Elizabeth Swados and of the Emile Griffith-Benny “Kid” Paret fight (the one in which Paret was killed), which he attended at the age of ten.        Mr. Coleman is a member of PEN and is included in Who’s Who in America, Who’s Who in American Education, and Contemporary Authors.  He has written for the New York Times (both the Magazine and Book Review), Newsweek, The New Yorker, New York Magazine, Sports Illustrated, the Washington Post (both Style and Book World), the Chicago Tribune, the Texas Observer, among other publications.  He taught advanced creative nonfiction writing at the University of Virginia for many years, and has lectured at Princeton, Penn, Columbia, and a number of other universities as well as at Chautauqua, the Civil Rights Institute in Birmingham, the 92nd St. Y, the Auburn Avenue Research Library in Atlanta, the Milwaukee Public Library, the Tennessee Williams Literary Festival, Writers at Work, the Miami Book Fair, the Nebraska Summer Writers’ Conference, the Virginia Festival of the Book, and Semester at Sea.  Over the course of his career, he has been interviewed on most of the major television and radio shows, including Today, Oprah, Larry King Live, Good Morning America, Vanished, 48 Hours, All Things Considered, Inside Edition, Court TV’s Power, Privilege and Justice, and has been profiled in nearly every major newspaper.  In addition, he narrates documentaries—for which he has won three awards—and audiobooks, and does other forms of voiceover work.         Mr. Coleman has just returned to New York City to live (and is in the midst of writing a piece about it, reflecting on the various ways he feels the city—and he—has changed, or not).  He is currently finishing a book about Angus Cameron, the renowned book editor (and “true Renaissance man”) who was blacklisted in the 1950s, a book that draws on their relationship of more than twenty-five years:  What He Stood For:  The Courage and Many Worlds of Angus Cameron.  145 E. 22nd St., Apt.4HNew York, NY 10010jonacoles@aol.com@jonacoles347-285-1418

Career[edit]
Television and radio[edit]
Coleman's broadcasting career started in the late 1970s in Australia when he was chosen a member of the reporting team for the popular afternoon children's TV magazine show Simon Townsend's Wonder World, created and hosted by journalist Simon Townsend.
This was followed by several years as a DJ and presenter on the ABC's youth radio network Triple J, including a stint as co-host (with Ian Rogerson) on the popular Sunday afternoon comedy program Off The Record, a program that featured the talents of comedy group The J-Team, which included comedians Lance Curtis, Adam Bowen and Angela Webber.
In 1983 Coleman starred in the Australian movie Midnite Spares alongside well known Australian actors Max Cullen and Gia Carides.
In 1984 Jono and Dano moved to triple m where they took the show to the number 1 position.
In 1988 Jonathan Coleman and Ian 'Dano' Rogerson began hosting a new music television programme on The Seven Network. Saturday Morning Live was broadcast from Sydney, nationally from 9 am to 12:30 pm every Saturday morning. The programme was a mixture of music videos, live performances, interviews with musicians and performers, location items and comedy performances (usually in character by Jono & Dano). The show was immediately popular and soon became the most watched music programme on Australian television.[1]
For the second season of Saturday Morning Live in 1989 the producers decided to expand on the comedy aspect and introduced a cast of comedic performers to work alongside Coleman and Rogerson. The new format was not successful and in mid-1989 the comedy component was dropped and the emphasis on music (in particular live performances) was re-established. To appeal to a younger demographic two young actors from the Seven Network teen drama Home and Away were recruited onto the show. Emily Symons and Mat Stevenson co-hosted the new Saturday Morning Live as well as presenting occasional location reports.
Just as the programme was re-establishing its audience and the ratings were improving the Seven Network suddenly axed Saturday Morning Live in December 1989. This would be the last time Jono & Dano worked together as a double act on television.
In 1992, Coleman worked as an announcer and sidekick on the Lifetime game show Born Lucky hosted by former one-time Wheel of Fortune host and Entertainment Tonight reporter Bob Goen.
Coleman also appeared in the British television programmes, BBC's Food and Drink, Noel's House Party on ITV, BSkyB's Swing Shift, Hit the Road on BBC, Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrities Under Pressure, I'm Famous and Frightened! and Have I Been Here Before?, and he provides the voice of the narrator for the children's show The Koala Brothers.
In 1996, Coleman appeared in an episode of the ITV sitcom Is It Legal? as a DJ on the fictional station Hounslow FM.
UK radio[edit]
Coleman's UK radio career began at BBC GLR in 1990, before moving to Virgin Radio in May 1993, presenting the Sunday – Thursday evening show from 7–10pm. In July 1993, he co-presented the breakfast show alongside Russ Williams, where he remained until October 1997, moving to the drivetime show upon Chris Evans' arrival at the station.
Coleman was fired from Virgin Radio in early 1998 and moved to London's Heart 106.2, presenting the breakfast show. He co-hosted the show with Harriet Scott from mid-2002.
In early 2005, despite his breakfast show contributing to Heart 106.2 becoming the most listened to commercial radio station in London, he was axed, moving to sister station LBC 97.3, where for a short time he took over the weekend mid-morning show from 10 am – 1 pm.
On 25 July 2005 Coleman took over the 3–5pm Afternoon show on BBC London 94.9 and from 17 October 2005, he took over the breakfast show from Danny Baker, co-presenting with JoAnne Good. In late 2006, he had left BBC London and the UK to be near his 81-year-old mother Sylvia, in Sydney, Australia.[2]
Return to Australia[edit]
Jono is currently working at Network Ten onscreen presenting news and entertainment reports.
Since returning to Australia, Coleman hosted the drive time radio slot 4–7pm across Australia on the "Classic Hits' network (part of Australian Radio Network) and regional stations from 2007 to 2011. The show was initially known as The Jonathan Coleman Experience", a show he hosted with "RocKwiz" presenter, Julia Zemiro. Then in 2009, he reunited with Rogerson and presented "The Jono & Dano Show" taking the show to the number 2 drive time slot on FM radio in Sydney and Melbourne.
Coleman also became a regular reporter for Channel Seven's morning news program Sunrise, for which he had previously appeared presenting entertainment news from London. His regular segment was reviewing movies. He has also presented entertainment news for Mornings with Kerri-Anne on the Nine Network.
Coleman appears regularly for many international television crossovers from the United Kingdom for Australian television. Coleman also wrote for Punch magazine titled Coleman's Bowls, the national newspaper Daily Star, OK Magazine and The Evening Standard.
Coleman has also provided many voice-overs and narrations for many products both in Australia and internationally for companies such as Tooheys, Foster's, Qantas, the Australian Tourist Commission, and BBC TV, as well as in-flight programs for Qantas, Air New Zealand and Britannia.
Jonathan Coleman was also the voice of the award-winning Australian 70s and 80s music radio program "My Generation" from 2004 to 2010, heard on the Australian Radio Network stations Gold 104 (Melbourne), WS-FM (Sydney), 4KQ (Brisbane), Mix 102.3 FM (Adelaide), Mix 106.3 FM (Canberra), and more than 100 other radio stations throughout Australia.
In 2007, he filmed a cameo for long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours, which he was one of the witnesses at Karl and Susan Kennedy's wedding.
Coleman is currently presenting advertorials on Network Ten morning TV program Studio 10. He is also the voiceover for the program[3]
Suspension from Sunrise[edit]
On 2 August 2007, Coleman was suspended indefinitely from Sunrise for revealing the supposed end to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on air. He later said that he had not read the book and the Seven Network released a statement regarding his actions.[4] Sunrise announced that their viewers would decide whether he would be fired.[5] He kept his job with 70% of the vote.
Personal life[edit]
Coleman lived in North London from 1990 until his return to Australia in 2006. He now resides in Sydney, and is married with two children.

Career[edit]
Television and radio[edit]
Coleman's broadcasting career started in the late 1970s in Australia when he was chosen a member of the reporting team for the popular afternoon children's TV magazine show Simon Townsend's Wonder World, created and hosted by journalist Simon Townsend.
This was followed by several years as a DJ and presenter on the ABC's youth radio network Triple J, including a stint as co-host (with Ian Rogerson) on the popular Sunday afternoon comedy program Off The Record, a program that featured the talents of comedy group The J-Team, which included comedians Lance Curtis, Adam Bowen and Angela Webber.
In 1983 Coleman starred in the Australian movie Midnite Spares alongside well known Australian actors Max Cullen and Gia Carides.
In 1984 Jono and Dano moved to triple m where they took the show to the number 1 position.
In 1988 Jonathan Coleman and Ian 'Dano' Rogerson began hosting a new music television programme on The Seven Network. Saturday Morning Live was broadcast from Sydney, nationally from 9 am to 12:30 pm every Saturday morning. The programme was a mixture of music videos, live performances, interviews with musicians and performers, location items and comedy performances (usually in character by Jono & Dano). The show was immediately popular and soon became the most watched music programme on Australian television.[1]
For the second season of Saturday Morning Live in 1989 the producers decided to expand on the comedy aspect and introduced a cast of comedic performers to work alongside Coleman and Rogerson. The new format was not successful and in mid-1989 the comedy component was dropped and the emphasis on music (in particular live performances) was re-established. To appeal to a younger demographic two young actors from the Seven Network teen drama Home and Away were recruited onto the show. Emily Symons and Mat Stevenson co-hosted the new Saturday Morning Live as well as presenting occasional location reports.
Just as the programme was re-establishing its audience and the ratings were improving the Seven Network suddenly axed Saturday Morning Live in December 1989. This would be the last time Jono & Dano worked together as a double act on television.
In 1992, Coleman worked as an announcer and sidekick on the Lifetime game show Born Lucky hosted by former one-time Wheel of Fortune host and Entertainment Tonight reporter Bob Goen.
Coleman also appeared in the British television programmes, BBC's Food and Drink, Noel's House Party on ITV, BSkyB's Swing Shift, Hit the Road on BBC, Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrities Under Pressure, I'm Famous and Frightened! and Have I Been Here Before?, and he provides the voice of the narrator for the children's show The Koala Brothers.
In 1996, Coleman appeared in an episode of the ITV sitcom Is It Legal? as a DJ on the fictional station Hounslow FM.
UK radio[edit]
Coleman's UK radio career began at BBC GLR in 1990, before moving to Virgin Radio in May 1993, presenting the Sunday – Thursday evening show from 7–10pm. In July 1993, he co-presented the breakfast show alongside Russ Williams, where he remained until October 1997, moving to the drivetime show upon Chris Evans' arrival at the station.
Coleman was fired from Virgin Radio in early 1998 and moved to London's Heart 106.2, presenting the breakfast show. He co-hosted the show with Harriet Scott from mid-2002.
In early 2005, despite his breakfast show contributing to Heart 106.2 becoming the most listened to commercial radio station in London, he was axed, moving to sister station LBC 97.3, where for a short time he took over the weekend mid-morning show from 10 am – 1 pm.
On 25 July 2005 Coleman took over the 3–5pm Afternoon show on BBC London 94.9 and from 17 October 2005, he took over the breakfast show from Danny Baker, co-presenting with JoAnne Good. In late 2006, he had left BBC London and the UK to be near his 81-year-old mother Sylvia, in Sydney, Australia.[2]
Return to Australia[edit]
Jono is currently working at Network Ten onscreen presenting news and entertainment reports.
Since returning to Australia, Coleman hosted the drive time radio slot 4–7pm across Australia on the "Classic Hits' network (part of Australian Radio Network) and regional stations from 2007 to 2011. The show was initially known as The Jonathan Coleman Experience", a show he hosted with "RocKwiz" presenter, Julia Zemiro. Then in 2009, he reunited with Rogerson and presented "The Jono & Dano Show" taking the show to the number 2 drive time slot on FM radio in Sydney and Melbourne.
Coleman also became a regular reporter for Channel Seven's morning news program Sunrise, for which he had previously appeared presenting entertainment news from London. His regular segment was reviewing movies. He has also presented entertainment news for Mornings with Kerri-Anne on the Nine Network.
Coleman appears regularly for many international television crossovers from the United Kingdom for Australian television. Coleman also wrote for Punch magazine titled Coleman's Bowls, the national newspaper Daily Star, OK Magazine and The Evening Standard.
Coleman has also provided many voice-overs and narrations for many products both in Australia and internationally for companies such as Tooheys, Foster's, Qantas, the Australian Tourist Commission, and BBC TV, as well as in-flight programs for Qantas, Air New Zealand and Britannia.
Jonathan Coleman was also the voice of the award-winning Australian 70s and 80s music radio program "My Generation" from 2004 to 2010, heard on the Australian Radio Network stations Gold 104 (Melbourne), WS-FM (Sydney), 4KQ (Brisbane), Mix 102.3 FM (Adelaide), Mix 106.3 FM (Canberra), and more than 100 other radio stations throughout Australia.
In 2007, he filmed a cameo for long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours, which he was one of the witnesses at Karl and Susan Kennedy's wedding.
Coleman is currently presenting advertorials on Network Ten morning TV program Studio 10. He is also the voiceover for the program[3]
Suspension from Sunrise[edit]
On 2 August 2007, Coleman was suspended indefinitely from Sunrise for revealing the supposed end to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on air. He later said that he had not read the book and the Seven Network released a statement regarding his actions.[4] Sunrise announced that their viewers would decide whether he would be fired.[5] He kept his job with 70% of the vote.
Personal life[edit]
Coleman lived in North London from 1990 until his return to Australia in 2006. He now resides in Sydney, and is married with two children.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them. And if you ever want a place to discuss your passions, your knowledge, or your warnings about products, our forum is one of the more comprehensive places to do it.

So don’t take our word for it, check it out for yourself and see everything eReplacementParts.com has to offer.

						What Our Loyal Customers Have To Say					

						Just a short note to say thanks for the information and parts you provide. I have been able to resurrect and maintain a wide variety of tools thanks to the schematics and amazing array of parts you can supply.					

						Chris D.					

						Maryland, USA					


					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
