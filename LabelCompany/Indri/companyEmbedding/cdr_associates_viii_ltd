Overview

			Based in New York and London, CD&R’s professionals reflect two different skill
			sets: our financial partners are experienced private equity investment professionals from 
			the world’s premier financial institutions and management advisory firms, whereas 
			our operating partners have collectively spent more than 300 years in senior management
			positions across a wide range of industry sectors at over 50 companies, notably ABB, BBA, BTR, Emerson Electric, GE, IBM and Unilever. 
			

            Operating Partners have 
            collectively spent more 
            than 300 years in 
            Senior Management positions
          
			Our Operating Partners participate in every phase of the investment process. They work closely with CD&R’s financial investment professionals on sourcing and due diligence, offering insights about the specific opportunities to boost productivity, innovation, product quality, revenue growth and profits. Together with the Financial Partners, they make judgments about strategy, senior leadership, human resource management systems, and practices in a wide variety of business functions. Operating Partners assume a particularly important role driving the post-acquisition business plan, management oversight, organizational effectiveness and value-building initiatives at portfolio companies. An Operating Partner or Operating Advisor serves as chairman, chairman of the executive committee, or lead director for each of the Firm’s portfolio companies.
						
			Financial partners focus on sourcing, financing or exiting investments, which includes developing relationships and a pipeline of investment ideas from intermediaries and corporate management teams and board members, originating new investment opportunities, conducting comprehensive due diligence on potential investments, structuring and financing new acquisitions and managing exit processes. They also work closely with Operating Partners and Operating Advisors on key strategic and operational initiatives at our portfolio companies.
			
			CD&R functions as a true partnership with a clear sense of shared purpose. Each Partner has different strengths and competencies, but all play important roles in sourcing transactions, conducting due diligence, making investment decisions and managing portfolio companies.
			

			From time to time in this website, reference is made to the “partners”, “financial partners” and “operating partners” of CD&R. These terms are used because they reflect the way in which the senior professionals of CD&R refer to themselves internally. Technically, however, such individuals are not “partners” of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, which is a limited liability company. They instead are officers, employees, limited partners or members of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and its affiliates.
