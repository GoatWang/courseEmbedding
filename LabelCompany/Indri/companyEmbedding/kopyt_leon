NO. 1 TO LEON KOPYT'S
SEVERANCE AGREEMENT
 
THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO LEON KOPYT'S SEVERANCE AGREEMENT
(the "mendment") is entered into as of
December 12, 2007, by and between RCM Technologies, Inc. (the
"Company") and
Leon Kopyt ("Employee").
WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee previously entered into
a
Severance Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2002 (the "Severance
Agreement");
WHEREAS, in order to comply with the requirements of section
409A of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
Company desires
to amend the Severance Agreement; and
WHEREAS, Employee has agreed to the changes to the Severance
Agreement
to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound,
hereby agree that the Severance Agreement is hereby amended as
follows:
1. A new subsection 1.b. is hereby added to the Severance
Agreement to read in
its entirety as follows, and the remainder of Section 1 is
renumbered
accordingly:
"b. `Code' shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended."
2. Subsection 2.b. of the Severance Agreement is hereby amended
in its entirety
to read as follows:
"b. Within five (5) days following Employee's termination of
employment, but subject to subsection 2.g. below, a lump sum
cash payment which is equal to one-sixth (1/6) of the
aggregate of Employee's then-current gross annual salary
(for
federal income tax purposes) and ascertainable bonus (i.e.
the
maximum bonus that Employee was eligible to receive during
the
Company's most recently completed fiscal year) multiplied by
the number of years or partial years that Employee has been
employed by the Company;"
3. Subsection 2.c. of the Severance Agreement is hereby amended
in its entirety
to read as follows:
"c. For a period of three (3) years following Employee's
termination of employment, Employee shall receive and, where
applicable, his spouse and dependents shall receive medical
insurance coverage that is equivalent to the coverage that
Employee would have been eligible to receive if Employee
continued in employment during such period; provided, that
in
order to receive such continued coverage, Employee shall be
required to pay to the Company at the same time that premium
payments are due for the month an amount equal to the full
monthly premium payments required for such coverage and the
Company shall reimburse to Employee the amount of such
monthly
premium, less the amount that Employee was required to pay
for
such coverage immediately prior to the date of his
termination
of employment (the `Medical Payment'), no later than five
(5)
days following the date the premium for the month is paid by
Employee. In addition, on each date on which the Medical
Payments are made, but subject to subsection 2.g. below, the
Company shall pay to Employee an additional amount equal to
the federal, state and local income and payroll taxes that
Employee incurs on each monthly Medical Payment (the
`Medical
Gross-up Payment'). The Medical Payment paid to Employee
during the period of time during which Employee would be
entitled to continuation coverage under the Company's group
health plan pursuant to section 4980B of the Code (or any
replacement or successor provision of the United States tax
law) if Employee elected such coverage and paid the
applicable
premiums is intended to qualify for the exception from
deferred compensation as a medical benefit provided in
accordance with the requirements of Treas. Reg.
ss.1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(B). The Medical Payment and the Medical
Gross-up Payment shall be reimbursed to Employee in a manner
that complies with the requirements of Treas. Reg.
ss.1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv);"
4. A new subsection 2.d. is hereby added to the Severance
Agreement to read in
its entirety as follows, and the remainder of Section 2 is
renumbered
accordingly:
"d. Within five (5) days following Employee's termination of
employment, but subject to subsection 2.g. below, the
Company
shall pay Employee a lump sum cash payment equal to the
aggregate value of continuing Employee's life and disability
coverage, long term care insurance and automobile lease in
effect immediately prior to Employee's termination of
employment
for the three (3)-year period following Employee's
termination
of employment as if Employee continued to be employed by the
Company for such three (3)-year period. In addition, subject
to
subsection 2.g. below, the Company shall pay to Employee an
additional amount equal to the federal, state and local
income
and payroll taxes that Employee incurs on the lump sum cash
payment for the cost of continuing of all of the
abovementioned
benefits pursuant to this Section 2.d.;"
5. A new subsection 2.e., as renumbered, is hereby added to the
Severance
Agreement to read in its entirety as follows, and the remainder
of Section 2 is
renumbered accordingly:
"e. Within five (5) days following Employee's termination of
employment, but subject to subsection 2.g. below, the
Company
shall pay Employee a lump sum cash payment equal to the
aggregate value of continuing all employee benefits (other
than
those in subsections 2.c. and d.) provided to Employee
immediately prior to his termination of employment for the
three
(3)-year period following Employee's termination of
employment
as if Employee continued to be employed by the Company for
such
three (3)-year period. In addition, subject to subsection
2.g.
below, the Company shall pay to Employee an additional
amount
equal to the federal, state and local income and payroll
taxes
that Employee incurs on the lump sum cash payment for the
cost
of continuing all employee benefits pursuant to this Section
2.e.;"
6. A new subsection 2.g., as renumbered, is hereby added to the
Severance
Agreement to read in its entirety as follows:
"g. i. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement, if Employee is deemed at the time of his
termination of employment to be a `key employee' within the
meaning of that term under Code section 416(i) (as used for
purposes of defining a "specified employee" under section
409A
of the Code) and delayed payment of an amount that is
payable
to or on behalf of Employee in connection with a termination
of employment is required in order to avoid a prohibited
distribution under section 409A(a)(2) of the Code, no such
amount shall be provided to or paid on behalf of Employee
prior to the earlier of (x) the expiration of the six
(6)-month period measured from the date of Employee's
`separation from service' (as such term is defined in
Treasury
Regulations issued under Code section 409A) or (y) the date
of
Employee's death; provided, however, that upon the
expiration
of the applicable Code section 409A(a)(2) postponement
period
referred to herein, all amounts delayed pursuant to this
subsection 2.g., with accrued interest as described below,
shall be paid in a lump sum payment to or on behalf of
Employee within five (5) days after the end of the
postponement period. The
