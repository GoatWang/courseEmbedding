Research Interests
Dr. Michael F. Crowley is a principal scientist in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's
                  (NREL's) Biosciences Center, having joined the laboratory in 2007 to develop a simulation
                  and theory team. He leads the theory, modeling, and simulation efforts for biofuels
                  research. He is the principal investigator for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's)
                  Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) project "Biochemical Process Modeling and Simulation,"
                  in which enzyme digestion, metabolic modeling, and reactor and process design are
                  the main thrusts. He is co-principal investigator and leads the modeling thrust of
                  C3Bio, the Energy Frontier Research Center, in which NREL is a partner with Purdue,
                  and multiple other collaborative projects in biofuels and computational chemistry
                  research. He and his team maintain a level of productivity that produces on the order
                  of 15 peer-reviewed articles a year and as many presentations, and they are regarded
                  internationally as arguably the most productive and authoritative center for biofuel
                  and biomass simulation and theory.
               
Crowley is a developer of both CHARMM and Amber molecular dynamics software for biological
                  macromolecular simulation and has contributed significant advances to highly parallel,
                  high-performance scientific software for use on supercomputers. Until recently his
                  team included Antti-Pekka Hynninen, who is pushing the frontier of scientific simulation
                  using the most up-to-date computer hardware available in preparation for future computer
                  architectures. Crowlely's group has designed and implemented new methods and algorithms
                  specifically for biomass and biofuel-related questions.
               
An author on more than 130 peer-reviewed scientific articles, Crowley has given more
                  than 200 presentations, more than 50 of those being by invitation.
               
Crowley received his B.S. in chemistry from Fordham University, and his M.S. and Ph.D.
                  in physical chemistry from the University of Montana, with a short period of study
                  at the University of Alberta. His postdoctoral fellowship was at Brandeis University
                  with Dr. Irving Epstein. His doctoral and post-doctoral research was studying coupled
                  chemical oscillators and coupled nonlinear differential equations, and it was the
                  only study to date of nonforced coupled chemical reactions showing synchronization,
                  locking, and chaotic behaviors. In his time as assistant professor at Penn State University,
                  Crowley moved to studies of semiconductor surfaces. At West Virginia University, he
                  applied the nonlinear dynamical theories to controlling chaos in chemical oscillators
                  and flame fronts. In addition, at Carnegie Mellon University and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
                  Center, and at The Scripps Research Institute with David Case and Charles Brooks,
                  Crowley developed highly parallel methods for simulations of bio-macromolecules.

Areas of Expertise
Biomass Degrading Enzyme Biophysics and Design
Cellulases and other biomass-active enzymes are used in the industrial conversion
                  of biomass to its components for further upgrading to fuels and products. Research
                  on these enzymes is focused on determining the mechanism of action, thermodynamics,
                  and barriers in the enzymatic digestion of plant cell walls. Using molecular mechanics
                  and dynamics with advanced sampling methods, Crowley and his team determine free energies
                  such as binding of substrates, conformational changes, reaction profiles, and barriers,
                  with the aim of gaining basic understanding of how the enzymes work and how they can
                  be engineered to work more efficiently for better fuel production. The team has had
                  successes with many cellulases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, uncovering
                  the mechanisms of their CBMs, linkers, active sites, and binding sites, and predicting
                  mutational changes for better performance.
               






Cellulose Binding Domain is thermodynamically more stable on the top, hydrophobic
                        face of cellulose.
                     








Product (blue) binding in a Family 48 Cellobiohydrolase is bound in the pocket by
                        amino acids (yellow), which are present all the way until their product is expelled.
                     


Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Other Plant Cell Wall Materials
Cellulose is the most plentiful biopolymer on Earth. The research of Crowley and his
                  team discovers the intricacies of cell-wall polymer structure and function and their
                  interactions to form cell wall architecture. The aim has traditionally been to understand
                  the substrate of the enzymes studied in order to improve both the enzymes and the
                  pretreatment methods, with the long-term goal of possibly changing the cellulose that
                  has been produced by plants. The team is expanding research to study material properties.
                  Strong publications in cellulose structure including force field analysis, polymorph
                  studies, decrystallization thermodynamics, and structural understanding such as how
                  twist occurs in cellulose are being published. The team's efforts are also directed
                  toward understanding the production of cell wall materials through synthase, transferase,
                  and assembly modeling and simulation.

Cellulose fibril twist studied to determine source of twisting in hydrogen bonding
                  patterns. This modeling will help to understand the interactions that are important
                  in cell walls and in breaking them down to component sugars to be upgraded to fuels.
               
Cellulosomes
In BESC, the computational modeling has centered on the mechanisms of recalcitrance
                  and bacterial conversion of cell wall material. One of the most fascinating and effective
                  mechanisms found in bacteria is the cellulosome approach in which anywhere from a
                  few to tens of enzymes and other cell-wall-active components are assembled on scaffolds,
                  which may be tethered to the bacterium bind and act on plant cell walls to depolymerize
                  cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin to oligomers that can be upgraded within the
                  bacterial cell.

                        scaffold interacting with three coarse-grain cellulose fibrils. The cellulosome and
                        its enzyme components have many cellulose-binding domains that result in the binding
                        behavior viewed here.

Sugar Upgrading Enzyme Biophysics and Design
In the Biochemical Platform of the BETO, Crowley leads the Biochemical Process Modeling
                  and Simulation Project, which partners with experimental approaches to producing fuels
                  and high-value products from sugars and lignin. The modeling is directed at bottlenecks
                  in the molecular and metabolic processes involved in transport and upgrading. This
                  includes enzyme design for selectivity, activity, pH and temperature optimization,
                  and prediction of mutations and heterologous pathway design.
               

Thioesterase is a key enzyme in producing fatty acids from sugars in the pathway from
                  sugars to diesel and aviation fuels by microbes.
               
Molecular Dynamics and Simulation Code Development
CHARMM and Amber code development is an integral part of Crowley's work. He has been
                  a developer of Amber and CHARMM since 1995 and has contributed to the high-performance
                  aspects of both and he has led efforts to modernize them. The development of the fast
                  DOMDEC code in CHARMM was led by Crowley through the heroic efforts of Antti-Pekka
                  Hynninen at NREL and has brought CHARMM to the level of performance of other high-performing
                  codes carrying with it the vast and unparalleled scientific functionality and the
                  introduction of parallel GPU implementations. This work continues with new methods
                  of sampling that harness the immense computational power of the leadership-class machines
                  in DOE and the XSEDE centers.

Efficient estimation of the maximum metabolic productivity of batch systems



St. John, Peter C.
						; Crowley, Michael F.
						; Bomble, Yannick J.
JanuaryÂ 2017 - Biotechnology for Biofuels


Production of chemicals from engineered organisms in a batch culture involves an inherent trade-off between productivity, yield, and titer. Existing strategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that achieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability. While these methods are computationally tractable, an optimum productivity could be achieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources is permitted to change with time. New methods for the design and implementation of dynamic microbial processes, both computational and experimental, have therefore been explored to maximize productivity. However, solving for the optimal metabolic behavior under the assumptionmoreÂ Â» that all fluxes in the cell are free to vary is a challenging numerical task. Here, previous studies have therefore typically focused on simpler strategies that are more feasible to implement in practice, such as the time-dependent control of a single flux or control variable.Â«Â less

Coupling and Reactions of 5-Hydroxyconiferyl Alcohol in Lignin Formation



Elder, Thomas
						; Berstis, Laura
						; Beckham, Gregg T.
						; ... MayÂ 2016 - Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry


The catechol alcohols, caffeyl and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, may be incorporated into lignin either naturally or through genetic manipulation. Due to the presence of o-OH groups, these compounds form benzodioxanes, a departure from the interunit connections found in lignins derived from the cinnamyl alcohols. In nature, lignins composed of caffeyl and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol are linear homopolymers and, as such, may have properties that make them amenable for use in value-added products, such as lignin-based carbon fibers. In the current work, results from density functional theory calculations for the reactions of 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, taking stereochemistry into account, are reported. Dehydrogenation and quinone methide formation are found to be thermodynamically favored for 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, over coniferyl alcohol. The comparative energetics of the rearomatization reactions suggest that the formation of the benzodioxane linkage is under kinetic control. Ring-opening reactions of the benzodioxane groups show that the bond dissociation enthalpy of themoreÂ Â» $$\alpha$$-O cleavage reaction is lower than that of the $$\beta$$-O reaction. In conclusion, the catechol lignins represent a novel form of the polymer that may offer new opportunities for bioproducts and genetic targets.Â«Â less

Simulations of cellulose translocation in the bacterial cellulose synthase suggest a regulatory mechanism for the dimeric structure of cellulose



Knott, Brandon C.
						; Crowley, Michael F.
						; Himmel, Michael E.
						; ... JanuaryÂ 2016 - Chemical Science


The processive cycle of the bacterial cellulose synthase (Bcs) includes the addition of a single glucose moiety to the end of a growing cellulose chain followed by the translocation of the nascent chain across the plasma membrane. The mechanism of this translocation and its precise location within the processive cycle are not well understood. In particular, the molecular details of how a polymer (cellulose) whose basic structural unit is a dimer (cellobiose) can be constructed by adding one monomer (glucose) at a time are yet to be elucidated. Here, we have utilized molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations tomoreÂ Â» the shed light on these questions. We find that translocation forward by one glucose unit is quite favorable energetically, giving a free energy stabilization of greater than 10 kcal mol-1. In addition, there is only a small barrier to translocation, implying that translocation is not rate limiting within the Bcs processive cycle (given experimental rates for cellulose synthesis in vitro). Perhaps most significantly, our results also indicate that steric constraints at the transmembrane tunnel entrance regulate the dimeric structure of cellulose. Namely, when a glucose molecule is added to the cellulose chain in the same orientation as the acceptor glucose, the terminal glucose freely rotates upon forward motion, thus suggesting a regulatory mechanism for the dimeric structure of cellulose. We characterize both the conserved and non-conserved enzyme-polysaccharide interactions that drive translocation, and find that 20 of the 25 residues that strongly interact with the translocating cellulose chain in the simulations are well conserved, mostly with polar or aromatic side chains. Our results also allow for a dynamical analysis of the role of the so-called 'finger helix' in cellulose translocation that has been observed structurally. Taken together, these findings aid in the elucidation of the translocation steps of the Bcs processive cycle and may be widely relevant to polysaccharide synthesizing or degrading enzymes that couple catalysis with chain translocation.Â«Â less

Who's on base? Revealing the catalytic mechanism of inverting family 6 glycoside hydrolases



Mayes, Heather B.
						; Knott, Brandon C.
						; Crowley, Michael F.
						; ... JuneÂ 2016 - Chemical Science


In several important classes of inverting carbohydrate-active enzymes, the identity of the catalytic base remains elusive, including in family 6 Glycoside Hydrolase (GH6) enzymes, which are key components of cellulase cocktails for cellulose depolymerization. Despite many structural and kinetic studies with both wild-type and mutant enzymes, especially on the Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) GH6 cellulase (TrCel6A), the catalytic base in the single displacement inverting mechanism has not been definitively identified in the GH6 family. Here, we employ transition path sampling to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, which provides unbiased atomic-level understanding of key order parameters involved in cleaving themoreÂ Â» strong glycosidic bond. Our hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations reveal a network of hydrogen bonding that aligns two active site water molecules that play key roles in hydrolysis: one water molecule drives the reaction by nucleophilic attack on the substrate and a second shuttles a proton to the putative base (D175) via a short water wire. We also investigated the case where the putative base is mutated to an alanine, an enzyme that is experimentally still partially active. The simulations predict that proton hopping along a water wire via a Grotthuss mechanism provides a mechanism of catalytic rescue. Further simulations reveal that substrate processive motion is 'driven' by strong electrostatic interactions with the protein at the product sites and that the -1 sugar adopts a 2SO ring configuration as it reaches its binding site. Lastly, this work thus elucidates previously elusive steps in the processive catalytic mechanism of this important class of enzymes.Â«Â less

Comparing residue clusters from thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes reveals adaptive mechanisms



Sammond, Deanne W.
						; Kastelowitz, Noah
						; Himmel, Michael E.
						; ... JanuaryÂ 2016 - PLoS ONE


Understanding how proteins adapt to function at high temperatures is important for deciphering the energetics that dictate protein stability and folding. While multiple principles important for thermostability have been identified, we lack a unified understanding of how internal protein structural and chemical environment determine qualitative or quantitative impact of evolutionary mutations. In this work we compare equivalent clusters of spatially neighboring residues between paired thermophilic and mesophilic homologues to evaluate adaptations under the selective pressure of high temperature. We find the residue clusters in thermophilic enzymes generally display improved atomic packing compared to mesophilic enzymes, in agreement with previous research.moreÂ Â» Unlike residue clusters from mesophilic enzymes, however, thermophilic residue clusters do not have significant cavities. In addition, anchor residues found in many clusters are highly conserved with respect to atomic packing between both thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes. As a result, the improvements in atomic packing observed in thermophilic homologues are not derived from these anchor residues but from neighboring positions, which may serve to expand optimized protein core regions.Â«Â less

Strategies to reduce end-product inhibition in family 48 glycoside hydrolases



Chen, Mo
						; Bu, Lintao
						; Alahuhta, Markus
						; ... FebruaryÂ 2016 - Proteins


Family 48 cellobiohydrolases are some of the most abundant glycoside hydrolases in nature. They are able to degrade cellulosic biomass and therefore serve as good enzyme candidates for biofuel production. Family 48 cellulases hydrolyze cellulose chains via a processive mechanism, and produce end products composed primarily of cellobiose as well as other cellooligomers (dp â‰¤ 4). The challenge of utilizing cellulases in biofuel production lies in their extremely slow turnover rate. A factor contributing to the low enzyme activity is suggested to be product binding to enzyme and the resulting performance inhibition. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the productmoreÂ Â» inhibitory effect of four family 48 glycoside hydrolases using molecular dynamics simulations and product expulsion free-energy calculations. We also suggested a series of single mutants of the four family 48 glycoside hydrolases with theoretically reduced level of product inhibition. As a result, the theoretical calculations provide a guide for future experimental studies designed to produce mutant cellulases with enhanced activity.Â«Â less

New perspective on glycoside hydrolase binding to lignin from pretreated corn stover



Yarbrough, John M.
						; Mittal, Ashutosh
						; Mansfield, Elisabeth
						; ... DecemberÂ 2015 - Biotechnology for Biofuels


Background: Non-specific binding of cellulases to lignin has been implicated as a major factor in the loss of cellulase activity during biomass conversion to sugars. It is believed that this binding may strongly impact process economics through loss of enzyme activities during hydrolysis and enzyme recycling scenarios. The current model suggests glycoside hydrolase activities are lost though non-specific/non-productive binding of carbohydrate-binding domains to lignin, limiting catalytic site access to the carbohydrate components of the cell wall. Results: In this study, we compared component enzyme affinities of a commercial Trichoderma reesei cellulase formulation, Cellic CTec2, towards extracted corn stover lignin usingmoreÂ Â» sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and p-nitrophenyl substrate activities to monitor component binding, activity loss, and total protein binding. Protein binding was strongly affected by pH and ionic strength. Î²-D-glucosidases and xylanases, which do not have carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and are basic proteins, demonstrated the strongest binding at low ionic strength, suggesting that CBMs are not the dominant factor in enzyme adsorption to lignin. Despite strong adsorption to insoluble lignin, Î²-D-glucosidase and xylanase activities remained high, with process yields decreasing only 4â€“15 % depending on lignin concentration. Conclusion: We propose that specific enzyme adsorption to lignin from a mixture of biomass-hydrolyzing enzymes is a competitive affinity where Î²-D-glucosidases and xylanases can displace CBM interactions with lignin. Process parameters, such as temperature, pH, and salt concentration influence the individual enzymesâ€™ affinity for lignin, and both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are responsible for this binding phenomenon. Moreover, our results suggest that concern regarding loss of critical cell wall degrading enzymes to lignin adsorption may be unwarranted when complex enzyme mixtures are used to digest biomass.Â«Â less
