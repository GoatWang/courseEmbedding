convey to RFC III (collectively, the "Conveyance"), without recourse except as
provided herein, all of its right, title and interest, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, in, to and under the Receivables existing at the close of
business on the Initial Cut-Off Date, in the case of Receivables arising in the
Initial Accounts (including Related Accounts and Transferred Accounts with
respect to such Initial Accounts), and at the close of business on the related
Addition Cut-Off Date, in the case of Receivables arising in the Additional
Accounts (including Related Accounts and Transferred Accounts with respect to

in such Accounts, all Insurance Proceeds, Issuer Rate Fees and Recoveries
allocable to such Receivables, all monies due or to become due and all amounts
received or receivable with respect thereto, all Collections with respect
thereto, and all proceeds (including "proceeds" as defined in the UCC) thereof
(collectively, the "Purchased Assets"). The Receivables existing in the Initial
Accounts at the close of business on the Initial Cut-Off Date and thereafter
arising in the Initial Accounts on or prior to the Closing Date, and the related
Purchased Assets, shall be sold by Centurion and purchased by RFC III on the
Closing Date. Receivables arising after the Closing Date in the Initial Accounts
and the related Purchased Assets shall be sold by Centurion and purchased by RFC
III on the date such Receivables arise. The Receivables existing in Additional
Accounts at the close of business on the related Addition Cut-Off Date and
thereafter arising in such Additional Accounts on or prior to the related
Addition Date, and the related Purchased Assets, shall be sold by Centurion and
purchased by RFC III on the related Addition Date. Receivables arising after
such Addition Date in such Additional Accounts and the related Purchased Assets
shall be sold by Centurion and purchased by RFC III on the date such Receivables
arise.


(b) Centurion shall (i) record and file, at its own expense, any
financing statements (and amendments with respect to such financing statements
when applicable) with respect to the Purchased Assets meeting the requirements
of applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are
necessary to perfect, and maintain perfection of, the Conveyance of such
Purchased Assets from Centurion to RFC III, (ii) cause such financing statements
and amendments to name Centurion, as seller, and RFC III, as purchaser, of the
Purchased Assets and (iii) deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing
statements or amendments or other evidence of such filings to RFC III as soon as
is practicable after filing.


(c) Centurion shall, at its own expense, (i) on or prior to (x) the
Closing Date, in the case of Initial Accounts, and (y) the applicable Addition
Date, in the case of Additional Accounts, indicate in its books and records
(including its computer files) that Receivables created in connection with such
Accounts and the related Purchased Assets have been sold to RFC III in
accordance with this Agreement and have been conveyed by RFC III to the Trustee
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (ii) on or prior to (x) the
Closing Date, in the case of Initial Accounts, and (y) the applicable Addition
Date, in the case of Additional Accounts, deliver to RFC III an Account Schedule
(provided, however, that such Account Schedule shall be provided in respect of
New Accounts on the Distribution Date immediately succeeding the related Monthly
Period during which their respective Addition Dates occur) containing a true and
complete list of all such Accounts. Centurion shall not alter the indication
referenced in clause (i) of this paragraph with respect to any Account during
the term of this Agreement unless and until such Account is no longer an Account
or Centurion has taken such action as is necessary or advisable to cause the
interest of RFC III in the Purchased Assets to continue to be perfected and of
first priority. The Account Schedules, as supplemented and amended, collectively
shall be marked as Schedule 1 to this Agreement, shall be incorporated into and
made a part of this Agreement and shall be updated by Centurion on each Addition
Date (or with respect to New Accounts, on the Distribution Date immediately
succeeding the related Monthly Period during which their respective Addition
Dates occur), but not later than on a semi-annual basis to include any new
Related Accounts and Transferred Accounts.


10





(d) The parties hereto intend that the conveyance of Centurion's right,
title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets shall constitute an absolute
sale, conveying good title free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or
rights of others, from Centurion to RFC III. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that the arrangements with respect to the Purchased Assets shall
constitute a purchase and sale of such Purchased Assets and not a loan,
including for accounting purposes. In the event, however, that it were to be
determined that the transactions evidenced hereby constitute a loan and not a
purchase and sale, it is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement
shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law, and that Centurion
shall be deemed to have granted, and Centurion does hereby grant, to RFC III a
first priority perfected security interest in all of Centurion's right, title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the
Purchased Assets to secure the obligations of Centurion hereunder.


(e) To the extent that Centurion retains any interest in the Purchased
Assets, Centurion hereby grants to the Trustee a security interest in all of
Centurion's right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
in, to and under the Purchased Assets, to secure the performance of all of the
obligations of Centurion hereunder and under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. With respect to such security interest and such collateral, the
Trustee shall have all of the rights that it has under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. The Trustee shall also have all of the rights of a secured creditor
under the UCC.


(f) Centurion hereby acknowledges and agrees to perform its obligations
under Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.


Section 2.02. Addition of Accounts.


(a) If (i) RFC III is required, pursuant to Section 2.09(a) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to designate additional accounts to the Trust,
or (ii) RFC III elects, pursuant to Section 2.09(b) of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, to designate additional accounts to the Trust, then in either case
RFC III, at its option, may give written notice thereof to Centurion; provided,
however, that such notice shall be provided on or before the eighth (8th)
Business Day immediately preceding the related addition date. Upon receipt of
such notice and on or prior to such addition date, Centurion shall designate
sufficient Eligible Accounts as Aggregate Addition Accounts and shall sell to
RFC III the Purchased Assets related to such Aggregate Addition Accounts. In
addition, at its option and with the consent of RFC III, Centurion may designate
Eligible Accounts as Aggregate Addition Accounts and sell to RFC III the
Purchased Assets related to such Aggregate Addition Accounts.


11





(b) At its option and with the consent of RFC III, Centurion may
designate Eligible Accounts as New Accounts and sell to RFC III the Purchased
Assets related to such New Accounts. Centurion or RFC III, each at its option
and by written notice to the other party at least ten (10) days in advance, may
elect at any time to terminate the inclusion of new accounts which would
otherwise be New Accounts as of any Business Day, to suspend any such inclusion
as of any Business Day, or to resume any such inclusion as of any Business Day.


(c) On the Addition Date with respect to any designation of Additional
Accounts, such Additional Accounts shall become Accounts, and RFC III shall
purchase Centurion's right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables
in such Additional Accounts and the related Purchased Assets as provided in

Section 2.01, subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions on such
Addition Date:


(i) as of the Addition Selection Date, such Additional Accounts
shall be Eligible Accounts;


(ii) Centurion shall have delivered to RFC III copies of UCC
financing statements covering such Additional Accounts, if necessary to
perfect RFC III's interest in the Receivables arising therein and the
related Purchased Assets;


(iii) Centurion shall have delivered to RFC III all Collections with
respect to such Additional Accounts since the Addition Cut-Off Date;


(iv) as of each of the Addition Cut-Off Date and the Addition Date,
no Insolvency Event with respect to Centurion shall have occurred nor
shall the sale of the Receivables arising in the Additional Accounts and
the related Purchased Assets to RFC III have been made in contemplation of
the occurrence thereof;


(v) in the case of Aggregate Addition Accounts, such addition will
not have a material adverse effect on RFC III;


(vi) Centurion shall have delivered to RFC III an Officer's
Certificate of Centurion, dated the Addition Date, confirming, to the
extent applicable and in Centurion's reasonable belief, the items set
forth in clauses (i) through (v) above;


(vii) in the case of New Accounts, such addition will not cause a
Pay-Out Event or a Reinvestment Event under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement;


(viii) Centurion shall have indicated in its computer files that
Receivables created in connection with such Additional Accounts and the
related Purchased Assets have been sold to RFC III and, in the case of
Aggregate Addition Accounts, shall have delivered to RFC III the Account
Schedule with respect to such Aggregate Addition Accounts; and


(ix) Centurion and RFC III shall have entered into a duly executed,
written assignment, substantially in the form of Exhibit A (the
"Supplemental Conveyance").


Section 2.03. Removal and Deletion of Accounts.


(a) If an Account becomes a Removed Account, then Centurion shall stop
selling to RFC III Principal Receivables arising in such Removed Account
effective on the Business Day (the "Stop Date") after the date such Account
becomes a Removed Account. Notwithstanding the cessation of the sale to RFC III
of additional Principal Receivables arising in such Removed Account, Principal
Receivables sold to RFC III prior to the Stop Date, Collections in respect of
such Principal Receivables, Finance Charge Receivables whenever created that
accrue in respect of such Principal Receivables, Collections in respect of such
Finance Charge Receivables, and Issuer Rate Fees allocable to the foregoing
shall continue to be property of RFC III available for transfer by RFC III to
the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. To the extent that
it is not clear to Centurion whether collections relate to a Receivable that was
sold to RFC III or to a receivable that Centurion did not sell to RFC III,
Centurion shall allocate payments on each such Removed Account with respect to
the principal balance of such Removed Account first to the oldest principal
balance of such Removed Account.


12





(b) On and after the Stop Date for a Removed Account, Centurion may
mark its books and records to indicate that such Account is a Removed Account,
but Centurion shall not (i) alter the indication referenced in clause (i) of
Subsection 2.01(c) with respect to such Removed Account unless and until such
Account becomes a Deleted Account or Centurion has taken such action as is
necessary or advisable to cause the interest of RFC III in the Purchased Assets
to continue to be perfected and of first priority, or (ii) delete such Removed
Account from Schedule 1 hereto or any Account Schedule.


(c) Once a Removed Account becomes a Deleted Account, Centurion shall
promptly delete such Deleted Account from Schedule 1 hereto and shall indicate
in its computer files that such Deleted Account is no longer an Account.

CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT



Section 3.01. Purchase Price.


(a) The "Purchase Price" for the Receivables in the Initial Accounts
existing at the close of business on the Initial Cut-Off Date, and the related
Purchased Assets, that are conveyed to RFC III under this Agreement shall be
payable on April 19, 2004, in an amount equal to the fair market value of such
Receivables and the related Purchased Assets as mutually agreed upon by
Centurion and RFC III. This computation of initial purchase price shall assume
no reinvestment in new Receivables. The Purchase Price for the Receivables
(including Receivables in Additional Accounts) and the related Purchased Assets
conveyed to RFC III under this Agreement which come into existence after the
Initial Cut-Off Date (i) shall be payable on a date (the "Purchase Price Payment
Date") mutually agreed to by Centurion and RFC III, but no later than the 15th
calendar day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next following Business
Day) following the calendar month in which such Receivables and the related
Purchased Assets are conveyed by Centurion to RFC III and (ii) shall be an
amount equal to 100% of the aggregate balance of the Principal Receivables so
conveyed, adjusted to reflect such factors, if any, as Centurion and RFC III
mutually agree will result in a Purchase Price determined to be the fair market
value of such Principal Receivables and the related Purchased Assets. Centurion
hereby acknowledges, and agrees to perform in accordance with, Section 4.03(c)
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the related instructions of RFC III.


(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Centurion
shall not be obligated to continue to sell Receivables or other Purchased Assets
to RFC III to the extent that Centurion is not paid the Purchase Price therefor
as provided herein.


Section 3.02. Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall
be reduced on the Purchase Price Payment Date (a "Purchase Price Adjustment")
with respect to any Receivable previously conveyed to RFC III by Centurion which
is reduced by Centurion or the Servicer because of a rebate, refund, or billing
error to an Obligor, other than by reason of a Servicer error. The amount of
such reduction shall equal the reduction in the principal balance of such
Receivable resulting from the occurrence of such event. In the event that a
reduction pursuant to this Section 3.02 causes the Purchase Price to be a
negative number, Centurion agrees that, on the Purchase Price Payment Date,
Centurion shall pay or cause to be paid to RFC III an amount equal to the amount
by which the Purchase Price Adjustment exceeds the unadjusted Purchase Price;
provided, however, that if the reduction relating to such Purchase Price
Adjustment also gives rise to an obligation on the part of RFC III as Transferor
to make a deposit in the Special Funding Account pursuant to Section 3.09 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then Centurion and RFC III hereby agree that
the date that RFC III is required to make such deposit pursuant to Section 3.09
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be a Purchase Price Payment Date.


Section 3.03. Use of Name, Logo and Marks. Centurion does hereby grant
to RFC III a non-exclusive license to use the name "American Express Centurion

designs, servicing software, customer lists and other intangibles in connection
with the servicing of the Receivables purchased hereunder. The license granted

ARTICLE V




COVENANTS



Section 5.01. Covenants of Centurion. Centurion hereby covenants and
agrees with RFC III as follows:


(a) Receivables Not To Be Evidenced by Instruments. Except in
connection with its enforcement or collection of an Account, Centurion will take
no action to cause any Receivable sold to RFC III hereunder to be evidenced by
any instrument (as defined in the UCC), and if any Receivable is so evidenced as
a result of any action by Centurion, it shall be deemed to be a Receivable
described in Subsection 6.01(a) and shall be reassigned to Centurion in
accordance with Subsection 6.01(b).


(b) Security Interests. Except for the conveyances hereunder, Centurion
will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or take any other
action inconsistent with RFC III's ownership of, the Purchased Assets, or grant,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien arising through or under
Centurion on any Purchased Asset or any interest therein (other than any Lien
for municipal or other local taxes of Centurion if such taxes are not then due
and payable or if Centurion is then contesting the validity thereof in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and has set aside on its books adequate
reserves with respect thereto), and Centurion shall not claim any ownership
interest in any Purchased Asset and shall defend the right, title and interest
of RFC III in, to and under the Purchased Assets against all claims of third
parties claiming through or under Centurion.


(c) Account Allocations. If a Transfer Restriction Event occurs,
Centurion agrees (except as prohibited by any such order or any Requirement of
Law) to allocate and pay to RFC III, after the date of such Transfer Restriction
Event, all Collections with respect to Principal Receivables previously sold to
RFC III. To the extent that it is not clear to Centurion whether collections
relate to a Receivable that was sold to RFC III or to a receivable that
Centurion is unable to sell to RFC III, Centurion agrees that it shall allocate
payments on each Account with respect to the principal balance of such Account
first to the oldest principal balance of such Account. Notwithstanding any
cessation of the sale to RFC III of additional Principal Receivables, Principal
Receivables sold to RFC III prior to the occurrence of the Transfer Restriction
Event, Collections in respect of such Principal Receivables, Finance Charge
Receivables whenever created that accrue in respect of such Principal
Receivables, Collections in respect of such Finance Charge Receivables, and
Issuer Rate Fees allocable to the foregoing shall continue to be property of RFC
III available for transfer by RFC III to the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement.


(d) Delivery of Collections. In the event that Centurion receives
Collections or any other amounts in respect of the Purchased Assets sold to RFC
III hereunder, Centurion agrees to pay to RFC III (or to the Servicer or the
Trustee if RFC III so directs) all such Collections and other amounts promptly
after receipt thereof.


(e) Notice of Liens. Centurion shall notify RFC III promptly after
becoming aware of any Lien arising through or under Centurion on any Purchased
Asset other than the conveyances hereunder.


19





(f) Issuer Rate Fees. On each Distribution Date, Centurion shall pay to
RFC III, in immediately available funds, the amount of Issuer Rate Fees
allocable to the Receivables. Such amount of Issuer Rate Fees shall be equal to
the sum of (i) the product of (A) the rate at which issuer rate fees accrued to
Centurion during the second preceding Monthly Period on credit accounts owned by
Centurion, multiplied by (B) a fraction, (I) the numerator of which is the
aggregate amount of cardholder charges in all credit accounts owned by
Centurion, excluding balance transfer transactions, purchases made by
convenience checks, cash advances, certain ineligible products and services
offered by American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. or any
affiliate or subsidiary thereof, and all other transactions on which issuer rate
fees did not accrue to Centurion, in each case with respect to such Monthly
Period, and (II) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of cardholder
charges in all credit accounts owned by Centurion with respect to such Monthly
Period, multiplied by (C) new Principal Receivables that arose during such
Monthly Period in the Accounts that constitute credit accounts, plus (ii) the
product of (A) the rate at which issuer rate fees accrued to Centurion during
the second preceding Monthly Period on charge accounts or lines of credit owned
by Centurion, multiplied by (B) a fraction, (I) the numerator of which is the
aggregate amount of obligor charges on all charge accounts or lines of credit
owned by Centurion, excluding balance transfer transactions, purchases made by
convenience checks, cash advances, certain ineligible products and services
offered by American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. or any
affiliate or subsidiary thereof, and all other transactions on which issuer rate
fees did not accrue to Centurion, in each case with respect to such Monthly
Period, and (II) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of obligor
charges on all charge accounts or lines of credit owned by Centurion with
respect to such Monthly Period, multiplied by (C) new Principal Receivables that
arose during such Monthly Period in the Accounts that constitute charge accounts
or lines of credit.


(g) Documentation of Transfer. Centurion shall timely file in all
appropriate filing offices the documents which are necessary or advisable to
perfect and maintain the perfection of the sale of the Purchased Assets to RFC
III.


(h) Periodic Rate Finance Charges. Except (i) as otherwise required by
any Requirements of Law or (ii) as is deemed by Centurion to be necessary in
order for it to maintain its credit or charge business or a program operated by
such credit or charge business on a competitive basis based on a good faith
assessment by it of the nature of the competition with respect to such credit or
charge business or such program, Centurion shall not at any time reduce the
annual percentage rate of the Periodic Rate Finance Charges assessed on the
Receivables or take any other action with respect to any of the Accounts if, as
a result of any such action, Centurion's reasonable expectation is that such
action will cause a Pay-Out Event or a Reinvestment Event to occur under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement based on the insufficiency of Portfolio Yield or
any similar test. In addition, except as otherwise required by any Requirements
of Law, Centurion shall not at any time reduce the annual percentage rate of the
Periodic Rate Finance Charges assessed on the Receivables or take any other
action with respect to any of the Accounts if, as a result of any such action,
Centurion's reasonable expectation is that such action will cause the Portfolio
Yield under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be less than the then-current
highest Average Rate for any Group.


20





(i) Account Agreements and Guidelines. Subject to compliance with all
Requirements of Law and paragraph (h) above, Centurion may change the terms and
provisions of the Account Agreements or the Credit Guidelines applicable to the
Accounts in any respect (including the calculation of the amount or the timing
of charge-offs and the Periodic Rate Finance Charges to be assessed thereon).
Notwithstanding the above, unless required by Requirements of Law or as
permitted by paragraph (h) above, Centurion will not take any action with
respect to such Account Agreements or such Credit Guidelines which, at the time
of such action, Centurion reasonably believes will have a material adverse
effect on RFC III.


(j) Name and Type and Jurisdiction of Organization. Centurion shall not
change its name or its type or jurisdiction of organization without previously
having delivered to RFC III an opinion of counsel to the effect that all actions
have been taken, and all filings have been made, as are necessary to continue
and maintain the first-priority perfected ownership interest of RFC III in the
Purchased Assets.


(k) Annual Opinion. On or before March 31st of each calendar year,
commencing March 31, 2005, Centurion shall deliver to RFC III, with a copy to
the Trustee, an opinion of counsel to the effect that (i) no further action with
respect to the recording or filing of any financing statements, any amendments
to financing statements, or any other documents or filings is then necessary to
perfect the ownership interest of RFC III in the Purchased Assets, and (ii) no
further action with respect to the recording or filing of any financing
statements, any amendments to financing statements, or any other documents or
filings will be necessary prior to March 31st of the next calendar year to
perfect the ownership interest of RFC III in the Purchased Assets or stating
what such filings will be necessary prior to such March 31st.

to RFC III, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first Transfer
Date following the Monthly Period in which such reassignment obligation arises,
an amount equal to the unpaid balance of such Receivables. Upon reassignment of
such Receivables, RFC III shall automatically and without further action sell,
transfer, assign, set-over and otherwise convey to Centurion, without recourse,
representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of RFC III in and
to such Receivables, all Insurance Proceeds, Issuer Rate Fees and Recoveries
allocable to such Receivables, all monies due or to become due and all amounts
received or receivable with respect thereto, all Collections with respect
thereto, and all proceeds (including "proceeds" as defined in the UCC) thereof.
Such reassigned Receivables shall be treated by RFC III as collected in full as
of the date on which they were reassigned. RFC III shall execute such documents
and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such other actions as shall

Agreement or for any other reason, and notwithstanding the bankruptcy of RFC III
or any other event whatsoever, Centurion's sole remedy shall be a claim against
RFC III for money damages, and then only to the extent of funds available to RFC
III, and in no event shall Centurion assert any claim on or any interest in the
Purchased Assets or take any action which would reduce or delay receipt by the
Trustee of Collections with respect to the Purchased Assets. Additionally,
Centurion agrees that any amounts payable by Centurion to RFC III hereunder
which are to be paid by RFC III to the Trustee or the Servicer shall be paid by
Centurion directly to the Trustee or the Servicer, as applicable, as assignee of
RFC III.


Section 9.07. Further Assurances. RFC III and Centurion agree to do and
perform, from time to time, any and all acts and to execute any and all further

any financing statements or amendments thereto or equivalent documents relating
to the Purchased Assets for filing under the provisions of the UCC or other law
of any applicable jurisdiction.


Section 9.08. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise
and no delay in exercising, on the part of RFC III or Centurion, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exhaustive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.


Section 9.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (and by different parties on separate counterparts), each of

respective successors and permitted assigns. The Trust and the Trustee shall be
considered third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A




FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL CONVEYANCE



(As required by Section 2.02 of

the Receivables Purchase Agreement)


SUPPLEMENTAL CONVEYANCE No. [___], dated as of [__________], by and
between AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK, a Utah industrial loan company
(together with its permitted successors and assigns, "Centurion"), and AMERICAN
EXPRESS RECEIVABLES FINANCING CORPORATION III LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (together with its permitted successors and assigns, "RFC III"),
pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement referred to below.



W I T N E S S E T H:



WHEREAS, Centurion and RFC III are parties to a Receivables Purchase
Agreement, dated as of April 16, 2004 (hereinafter as such agreement may have
been, or may from time to time be, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified,
the "Receivables Purchase Agreement");


WHEREAS, pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, Centurion
wishes to designate Aggregate Addition Accounts to be included as Accounts and
Centurion wishes to convey its right, title and interest in the Receivables of
such Aggregate Addition Accounts, whether existing on the Addition Cut-Off Date
or thereafter created, to RFC III pursuant to the Receivables Purchase
Agreement; and


WHEREAS, RFC III is willing to accept such designation and conveyance
subject to the terms and conditions hereof.


NOW, THEREFORE, Centurion and RFC III hereby agree as follows:


1. Defined Terms. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Receivables Purchase Agreement unless otherwise
defined herein.


"Addition Date" shall mean, with respect to the Aggregate Addition
Accounts, [__________].


"Addition Cut-Off Date" shall mean, with respect to the Aggregate
Addition Accounts, [----------].


"Additional Purchased Assets" shall have the meaning set forth in
Subsection 3(a).


"Aggregate Addition Accounts" shall mean the Aggregate Addition
Accounts, as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, that are designated
hereby and listed on Schedule 1 hereto. [To be modified for New Accounts.]


A-1





2. Designation of Aggregate Addition Accounts. Centurion delivers
herewith an Account Schedule containing a true and complete list of the
Aggregate Addition Accounts. Such Account Schedule is incorporated into and made
part of this Supplemental Conveyance, shall be Schedule 1 to this Supplemental
Conveyance and shall supplement Schedule 1 to the Receivables Purchase
Agreement. [To be modified for New Accounts.]


3. Conveyance of Receivables.


(a) Centurion does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and
otherwise convey to RFC III, without recourse except as provided in the
Receivables Purchase Agreement, all of its right, title and interest, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the Receivables arising in the
Aggregate Addition Accounts (including Related Accounts and Transferred Accounts
with respect to such Aggregate Addition Accounts), existing at the close of
business on the Addition Cut-Off Date and thereafter created, all Insurance
Proceeds, Issuer Rate Fees and Recoveries allocable to such Receivables, all
monies due or to become due and all amounts received or receivable with respect
thereto, all Collections with respect thereto, and all proceeds (including
"proceeds" as defined in the UCC) thereof (collectively, the "Additional
Purchased Assets").


(b) In connection with such sale and if necessary, Centurion agrees to
record and file, at its own expense, one or more financing statements (and
amendments with respect to such financing statements when applicable) with
respect to the Additional Purchased Assets meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect the sale of the Additional Purchased Assets to RFC III, and to
deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing statements or amendments or other
evidence of such filing to RFC III.


(c) In connection with such sale, Centurion further agrees, at its own
expense, on or prior to the date of this Supplemental Conveyance, to indicate in
the appropriate computer files that all Receivables created in connection with
the Aggregate Addition Accounts and the related Additional Purchased Assets have
been conveyed to RFC III pursuant to this Supplemental Conveyance.


(d) The parties hereto intend that the conveyance of Centurion's right,
title and interest in and to the Additional Purchased Assets shall constitute an
absolute sale, conveying good title free and clear of any liens, claims,
encumbrances or rights of others from Centurion to RFC III. It is the intention
of the parties hereto that the arrangements with respect to the Additional
Purchased Assets shall constitute a purchase and sale of such Additional
Purchased Assets and not a loan, including for accounting purposes. In the
event, however, that it were to be determined that the transactions evidenced
hereby constitute a loan and not a purchase and sale, it is the intention of the
parties hereto that this Supplemental Conveyance shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law, and that Centurion shall be deemed to have
granted, and Centurion does hereby grant, to RFC III a first priority perfected
security interest in all of Centurion's right, title and interest, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the Additional Purchased Assets to
secure the obligations of Centurion hereunder and under the Receivables Purchase
Agreement.


A-2





(e) To the extent that Centurion retains any interest in the Additional
Purchased Assets, Centurion hereby grants to the Trustee a security interest in
all of Centurion's right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, in, to and under the Additional Purchased Assets, to secure the
performance of all of the obligations of Centurion hereunder, under the
Receivables Purchase Agreement and under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
With respect to such security interest and such collateral, the Trustee shall
have all of the rights that it has under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
The Trustee shall also have all of the rights of a secured creditor under the
UCC.


4. Acceptance by RFC III. RFC III hereby acknowledges that, prior to or
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Supplemental Conveyance,
Centurion delivered to RFC III the Account Schedule described in Section 2 of
this Supplemental Conveyance with respect to all Additional Accounts. [To be
modified for New Accounts.]


5. Representations and Warranties of Centurion. Centurion hereby
acknowledges on the Addition Date that it makes the representations and
warranties in Sections 4.01 and 4.02 of the Receivables Purchase Agreement with
respect to the Aggregate Addition Accounts.


6. Ratification of the Receivables Purchase Agreement. The Receivables
Purchase Agreement is hereby ratified, and all references to the "Receivables
Purchase Agreement," to "this Agreement" and "herein" shall be deemed from and
after the Addition Date to be a reference to the Receivables Purchase Agreement
as supplemented and amended by this Supplemental Conveyance. Except as expressly
amended hereby, all the representations, warranties, terms, covenants and
conditions of the Receivables Purchase Agreement shall remain unamended and
shall continue to be, and shall remain, in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and except as expressly provided herein shall not constitute or
be deemed to constitute a waiver of compliance with or consent to non-compliance
with any term or provision of the Receivables Purchase Agreement.


7. Counterparts. This Supplemental Conveyance may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.


8. GOVERNING LAW. THIS SUPPLEMENTAL CONVEYANCE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS
CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE
DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.


A-3





IN WITNESS WHEREOF, RFC III and Centurion have caused this Supplemental
Conveyance to be duly executed and delivered by their respective duly authorized
officers on the date first above written.

AMERICAN EXPRESS RECEIVABLES FINANCING CORP V LLC - S-3/A - 20060217 - PROCEED_USE





USE OF PROCEEDS



The net proceeds from the sale of each series, class and tranche of notes
offered hereby will be paid to the transferor and used by the transferor for
the general corporate purposes of the transferor, including the repayment of
amounts owed to TRS or certain of its affiliates.



THE ISSUING ENTITY



American Express Issuance Trust, also referred to as the issuance trust or
the issuing entity, is a statutory trust created under the laws of the State
of Delaware on May 18, 2005. The issuing entity's principal offices are in
Delaware, in case of Wilmington Trust Company, as owner trustee, at the
following address: Rodney Square North, 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington,
Delaware 19890-1600. Its phone number is (302) 651-1000.


RFC V is the depositor and transferor to the issuance trust. Pursuant to
receivables purchase agreements, each of Centurion and FSB sells to TRS its
right, title and interest in the receivables in the accounts designated to be
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio, and TRS sells its right, title and
interest in the receivables in those accounts and receivables in accounts
owned by TRS to RFC V. See "Description of the Receivables Purchase Agreements
and the Sale Agreements" in this prospectus. Those receivables are then
transferred, subject to certain conditions, by RFC V to the issuing entity.
See "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Addition of Assets" in this
prospectus. RFC V or any of its affiliates may also be a transferor to master
trusts or other securitization special purpose entities which issue collateral
certificates that are included in the issuance trust.


Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been and will be filed, to
the extent appropriate, to perfect the ownership or security interests of the
issuing entity and the indenture trustee described herein. See "Risk Factors"
in this prospectus for a discussion of risks associated with the issuing
entity and the issuing entity's assets and see "Description of the Receivables
Purchase Agreements and the Sale Agreements," "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Representations and Warranties" and "The Indenture--Issuing Entity
Covenants" in this prospectus for a discussion of certain covenants regarding
the perfection of security interests.


The issuing entity operates under a trust agreement, dated as of May 18,
2005, as amended from time to time, between RFC V, as transferor, and
Wilmington Trust Company. The issuing entity does not have any officers or
directors. Currently, its sole beneficiary is RFC V, although affiliates of
RFC V may be beneficiaries in the future. The powers and duties of the owner
trustee are ministerial only.  Accordingly, as beneficiary, RFC V will direct
the owner trustee in the management of the issuing entity and its assets.


39





RFC V and the owner trustee may amend the trust agreement without the
consent of the noteholders or the indenture trustee so long as the amendment
is not reasonably expected to (i) adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of the noteholders or (ii) significantly change the permitted
activities of the issuing entity, as set forth in the trust agreement.
Accordingly, neither the indenture trustee nor any holder of any note will be
entitled to vote on any such amendment.


In addition, RFC V and the owner trustee may amend the trust agreement if
holders of not less than (i) in the case of a significant change in the
permitted activities of the issuing entity which the issuing entity does not
reasonably expect to have a material adverse effect on the noteholders, a
majority of the aggregate outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes
affected by an amendment consent, and (ii) in all other cases, 66 2/3% of the
aggregate outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes affected by an
amendment consent; however, unless all of the holders of the aggregate
outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes consent, the trust agreement
may not be amended for the purpose of (a) increasing or reducing the amount
of, or accelerating or delaying the timing of, collections of payments in
respect of the assets of the issuance trust or distributions that are required
to be made for the benefit of the noteholders or (b) reducing the percentage
of holders of the outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes the holders
of which are required to consent to any amendment.


See "The Indenture--Tax Opinions for Amendments" in this prospectus for
additional conditions to amending the trust agreement.


The issuing entity's activities will include, but not be limited to:


o acquiring and holding the receivables, collateral certificates and other
assets of the issuing entity and the proceeds from these assets;


o issuing notes;


o making payments on the notes; and


o engaging in other activities that are necessary or incidental to
accomplish these limited purposes.


As of the date of this prospectus, the issuing entity's primary assets are:


o receivables arising in designated consumer and small business charge
accounts owned by TRS, Centurion and FSB; and


o funds on deposit in the issuing entity accounts.


In the future, the issuance trust may include receivables arising in
designated commercial charge accounts owned by TRS or any of its affiliates,
receivables arising in additional designated consumer and small business
accounts owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates and
collateral certificates, each representing an undivided interest in a master
trust or other securitization special purpose entity, whose assets consist
primarily of receivables in designated charge accounts owned by TRS,
Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates. It is not expected that the issuing
entity will have any other significant assets or means of capitalization.  The
fiscal year for the issuing entity will end on December 31 of each year.


40





The issuing entity has established a collection account for the purpose of
receiving collections on receivables and any other assets included in the
issuance trust, including collections on any collateral certificates included
in the issuance trust. The issuing entity also has established an
overconcentration account for the purpose of holding Principal Collections
that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the transferor interest at a
time when the Commercial Obligor Overconcentration Amount is greater than zero
and the Available Overconcentration Account Amount is, or as a result of a
payment would become, less than the Required Overconcentration Account Amount.
In addition, the issuing entity has established an excess funding account for
the purpose of holding Principal Collections that would otherwise be paid to
the holder of the transferor interest at a time when (i) the Transferor Amount
is, or as a result of a payment would become, less than the Required
Transferor Amount or (ii) the Pool Balance is, or as a result of a payment
would become, less than the Required Pool Balance.


As described in the related prospectus supplement, receivables originated
under the designated charge accounts included in the issuing entity's
Portfolio consist of amounts charged by accountholders for merchandise and
services, annual membership fees and certain other administrative fees billed
to accountholders on the accounts. These receivables generally are not subject
to monthly finance charge assessments. See "Domestic Charge Card Business" in
this prospectus. As a result, in order to provide yield to the issuance trust
with respect to the related receivables, pursuant to the transfer and
servicing agreement, a portion of the receivables in the accounts included in
the issuing entity's Portfolio are treated as finance charge receivables and
collections received with respect to such receivables are treated as Finance
Charge Collections. The remainder of such receivables are treated as principal
receivables and collections received with respect to such receivables are
treated as Principal Collections. See "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Discount Option" and "Risk Factors--A change in the discount option
percentage may result in the payment of principal earlier or later than
expected" in this prospectus.



TRS, CENTURION, FSB, RFC V AND CREDCO




TRS



TRS is the sponsor of the issuance trust and, as such, organizes and

"Domestic Charge Card Business" in this prospectus. In addition, TRS is the

the Notes--Collection and Other Servicing Procedures" in this prospectus for a

since 1992, when it formed and serviced the American Express Master Trust. The
American Express Master Trust issued an aggregate of approximately $7.4
billion principal amount of investor certificates, all of which were paid on
their respective expected final payment dates. TRS no longer uses the American
Express Master Trust to securitize consumer charge receivables, as charge
receivables are now securitized through the issuance trust. In addition, TRS
is the servicer of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust, which was
created in 1996 to


41





securitize credit card receivables and which has issued an aggregate of $[ ]

amount is currently outstanding.

New York, New York 10285-4405. Its phone number is (212) 640-2000. TRS was
incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on May 3, 1982. TRS,

of products and services worldwide, including global card network services,
charge and credit cards for consumers, small businesses and corporations,

Cheques and prepaid card products, business expense management products and
services, business travel and travel management services, consumer travel
services, merchant acquiring and transaction processing, point-of-sale and
back-office products and services for merchants and magazine publishing.
American Express-branded cards are currently issued in more than 45 currencies
(including cards issued by third-party banks and other institutions). In 2004,
American Express TRS's worldwide billed business (spending on American
Express-branded cards, including cards issued by third parties) was $416
billion, with approximately $305 billion coming from card holders domiciled in
the United States.



CENTURION



Centurion is an account owner of certain consumer charge accounts, the
receivables of which are included in the issuance trust. See "Domestic Charge
Card Business" in this prospectus. In addition, on behalf of TRS, Centurion

Other Servicing Procedures" in this prospectus for a description of certain
matters relating to the servicing functions provided by Centurion.


Centurion has been involved in the securitization of consumer charge
receivables since 1998, when it was added as a transferor to the American
Express Master Trust described above. In addition, Centurion is a sponsor of
the American Express Credit Account Master Trust, through which Centurion has
been securitizing credit card receivables since 1996.


Centurion is an industrial bank incorporated under the laws of the State of
Utah in 1987. It received FDIC insurance in 1989. Its principal office is
located at 4315 South 2700 West, Salt Lake City, Utah 84184 and its phone
number is (801) 945-5000. Centurion is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRS.
Centurion is the surviving company of a 1996 merger with an affiliated bank
which also was named American Express Centurion Bank. In connection with the
merger, Centurion assumed all of the rights and obligations of the affiliated
bank with respect to the accounts owned by it.



FSB



FSB is an account owner of certain consumer and small business charge
accounts, the receivables of which are included in the issuance trust. See
"Domestic Charge Card Business" in this prospectus. In addition, on behalf of
TRS, FSB performs certain limited servicing functions with respect to the
receivables in the issuance trust. See "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Collection and Other Servicing Procedures" in this prospectus for a
description of certain matters relating to the servicing functions provided by
FSB.


42





FSB has been involved in the securitization of consumer charge receivables
since 2004, when it was added as a transferor to the American Express Master
Trust. In addition, FSB is a sponsor of the American Express Credit Account
Master Trust.


FSB was chartered by the Office of Thrift Supervision under the laws of the
United States of America as a federal savings bank in 2000 and received FDIC
insurance in 2000. Its principal office is located at 4315 South 2700 West,
Salt Lake City, Utah 84184 and its phone number is (801) 945-3000. FSB is a
wholly owned subsidiary of TRS. In December 2003, FSB and certain of its
affiliates received OTS approval to, among other things, transfer ownership of

headquarters from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Salt Lake City, Utah and amend its
business plan to permit FSB to offer certain credit, charge and consumer
lending products, small business loans, mortgages and mortgage-related
products and a transactional Internet site. The implementation of the changes
to FSB's business plan began in the first quarter of 2004 with the transfer of
certain credit card and charge accounts form Centurion to FSB.



RFC V



RFC V is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of
Delaware on December 14, 2004.  Its sole member is TRS.  RFC V is the
depositor and transferor of the issuing entity.  The address for RFC V is 200
Vesey Street, Room 507A, New York, New York 10285 and its telephone number is

(212) 640-2354.  RFC V was formed for the limited purpose of purchasing,
holding, owning and transferring receivables and related activities.  Since
its formation, RFC V has been engaged in these activities solely as (i) the
purchaser of receivables from TRS pursuant to the related receivables purchase
agreement, (ii) the transferor of receivables to the issuing entity pursuant
to the transfer and servicing agreement, (iii) the beneficiary and transferor
that formed and capitalized the issuing entity pursuant to the trust
agreement, (iv) the holder of the transferor interest in the issuing entity
and (v) the beneficiary and transferor that executes underwriting,
subscription and purchase agreements in connection with each issuance of
notes.  RFC V may also act as the depositor for other master trusts or
securitization special purpose entities affiliated with TRS, but has not done
so to date.


A description of RFC V's obligations as transferor of the receivables to the
issuance trust can be found in "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Required
Transferor Amount," "--Required Pool Balance," "--Increases in the Invested
Amount of an Existing Collateral Certificate," "--Addition of Assets," "--
Removal of Assets" and "--Representations and Warranties" in this prospectus.


RFC V was initially capitalized by a cash contribution from TRS.  Pursuant
to a revolving credit agreement, RFC V may borrow funds from TRS for the sole
purpose of purchasing receivables from TRS under the related receivables
purchase agreement.  Under the revolving credit agreement, payments from RFC V
are due only to the extent that those funds are not required for any other
purpose and so long as the payment will not cause RFC V to default under the
transfer and servicing agreement.


In addition, other affiliates of TRS may be transferors of assets to the
issuance trust.


43

The owner trustee may resign at any time by giving 30 days prior written
notice to the beneficiary.  The owner trustee may also be removed as owner
trustee if it becomes insolvent, it is no longer eligible to act as owner
trustee under the trust agreement or by a written instrument delivered by the
beneficiary to the owner trustee.  The beneficiary must appoint a successor
owner trustee.  If a successor owner trustee has not been appointed within 30
days after giving notice of resignation or removal, the owner trustee or the
beneficiary may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a
successor owner trustee.  This court-appointed owner trustee will only act in
such capacity until the time, if any, as a successor owner trustee is
appointed by the beneficiary.

corporation under the laws of its state of incorporation or a national banking
association, having all corporate powers and all material government licenses,
authorization, consents and approvals required to carry on a trust business in
the State of Delaware, (ii) comply with the relevant provisions of the
Delaware Statutory Trust Act, (iii) have a combined capital and surplus of not
less than $50,000,000 (or have its obligations and liabilities irrevocably and

$50,000,000) and (iv) have (or have a parent which has) a rating of at least
Baa3 by Moody's, at least BBB- by Standard & Poor's or, if not rated,

trustee under the trust agreement.
