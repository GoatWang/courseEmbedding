Richard Nathan Haass (born July 28, 1951) is an American diplomat. He has been president of the Council on Foreign Relations since July 2003, prior to which he was Director of Policy Planning for the United States Department of State and a close advisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. The Senate approved Haass as a candidate for the position of ambassador and he has been U.S. Coordinator for the Future of Afghanistan. He succeeded George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland to help the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which he received the State Department's Distinguished Service Award. At the end of 2003, Mitchell Reiss succeeded him as special envoy. In late 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland to chair inter-party talks aimed at addressing some of the unresolved issues from the peace process such as parades, flags and "the past".[3]

Early life and education[edit]

Haass was born in Brooklyn, the son of Marcella (née Rosenthal) and Irving B. Haass.[4][5] His family is Jewish.
Career[edit]
From 1989 to 1993, Haass was Special Assistant to United States President George H. W. Bush and National Security Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs. In 1991, Haass received the Presidential Citizens Medal for helping to develop and explain U.S. policy during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Previously, he served in various posts in the Department of State (1981–85) and the Department of Defense (1979–80).
Haass's other postings include Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz Visiting Professor of International Studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes Scholar, Haass obtained a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and went on to earn both a Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.[6]
Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, Haass advised several members of both the Republican Party and Democratic Party on issues regarding foreign policy, but did not publicly endorse a candidate due to the Council on Foreign Relations' non-partisan stance.[7]
In September 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland, with Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, to chair all party talks on flags, parades and the legacy of the Troubles, after violence flared over the removal of the union flag at Belfast City Hall. The talks broke up without reaching an agreement on December 31, 2013.[3]
Haass is the author of 12 books, of which 11 deal with matters of foreign policy and one with management.
Personal life[edit]
Haass lives in New York City with his wife, Susan Mercandetti,[8] and two children.
Foreign policy views[edit]
Haass most clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book The Reluctant Sheriff (1997). In his book, Haass argued that the United States should play the role of international sheriff. Maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff, one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks,” Haass writes (Haass 1997, 6). In other words, Haass called on the United States to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system. While Haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system, he also made it clear that he intended for the United States to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world. In the years ahead, “what will prove crucial is the ability of the United States to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the United States to act as a sheriff, to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges,” Haass notes (Haass 1997, 44).
After Haass completed The Reluctant Sheriff, he provided a bolder vision for U.S. foreign policy in his lecture “Imperial America” at the Atlanta Conference in November 2000. In his lecture, Haass argued that the leaders of the United States should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal American empire (Haass 2000). The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).
In a May 2015 interview with BBC's HARDtalk, speaking as President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history, in part due to the muting of U.S. dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and non-state entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism, and several policy failures, which may bring about an "era of disorder" in the absence of any clear superpower. The failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the notion that the Iraqi regime had any involvement with the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general, but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that Saddam Hussein's regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction, a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community "got wrong". He explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the "ill-advised" invasion of Iraq were compounded by subsequent errors, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops carried out under the Obama administration. Another major error, according to Haass, was the failure of the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the Syrian civil war, leaving room for the Islamic State to gain a foothold. He has also stated he was against U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War, but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable, better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled, resulting in a situation in which the people of Libya are "arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of Muammar Gaddafi." These seemingly incongruous positions, he argues, demonstrate that consistency, when it comes to foreign relations, "is a bad idea", and that each situation requires a custom-fit approach. Maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely non-interventionist foreign policy, for example, would be a mistake.[9]

Previously, he served in various posts in the Department of State (1981–85) and the Department of Defense (1979–80).
Haass's other postings include Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz Visiting Professor of International Studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes Scholar, Haass obtained a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and went on to earn both a Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.[6]
Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, Haass advised several members of both the Republican Party and Democratic Party on issues regarding foreign policy, but did not publicly endorse a candidate due to the Council on Foreign Relations' non-partisan stance.[7]
In September 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland, with Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, to chair all party talks on flags, parades and the legacy of the Troubles, after violence flared over the removal of the union flag at Belfast City Hall. The talks broke up without reaching an agreement on December 31, 2013.[3]
Haass is the author of 12 books, of which 11 deal with matters of foreign policy and one with management.
Personal life[edit]
Haass lives in New York City with his wife, Susan Mercandetti,[8] and two children.
Foreign policy views[edit]
Haass most clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book The Reluctant Sheriff (1997). In his book, Haass argued that the United States should play the role of international sheriff. Maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff, one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks,” Haass writes (Haass 1997, 6). In other words, Haass called on the United States to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system. While Haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system, he also made it clear that he intended for the United States to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world. In the years ahead, “what will prove crucial is the ability of the United States to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the United States to act as a sheriff, to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges,” Haass notes (Haass 1997, 44).
After Haass completed The Reluctant Sheriff, he provided a bolder vision for U.S. foreign policy in his lecture “Imperial America” at the Atlanta Conference in November 2000. In his lecture, Haass argued that the leaders of the United States should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal American empire (Haass 2000). The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).
In a May 2015 interview with BBC's HARDtalk, speaking as President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history, in part due to the muting of U.S. dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and non-state entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism, and several policy failures, which may bring about an "era of disorder" in the absence of any clear superpower. The failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the notion that the Iraqi regime had any involvement with the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general, but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that Saddam Hussein's regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction, a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community "got wrong". He explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the "ill-advised" invasion of Iraq were compounded by subsequent errors, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops carried out under the Obama administration. Another major error, according to Haass, was the failure of the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the Syrian civil war, leaving room for the Islamic State to gain a foothold. He has also stated he was against U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War, but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable, better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled, resulting in a situation in which the people of Libya are "arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of Muammar Gaddafi." These seemingly incongruous positions, he argues, demonstrate that consistency, when it comes to foreign relations, "is a bad idea", and that each situation requires a custom-fit approach. Maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely non-interventionist foreign policy, for example, would be a mistake.[9]

The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).
In a May 2015 interview with BBC's HARDtalk, speaking as President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history, in part due to the muting of U.S. dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and non-state entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism, and several policy failures, which may bring about an "era of disorder" in the absence of any clear superpower. The failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the notion that the Iraqi regime had any involvement with the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general, but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that Saddam Hussein's regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction, a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community "got wrong". He explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the "ill-advised" invasion of Iraq were compounded by subsequent errors, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops carried out under the Obama administration. Another major error, according to Haass, was the failure of the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the Syrian civil war, leaving room for the Islamic State to gain a foothold. He has also stated he was against U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War, but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable, better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled, resulting in a situation in which the people of Libya are "arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of Muammar Gaddafi." These seemingly incongruous positions, he argues, demonstrate that consistency, when it comes to foreign relations, "is a bad idea", and that each situation requires a custom-fit approach. Maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely non-interventionist foreign policy, for example, would be a mistake.[9]

Expert Bio

Dr. Richard Haass is in his fifteenth year as president of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent, nonpartisan membership organization, think tank, publisher, and educational institution dedicated to being a resource to help people better understand the world and the foreign policy choices facing the United States and other countries.
In 2013, he served as the chair of the multiparty negotiations in Northern Ireland that provided the foundation for the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. For his efforts to promote peace and conflict resolution, he received the 2013 Tipperary International Peace Award.
From January 2001 to June 2003, Dr. Haass was director of policy planning for the Department of State, where he was a principal advisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Confirmed by the U.S. Senate to hold the rank of ambassador, Dr. Haass also served as U.S. coordinator for policy toward the future of Afghanistan and U.S. envoy to the Northern Ireland peace process. In recognition of his service, he received the State Department’s Distinguished Honor Award.
Dr. Haass has extensive additional government experience. From 1989 to 1993, he was special assistant to President George H.W. Bush and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs on the staff of the National Security Council. In 1991, Dr. Haass was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal for his contributions to the development and articulation of U.S. policy during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Previously, he served in the Departments of State (1981–1985) and Defense (1979–1980), and was a legislative aide in the U.S. Senate.
Dr. Haass also was vice president and director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz visiting professor of international studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes scholar, Dr. Haass holds a bachelor’s degree from Oberlin College and master’s and doctorate degrees from Oxford University. He has also received numerous honorary degrees.
Dr. Haass is the author or editor of thirteen books on American foreign policy and one book on management. His latest book is A World in Disarray: American Foreign Policy and the Crisis of the Old Order, published in 2017 by Penguin Press.

Who Will Fill America’s Shoes?










NEW YORK – It is increasingly clear that US President Donald Trump represents a departure when it comes to America’s global outlook and behavior. As a result, the United States will no longer play the leading international role that has defined its foreign policy for three quarters of a century, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike.

We have already seen many examples of this change. The traditional US commitment to global organizations has been superseded by the idea of “America first.” Alliances and security guarantees once regarded as a given are increasingly conditioned on how much allies spend on defense and whether they are seen to derive unfair advantage from trade with the US.





More broadly, foreign trade is viewed with suspicion – supposedly a source of job loss rather than an engine of investment, job creation, growth, and stability. Immigration and refugee policies have become more restrictive. Less emphasis is being placed on promoting democracy and human rights. More dollars are going to defense, but fewer resources are being devoted to supporting global health or development.

This is not to be confused with isolationism. Even Trump’s America will continue to play a meaningful role in the world. It is using military force in the Middle East and Afghanistan, increasing diplomatic pressure on North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And the policies of states, cities, and companies will translate into an American commitment to climate change, despite Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris agreement.

Still, a shift away from a US-dominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions and toward something else is under way. What this alternative will be, however, remains largely unknowable. What we do know is that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the US role.

China is a frequently mentioned candidate, but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economic-growth rates to stave off popular unrest. China’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence, rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements.

Likewise, Russia is a country with a narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing Russian influence in the Middle East and Europe. India is preoccupied with the challenge of economic development and is tied down by its problematic relationship with Pakistan. Japan is held back by its declining population, domestic political and economic constraints, and its neighbors’ suspicions.

Europe, for its part, is distracted by questions surrounding the relationship between member states and the European Union. As a result, the whole of the continent is less than the sum of its parts – none of which is large enough to succeed America on the world stage.

But the absence of a single successor to the US does not mean that what awaits is chaos. At least in principle, the world’s most powerful countries could come together to fill America’s shoes. In practice, though, this will not happen, as these countries lack the capabilities, experience, and, above all, a consensus on what needs doing and who needs to do it.

A more likely development is the emergence of a mix of order and disorder at both the regional and global level. China will promote various trade, infrastructure, and security mechanisms in Asia. The 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership may launch their trade pact without the US.

Less clear is whether China is prepared to use its influence to restrain North Korea, how India and Pakistan will avoid conflict, and the resolution of Asia’s many territorial disputes. It is all too easy to imagine an Asian and Pacific future characterized by higher spending on arms of all types – and thus more susceptible to violent conflict.

The Middle East is already suffering unprecedented instability, the result of local rivalries and realities, and of 15 years during which the US arguably first did too much and then too little to shape the region’s future. The immediate danger is not just further deterioration in failed states such as Yemen, Syria, and Libya, but also direct conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Europe may be something of an exception to such trends, as the election of President Emmanuel Macron in France has given rise to a government that is committed to reforming the EU. But the EU itself faces an uncertain future, given Brexit and slow-motion crises in Italy and Greece, not to mention the potential for additional Russian mischief or worse.




DONATE NOW



To all of this, one could add the meltdown in Venezuela and the all-too-familiar horrors in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And then there is the growing gap between global challenges such as how to govern cyberspace, and the willingness of governments to work together to address them.

There is no little irony in this global turn of events. For decades, many countries criticized US policy, both for what it was and what it was not. These same countries now face the prospect of a world in which American leadership is likely to be less of a factor. It is far from clear that they are prepared for such a world, or that they will find themselves better off in it.

                Another useless article by an official, academic, whatever. The real reason no other country can replace the USA doesn't have anything to do with foreign policy. It has everything to do with that there's no other country that can replace the US' trade deficits, i.e. no other country wants to absorb the world's output. Read more

                I certainly agree with the point that Mr Neunuebel puts  forward by saying that "All of the hand-wringing issues the author brings up have been ever present when the US was the so called "leader" of global affairs". America has been the part of the problems rather than solutions. I doubt very much that  US is not aware of its wrong foreign policy it has been practicing. It has been consciously designed. The consequences with which the whole world has been facing in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria  are the outcomes of the foreign policy. If as the author claims that US was the leader of the world, there is no one else to hold  accountable for the issues, but US.  For example, one of the biggest failures of US was that it never used democratic principles as a MUST in dealing with undemocratic systems. On the contrary, it has been interested in gain determined in line with its  economic and political interests, regardless of considering the long term painful consequences. Donald Trump he is, probably,  the worst one that US has ever experienced in the context of democracy, human rights and environment.  Read more

                Well slit my throat.  This is an astoundingly ridiculous article.  All of the hand-wringing issues the author brings up have been ever present when the US was the so called "leader" of global affairs.  They didn't and won't crop up just because we have four years of an idiot for President.  Regarding the statement about China's, "artificially high economic-growth rates," by all metrics China is considered the 2nd largest economy in the world behind the US and maybe even #1.  If that is then "artificial" then one must assume that the metric is equally as useless in evaluating the US economy as #1.  The article is a silly waste of time and I, of course, wasted it.

                'Trump represents a departure when it comes to America’s global outlook and behavior. 'Only to its superficial aspects - the manner in which, and manners with which, it presents itself to the world. . His policies are unchanged; only his manner is different. His foreign policy is a continuation of previous administrations', which is an incomprehending and blundering bullying. ISIS for example (let's ignore its genesis) is in no way an 'existential threat' to anyone outside the middle-east. Hellish to live with, but 'we' don't. The occasional ISIS-inspired atrocity is a pinprick, not an existential crisis. Yes, even the infamous '9/11'. The view of Trump as an anomaly is I think wrong; when was he first praised as 'plausibly presidential'?- when he threw missiles at an empty airfield, then used an 11 ton bomb on a largely deserted area. That is America's comfort zone; and that will not be missed  (by others) at all.America as 'guardian of democratic ideals?' Don't make me sneer. Saudi Arabia is only one of the more egregious counterexamples. Warlord Duterte of the Philippines is another. And try to tell me with a straight face that we're supporting 'democracy' in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Libya we daren't mention. And so on. None of these little difficulties can be laid at The Donald's feet. America will go on galumphing around the planet for quite  a while after Trump is a bad memory. The world needs neither nanny nor Sheriff (movie sense). Read more

                Recent developments under the Trump Administration do point to a reorientation of America's approach on its global leadership role, but it is too early to point a significant shift from its earlier policy. America first in a welcome step for the US to strengthen itself. However, the emerging world order points to an era where the responsibility of managing and influencing global affairs will not be confined to America alone, but will be increasingly shared by other emerging powers in various parts of the globe. The US must enhance its relations with like minded emerging powers, such as India, which are capable and more importantly willing to shoulder additional responsibility, at least in their part of the world. Convergence of mutual interests at a global level to ensure peaceful rise of nations is essential for such partnerships and alliances.  Read more

                Laments for the loss of American Global leadership are in truth based far more on fear of international instability than on any real loss of Global vision from the US.  Lets be honest - many, if not most of the leadership exercised by America has been a disaster for the World, from the reckless invasion of Iraq in 2003 to the financial excesses which led to the Global banking collapse in 2008.  If the absence of a strong American agenda allows the rest of the World to mature and take responsibility for growing a new international community, perhaps we should welcome rather than fear the open page it presents.Of course national agendas remain partisan, as they always have. But regardless of Trump,  we are inching inexorably towards a more integrated Global society.   The reality of problems which can ONLY be solved through Global cooperation, from climate change and tax evasion to combating infectious disease or internet saboteurs, these common issues will sooner or later ensure that everyone has to come back to the same table.Of course we are now in for a long interim while Trump remains president, but like the demise of coal and the replacement of jobs by new automated technology, the underlying Global trends taking shape today are unstoppable.  The only question is how long it will take us to respond to them with greater Global cooperation.Robert P Bruce - author www.TheGlobalRace.net Read more

                Global cooperation?? Perhaps... but has a student of history I find Global War a much more likely prospect. "Global cooperation" requires a certain level of willing sacrifice by the people unfortunately the losers of Globalization are so very tired of making sacrifices for strangers their is no will or acceptance for it. At this point a growing plurality of people in the first world's middle and working classes that would not urinate on a foreigner if he was on fire. The chances of anymore sacrifices for China, Mexico, India or nearly any 3rd world nations closely approximates zero. Read more

                Who will fill America's shoes? Let's have a stab at this. China will spend a trillion building a high-speed transport system to Europe, Africa and Asia, to allow it's economic miracle conclude it's final chapter and become the world's industrial backbone. From Africa the caravan will return with produce from the many chinese-acquired agricultural lands.Europe, having for years successfully stitched up the US  for it's heavy defence needs, will now turn increasingly to independence in  the economic, political and military fields. Thanks to the spirit of  goodwill there the EU will democratically reform and overcome it's internal contradictions. The Euro will flourish.Africa will go through a population explosion and Africans will migrate to every corner of the planet. Economic development there will be achieved with continuing help from the Chinese who will lift the continent from poverty following the same path as they have themselves. Start with simple things first, like roads and rail, trade and export, then continue a step at a time.The United States will continue to spend trillions on military bases around the world and on preparing for a world war with Russia, China and the Arab countries. In the long run, the cost of their military adventurism will bankrupt the nation, much like the nuclear arms race bankrupted the USSR. Slowly the world will come to realise that prosperity and wellbeing come from social justice and respect. The planet-destroying arsenals will fall into disrepair and the world's focus will be on ecosystem repair and undoing the damage done to the climate by a corporate-industrial-military-neoliberal culture out of control. Politicians will step up who know that to have our planet we will need to save it from destruction. Whether any of them will be American, we may only guess. Read more

                If you believe this I have a bridge to sell you great view of Brooklyn. Spirit of goodwill in Europe? Would Greece, Italy or Cyprus agree? I think not. And the chances of China doing anything for Africa that does not directly advantage China closely approximates......Zero. As for Social Justice respect in the world that is quite possibly the funniest thing I have heard in decades. Social Justice & respect in... China where???  In China justice is reserved for the rich powerful and the princes of the right families has for the peasants Not a Chance. And if anything Africa is in even worse shape and shows no signs of changing. My personal guess is the system will disintegrate into war but I hope I'm wrong. But if you believe China will spread social Justice & respect you should look at the facts in China. Read more

                Mr. Haas:  Who will fill those shoes, indeed.  However, as strident as our anti-globalist rhetoric becomes,  big finance and bit technology can only congratulate themselves:  they don’t have to care at all. Why, every law goes to their benefit, and everyone else has to adapt.  The American Empire is different to others,  I think, because, even if America now steps back, its legacy flourishes.  People everywhere now has to pay for big Finance’s extravaganzas,  and wait to be displaced at work by Big Technology.   Let the citizens find fault in immigrants, trade, in their political parties.  Don’t wake them up. Read more

                Richard N. Haass laments that America under Trump is abandoning its role as  guarantor of  the current global world order  -  a role "that has defined its foreign policy for three quarters of a century, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike." That order has enabled 70 years of prosperity, thanks to market-oriented regimes of trade liberalisation, increased capital mobility, and appropriate social welfare policies. Countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia have been able to share America's security umbrella - through Nato and various other alliances.Trump sees foreign policy and trade through the prism of his  'America first' approach. While slashing the budget for foreign policy and agencies that promote soft power, he has increased military spending. He is  making America's decades-old allies to foot their defence bill, and has threatened to impose punitive tariffs to tackle trade deficits. He blames the loss of jobs and falling incomes on foreign competition and globalisation. He doesn't believe in climate change, and ditched  the Paris Agreement, in an effort to re-open mines and explore gas- and oil fields.  But history had taught us a lesson that  nativism, protectionism and isolationism are a toxic mix for economic and military disaster. The author - a neo-con foreign policy wonk - says a vacuum emerges with "a shift away from a US-dominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions." It is still too early to discern "what this alternative will be." It is true that "there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the US role." The EU is America's oldest ally, but it is far from being strong to lead the world. In fact without active US engagement in Europe, an aggressively revanchist Russia will step in, even though its "narrowly-based economy" is struggling. Western-led anctions and falling energy prices have taken a heavy toll on Russia's economy, but it doesn't deter Putin from staging a return to global power, focusing on Europe and the Middle East. China is seen as the only power that can challenge America's leadership. But it is "focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economic-growth rates to stave off popular unrest. China’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence, rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements." Beijing welcomed Trump's leaving the Trans-Pacific Partnership to expand its influence in the region. But. China will unlikely "use its influence to restrain North Korea," because it needs it as a buffer state between South Korea and its border. Despite huge influence on Pakistan, it's reluctant to help India and Pakistan reconcile. India has border disputes with both China  and Pakistan. The South China Sea is also another venue of territorial disputes between China and the littoral countries there.If the US gives up on its Asian allies such as the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, those countries may have no choice but to submit themselves to Beijing. Other US allies, such as Japan and India, may be forced to militarise and challenge China openly. Thus, an American withdrawal from the region could very well eventually bring on a military conflict there.The Middle East with its pertual conflicts sparked by the Shia/Sunni schism, pits the Shia-majority Iran against the Saudi-led Sunni coalition. Africa has been plagued by drought, population explosion, and the corrupt regimes have failed to address the social-economic woes, that easily lead to violence.The author points out that people, despite criticising the US "for what it was and what it was not," will one day look back with fondness the global order the America has secured. "They face the prospect of a world in which American leadership is likely to be less of a factor. It is far from clear that they are prepared for such a world, or that they will find themselves better off in it."  Read more

                I have a hard time listening to anyone who supported GWB's foreign excursions and who was the "coordinator for the future of Afghanistan".1) Asking NATO members to increase their share of defense spending is fair. They haven't been meeting their obligations.2) The Paris accord was never approved by Congress. Companies are free to continue moving towards green energy. 3) This author champions globalism and free trade as if it was a law of nature and not something that has both pros and cons. And while globalism has created jobs in the US and foreign companies employ Americans to produce goods that will be used in the US, the US has a trade deficit with  nearly every industrialized nation. Re-evaluating trade policies and looking to encourage companies to employ Americans is not a bad thing. As for this hyperbole "who will fill our shoes", get real. Russia and China have no interest in being the worlds police. The USA has squandered American wealth by injecting itself into countless unnecessary wars and crisis. We have poor relations with other countries because we cannot stop meddling. I look forward to a time where a country that has never been invaded by a foreign enemy stops spending $700B on "defense". Or at least rename it for what it is. A $700B budget for assaulting every nation in the free world that decided to do something we do not like. A multipolar world where the US is no longer dominate would be great. The US would act in a civilized manor and no longer need to waste endless amounts of money on "defense". Read more

                Dr Haass, a prominent US practitioner-turned-strategist, lays out the challenges flowing out of systemic transitional fluidity. However, the suggestion that the US-designed-and-led liberal order has been in place 'for three quarters of a century' ignores the fact that such an order has been much more shortlived than that. The USA, with the help of its allies and partners in the Second World War - which, incidentally, included Stalin's USSR and Chiang Kai-shek's China - established a multilateralist and collegial system of collective global governance via the San Francisco Conferences starting in late-1945. The UN, especially the UNSC and its veto-wielding P5 at its core - were fashioned to collaboratively manage the planet's post-War problems. But as the USA and the USSR charted their national-interest-focused and ideologically-driven courses, the P5 was much less effective than its early promise. The bipolarity cleaving the systemic core, formalised by NSC69 and the Korean War, ensured there were at least two hemispheric orders - the US-led capitalist West and the Soviet-led communist/socialist East, each challenging the other's leadership and reducing the planet to a battleground for their competing ideals and interests, with the world perennially shivering on the brink of thermonuclear catastrophe. The US-led OECD was the dominant political-economic aggregation of power in the world, but it only covered a small part of the planet. There was no world order for the US to lead until 1991.Soviet evisceration, effected via clandestine Sino-US strategic collaboration in Central America, Southern Africa and the Horn, South Asia, Indochina and, most spectacularly, Afghanistan, supplanted bipolarity at the systemic core with unipolarity. Although large swathes of the world's surface remained beyond its  ken, this post-Soviet era could accurately be generalised as the US-led liberal world order. But such orders last only as long as major players acquiesce in it and accept their own subordination to the primate. In late 1993, when the CPCCC and the CMC jointly identified the USA, Japan and the RoK as the source of the most acute threats to Chinese security, and began preparing to deter intervention, that voluntary subordination ended. In 1999, the DoD/ONA Summer Study similarly identified China as a 'constant competitor' and later, viewing it as a 'near-peer rival', America prepared to neutralise Chinese challenges to US primacy. By definition, the system was no longer unipolar. In a non-unipolar system, again by definition, there simply could not be a 'global order'. This is why it would be logical to state that the US-designed-and-led order acquired and retained its (virtually) global character between the end of 1991 when the USSR collapsed and the summer of 1993 when Beijing began girding itself against the systemic primate, and certainly by the end of 1999, when the Executive and Legislative Branches in Washington took policy-measures against China's challenges to American primacy, the 'globality' of the US-led order ended.So, when eminent analysts premise their analyses on assertions of a very shortlived US-led order as the global norm, then all inferences flowing from such analyses must, logically, be much more imperfect than the simple frailties of human cognition would warrant. This would be a difficult methodology for delivering practical policy options. Read more

                A somewhat US-centric and egotistical point of view with no great review of some of the problems the US has caused. As 43 million Americans are on food stamps perhaps global domination is not top of their agendaThe idea Macron can save France by saving the EU is somewhat detached from reality. It would be simple enough to save France by quitting the euro but that will not happen with MacronBTW US fertility rates are a problem and on a downward drift and standing at 1.85 per woman, 2.1 being needed for a stable population but hey dont let facts get in the way of a good story Read more

                The people of the US  got tired Mr. Haass, They got tired of the leaders sacrificing their interests for others "Because it was necessary for our allies". They got tired because they looked around realized since they didn't have to shoulder the burdens or sacrifices of guns or butter. We paid for the guns they got the butter. Secondly  and I am sure it is "coincidental" the well connected and powerful got very very rich by sacrificing the interests of the commoners. They did a wonderful thing   by letting China into the WTO....... for China and the rich but not for people who watched their jobs shipped off to china because Leadership means sacrifices must be made. Bluntly the withdrawal is because the commoners are so very tired of sacrifices. I would suggest Mr. Haass that if the sacrifices had been shared instead of strictly from those who had no voice in matters, there might be some support for playing a leadership role but there was not and if frankly let others pay the price for "Leadership" for has far as the commoner's are concerned we have payed way to much for "Global Leadership" and gained absolutly NOTHING!

Overview



In this dramatic new perspective on international affairs, Richard N. Haass, one of the country's most brilliant analysts and able foreign policy practitioners, argues that it is hard to overstate the significance of there being no major power conflict in the world. America's great military, economic, and political power discourages traditional challenges; no ideological fault line divides the world into warring blocs. India, China, Japan, Russia, and Europe all seek a prolonged period of stability that would support economic growth. The opportunity thus exists for unprecedented cooperation among the major powers. This is good, because they share vulnerabilities. Globalization, which promotes trade and investment and eases travel and communication, also facilitates the spread of viruses (human and computer alike), weapons, terrorists, greenhouse gases, and drugs. And the United States, for all its strength, cannot defeat these threats alone. But opportunity is not inevitability. The question is whether the United States will be able to integrate other countries into global efforts against terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons, genocide, and protectionist policies that jeopardize global economic prosperity. This compelling book explains why it must and how it can.

Richard Nathan Haass (born July 28, 1951) is an American diplomat. He has been president of the Council on Foreign Relations since July 2003, prior to which he was Director of Policy Planning for the United States Department of State and a close advisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. The Senate approved Haass as a candidate for the position of ambassador and he has been U.S. Coordinator for the Future of Afghanistan. He succeeded George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland to help the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which he received the State Department's Distinguished Service Award. At the end of 2003, Mitchell Reiss succeeded him as special envoy. In late 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland to chair inter-party talks aimed at addressing some of the unresolved issues from the peace process such as parades, flags and "the past".[3]

Early life and education[edit]




Richard Haass talks with President of Columbia University Lee Bollinger






Senator Jim Webb, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard N. Haass, former Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, former Senator John Warner, and journalist Andrea Mitchell at Ronald Reagan Centennial Roundtable in 2011


Haass was born in Brooklyn, the son of Marcella (née Rosenthal) and Irving B. Haass.[4][5] His family is Jewish.
Career[edit]
From 1989 to 1993, Haass was Special Assistant to United States President George H. W. Bush and National Security Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs. In 1991, Haass received the Presidential Citizens Medal for helping to develop and explain U.S. policy during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Previously, he served in various posts in the Department of State (1981–85) and the Department of Defense (1979–80).
Haass's other postings include Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz Visiting Professor of International Studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes Scholar, Haass obtained a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and went on to earn both a Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.[6]
Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, Haass advised several members of both the Republican Party and Democratic Party on issues regarding foreign policy, but did not publicly endorse a candidate due to the Council on Foreign Relations' non-partisan stance.[7]
In September 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland, with Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, to chair all party talks on flags, parades and the legacy of the Troubles, after violence flared over the removal of the union flag at Belfast City Hall. The talks broke up without reaching an agreement on December 31, 2013.[3]
Haass is the author of 12 books, of which 11 deal with matters of foreign policy and one with management.
Personal life[edit]
Haass lives in New York City with his wife, Susan Mercandetti,[8] and two children.
Foreign policy views[edit]
Haass most clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book The Reluctant Sheriff (1997). In his book, Haass argued that the United States should play the role of international sheriff. Maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff, one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks,” Haass writes (Haass 1997, 6). In other words, Haass called on the United States to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system. While Haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system, he also made it clear that he intended for the United States to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world. In the years ahead, “what will prove crucial is the ability of the United States to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the United States to act as a sheriff, to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges,” Haass notes (Haass 1997, 44).
After Haass completed The Reluctant Sheriff, he provided a bolder vision for U.S. foreign policy in his lecture “Imperial America” at the Atlanta Conference in November 2000. In his lecture, Haass argued that the leaders of the United States should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal American empire (Haass 2000). The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).
In a May 2015 interview with BBC's HARDtalk, speaking as President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history, in part due to the muting of U.S. dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and non-state entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism, and several policy failures, which may bring about an "era of disorder" in the absence of any clear superpower. The failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the notion that the Iraqi regime had any involvement with the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general, but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that Saddam Hussein's regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction, a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community "got wrong". He explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the "ill-advised" invasion of Iraq were compounded by subsequent errors, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops carried out under the Obama administration. Another major error, according to Haass, was the failure of the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the Syrian civil war, leaving room for the Islamic State to gain a foothold. He has also stated he was against U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War, but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable, better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled, resulting in a situation in which the people of Libya are "arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of Muammar Gaddafi." These seemingly incongruous positions, he argues, demonstrate that consistency, when it comes to foreign relations, "is a bad idea", and that each situation requires a custom-fit approach. Maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely non-interventionist foreign policy, for example, would be a mistake.[9]

Richard Nathan Haass (born July 28, 1951) is an American diplomat. He has been president of the Council on Foreign Relations since July 2003, prior to which he was Director of Policy Planning for the United States Department of State and a close advisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. The Senate approved Haass as a candidate for the position of ambassador and he has been U.S. Coordinator for the Future of Afghanistan. He succeeded George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland to help the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which he received the State Department's Distinguished Service Award. At the end of 2003, Mitchell Reiss succeeded him as special envoy. In late 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland to chair inter-party talks aimed at addressing some of the unresolved issues from the peace process such as parades, flags and "the past".[3]

Early life and education[edit]




Richard Haass talks with President of Columbia University Lee Bollinger






Senator Jim Webb, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard N. Haass, former Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, former Senator John Warner, and journalist Andrea Mitchell at Ronald Reagan Centennial Roundtable in 2011


Haass was born in Brooklyn, the son of Marcella (née Rosenthal) and Irving B. Haass.[4][5] His family is Jewish.
Career[edit]
From 1989 to 1993, Haass was Special Assistant to United States President George H. W. Bush and National Security Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs. In 1991, Haass received the Presidential Citizens Medal for helping to develop and explain U.S. policy during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Previously, he served in various posts in the Department of State (1981–85) and the Department of Defense (1979–80).
Haass's other postings include Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz Visiting Professor of International Studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes Scholar, Haass obtained a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and went on to earn both a Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.[6]
Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, Haass advised several members of both the Republican Party and Democratic Party on issues regarding foreign policy, but did not publicly endorse a candidate due to the Council on Foreign Relations' non-partisan stance.[7]
In September 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland, with Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, to chair all party talks on flags, parades and the legacy of the Troubles, after violence flared over the removal of the union flag at Belfast City Hall. The talks broke up without reaching an agreement on December 31, 2013.[3]
Haass is the author of 12 books, of which 11 deal with matters of foreign policy and one with management.
Personal life[edit]
Haass lives in New York City with his wife, Susan Mercandetti,[8] and two children.
Foreign policy views[edit]
Haass most clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book The Reluctant Sheriff (1997). In his book, Haass argued that the United States should play the role of international sheriff. Maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff, one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks,” Haass writes (Haass 1997, 6). In other words, Haass called on the United States to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system. While Haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system, he also made it clear that he intended for the United States to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world. In the years ahead, “what will prove crucial is the ability of the United States to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the United States to act as a sheriff, to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges,” Haass notes (Haass 1997, 44).
After Haass completed The Reluctant Sheriff, he provided a bolder vision for U.S. foreign policy in his lecture “Imperial America” at the Atlanta Conference in November 2000. In his lecture, Haass argued that the leaders of the United States should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal American empire (Haass 2000). The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).
In a May 2015 interview with BBC's HARDtalk, speaking as President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history, in part due to the muting of U.S. dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and non-state entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism, and several policy failures, which may bring about an "era of disorder" in the absence of any clear superpower. The failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the notion that the Iraqi regime had any involvement with the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general, but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that Saddam Hussein's regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction, a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community "got wrong". He explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the "ill-advised" invasion of Iraq were compounded by subsequent errors, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops carried out under the Obama administration. Another major error, according to Haass, was the failure of the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the Syrian civil war, leaving room for the Islamic State to gain a foothold. He has also stated he was against U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War, but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable, better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled, resulting in a situation in which the people of Libya are "arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of Muammar Gaddafi." These seemingly incongruous positions, he argues, demonstrate that consistency, when it comes to foreign relations, "is a bad idea", and that each situation requires a custom-fit approach. Maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely non-interventionist foreign policy, for example, would be a mistake.[9]

Richard Haass talks with President of Columbia University Lee Bollinger






Senator Jim Webb, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard N. Haass, former Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, former Senator John Warner, and journalist Andrea Mitchell at Ronald Reagan Centennial Roundtable in 2011


Haass was born in Brooklyn, the son of Marcella (née Rosenthal) and Irving B. Haass.[4][5] His family is Jewish.
Career[edit]
From 1989 to 1993, Haass was Special Assistant to United States President George H. W. Bush and National Security Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs. In 1991, Haass received the Presidential Citizens Medal for helping to develop and explain U.S. policy during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Previously, he served in various posts in the Department of State (1981–85) and the Department of Defense (1979–80).
Haass's other postings include Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz Visiting Professor of International Studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes Scholar, Haass obtained a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and went on to earn both a Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.[6]
Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, Haass advised several members of both the Republican Party and Democratic Party on issues regarding foreign policy, but did not publicly endorse a candidate due to the Council on Foreign Relations' non-partisan stance.[7]

The talks broke up without reaching an agreement on December 31, 2013.[3]
Haass is the author of 12 books, of which 11 deal with matters of foreign policy and one with management.
Personal life[edit]
Haass lives in New York City with his wife, Susan Mercandetti,[8] and two children.
Foreign policy views[edit]
Haass most clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book The Reluctant Sheriff (1997). In his book, Haass argued that the United States should play the role of international sheriff. Maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff, one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks,” Haass writes (Haass 1997, 6). In other words, Haass called on the United States to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system. While Haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system, he also made it clear that he intended for the United States to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world. In the years ahead, “what will prove crucial is the ability of the United States to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the United States to act as a sheriff, to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges,” Haass notes (Haass 1997, 44).
After Haass completed The Reluctant Sheriff, he provided a bolder vision for U.S. foreign policy in his lecture “Imperial America” at the Atlanta Conference in November 2000. In his lecture, Haass argued that the leaders of the United States should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal American empire (Haass 2000). The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).

Richard Nathan Haass (born July 28, 1951) is an American diplomat. He has been president of the Council on Foreign Relations since July 2003, prior to which he was Director of Policy Planning for the United States Department of State and a close advisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. The Senate approved Haass as a candidate for the position of ambassador and he has been U.S. Coordinator for the Future of Afghanistan. He succeeded George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland to help the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which he received the State Department's Distinguished Service Award. At the end of 2003, Mitchell Reiss succeeded him as special envoy. In late 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland to chair inter-party talks aimed at addressing some of the unresolved issues from the peace process such as parades, flags and "the past".[3]

Early life and education[edit]




Richard Haass talks with President of Columbia University Lee Bollinger






Senator Jim Webb, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard N. Haass, former Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, former Senator John Warner, and journalist Andrea Mitchell at Ronald Reagan Centennial Roundtable in 2011


Haass was born in Brooklyn, the son of Marcella (née Rosenthal) and Irving B. Haass.[4][5] His family is Jewish.
Career[edit]
From 1989 to 1993, Haass was Special Assistant to United States President George H. W. Bush and National Security Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs. In 1991, Haass received the Presidential Citizens Medal for helping to develop and explain U.S. policy during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Previously, he served in various posts in the Department of State (1981–85) and the Department of Defense (1979–80).
Haass's other postings include Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, the Sol M. Linowitz Visiting Professor of International Studies at Hamilton College, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A Rhodes Scholar, Haass obtained a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and went on to earn both a Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.[6]
Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, Haass advised several members of both the Republican Party and Democratic Party on issues regarding foreign policy, but did not publicly endorse a candidate due to the Council on Foreign Relations' non-partisan stance.[7]
In September 2013, Haass returned to Northern Ireland, with Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, to chair all party talks on flags, parades and the legacy of the Troubles, after violence flared over the removal of the union flag at Belfast City Hall. The talks broke up without reaching an agreement on December 31, 2013.[3]
Haass is the author of 12 books, of which 11 deal with matters of foreign policy and one with management.
Personal life[edit]
Haass lives in New York City with his wife, Susan Mercandetti,[8] and two children.
Foreign policy views[edit]
Haass most clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book The Reluctant Sheriff (1997). In his book, Haass argued that the United States should play the role of international sheriff. Maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff, one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks,” Haass writes (Haass 1997, 6). In other words, Haass called on the United States to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system. While Haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system, he also made it clear that he intended for the United States to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world. In the years ahead, “what will prove crucial is the ability of the United States to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the United States to act as a sheriff, to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges,” Haass notes (Haass 1997, 44).
After Haass completed The Reluctant Sheriff, he provided a bolder vision for U.S. foreign policy in his lecture “Imperial America” at the Atlanta Conference in November 2000. In his lecture, Haass argued that the leaders of the United States should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal American empire (Haass 2000). The United States should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them,” Haass argued (Haass 2000). Providing more details, he pointed to the British empire as his model. “The U.S. role would resemble 19th century Great Britain,” Haass explained (Haass 2000). By following the model of the British empire, Haass believed that the United States could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary. “Indeed, an American empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because American democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant, costly applications of military power,” Haass concluded (Haass 2000).
In a May 2015 interview with BBC's HARDtalk, speaking as President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history, in part due to the muting of U.S. dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and non-state entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism, and several policy failures, which may bring about an "era of disorder" in the absence of any clear superpower. The failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the notion that the Iraqi regime had any involvement with the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general, but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that Saddam Hussein's regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction, a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community "got wrong". He explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the "ill-advised" invasion of Iraq were compounded by subsequent errors, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops carried out under the Obama administration. Another major error, according to Haass, was the failure of the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the Syrian civil war, leaving room for the Islamic State to gain a foothold. He has also stated he was against U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War, but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable, better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled, resulting in a situation in which the people of Libya are "arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of Muammar Gaddafi." These seemingly incongruous positions, he argues, demonstrate that consistency, when it comes to foreign relations, "is a bad idea", and that each situation requires a custom-fit approach. Maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely non-interventionist foreign policy, for example, would be a mistake.[9]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
