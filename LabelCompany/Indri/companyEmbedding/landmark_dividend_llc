				Unit Exchange Program			

 


Free Lease Evaluation 1-844-722-0113



Unit Exchange Program

.
Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP (the “Partnership”), Landmark Dividend’s publicly-traded affiliate, has announced the rollout of its Unit Exchange Program (UEP), a product that allows property owners to contribute their infrastructure ground lease to the Partnership in exchange for common units in the Partnership.
Select features of the Unit Exchange program are as follows:

•	 	Units received by property owners under the program would be entitled to receive quarterly distributions announced by the Partnership on its common units.

•	 	Unlike a sale, the gains on the contributed ground lease may be tax-deferred because, in many cases, an exchange of property, such as a lease, for Partnership units does not immediately trigger gain in the property, similar in some ways to a 1031 (like-kind) exchange.

•	 	Ground lease property owners mitigate concentration risk on their infrastructure asset because they would be invested in a publicly-traded partnership currently owning over 1,400 leases from wireless carriers, outdoor advertising and renewable energy corporations.

“Our Unit Exchange Program offers compelling benefits for ground lease property owners with a cell tower, rooftop antenna, billboard, wind turbine or solar project on their property,” said Jeff Knyal, Vice Chairman of Landmark Dividend. “Not only is their rental income replaced with the distributions made by the Partnership, but the transaction itself may be tax-deferred and offers greater diversification than having an income stream from a single asset.”
To learn more about the Unit Exchange Program, please view the informational UEP video below. Links to download a two-page flyer and FAQs about the UEP are directly under the video box. Ground lease landlords can also contact Landmark Dividend at 1-844-722-0113 for more information.
The Partnership has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the offering. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the Partnership has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Partnership and the UEP. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Partnership will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-844-722-0113.
Any offering of UEP units will be made solely by means of the prospectus included in the registration statement and the related documents the Partnership has filed with the SEC.
About Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP
The Partnership is a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed to acquire, own and manage a portfolio of real property interests that the Partnership leases to companies in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries.  Headquartered in El Segundo, California, the Partnership’s real property interests consist of a diversified portfolio of long-term and perpetual easements, tenant lease assignments and fee simple properties located in 49 states and the District of Columbia, entitling the Partnership to rental payments from leases on more than 1,400 tenant sites.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
Statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties including, among others, that our business plans and assets may change as circumstances warrant.  Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  For more information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those conveyed in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  Any forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or of which the Partnership becomes aware, after the date hereof, unless required by law.

Cell Tower Lease
If you receive rent for a cell tower or rooftop antenna on your property, Landmark Dividend is interested in speaking to you.
You can take 100% control of your cell tower lease!
We have a great deal of experience in this sector because cell tower lease buyouts are the largest percentage of our business. In fact, our executive management team pioneered the cell tower lease buyout industry. We buy thousands of cellular leases every year, always providing a custom solution to the property owner.
Although rent reduction or decommissioning of your cell tower site is possible, the risk is statistically low. The far greater risk is opportunity cost. That means losing out on the opportunity to earn better growth from a financial asset. Applied to your cell tower lease, it means that investing the cash proceeds from the sale of your cell tower lease can often provide significantly stronger growth over the next 10, 20 or 30 years, compared to the cumulative monthly rent in that same time period.
The exciting news is that you can take 100% control of your cell tower lease’s value while simultaneously reducing risk. Landmark Dividend offers an immediate cash payment in exchange for your lease. Any future rent reduction or site decommissioning would not affect this transaction. No matter what happens to the lease on your property, you get to keep 100% of the proceeds from the sale of your cell tower lease. In addition, selling your lease does not in any way affect your ownership of your land, including the ability to sell it in the future.
What is your cell tower lease worth? Find out FREE!
Even if you don’t need cash right now, doesn’t it make sense to know the market value of your lease? If your site meets our criteria, we can provide you with a no-obligation analysis and valuation. Please call us at 1-844-722-0113 or click here to submit your information online so that we may contact you.

Fiber Optic Lease
If you have a ground lease for fiber optic cable that passes through your property, a data center or “carrier hotels” on your property or a fiber optic service agreement for your building, then Landmark Dividend is interested in speaking with you to determine the value of your lease. If your site qualifies, we will purchase your fiber optic lease agreement for a substantial cash payment.
Unlock the hidden value of your fiber optic lease today!
Although the risk of rent reduction or decommissioning of your fiber optic lease is low, it does exist. However, the far greater risk is your unrealized capital growth. Although ongoing rental income can seem to provide financial security, in the long-term taking a lump sum and reinvesting it can lead to greater personal wealth.
The exciting news is that you can realize the hidden value of your fiber optic lease while simultaneously eliminating risk. Landmark Dividend offers an immediate cash payment in exchange for your fiber optic lease.
Any future rent reduction or site decommissioning would not affect this transaction – you still keep 100% of the sale proceeds. In addition, selling your lease generally does not affect your ownership of your land, including the ability to sell it in the future.
We are one of the largest and most experienced ground lease acquisition companies in the nation, and the only one to be a general partner to a publicly-traded company, Landmark Infrastructure (NASDAQ: LMRK).
What is your fiber optic lease worth? Find out FREE!
Even if you don’t need cash right now, doesn’t it make sense to know the market value of your lease? If your site meets our criteria, we can provide you with a no-obligation analysis and valuation. Please call us at 1-844-722-0113 or click here to submit your information online so that we may contact you.

Landmark Dividend Announces Cellular Site Marketing and Development Division

Jan 05, 2015, 10:07 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Landmark Dividend LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Jan. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Landmark Dividend LLC, the nation's leader in ground lease acquisitions, has announced the roll out of a new division dedicated to the marketing and development of cellular tower sites. The goal of the new group is to help cellular tower landlords promote their locations to gain additional cellular carriers, and also assist them in executing these new lease transactions.
"Every year, wireless service carriers build new sites to alleviate coverage gaps and reduce strain on their over-taxed existing networks," said Landmark CEO Jeff Kynal. "Carriers work with companies like Landmark Dividend to locate sites within their markets. They want new sites that support their specific growth plans, satisfy their coverage requirements, and offer ease of zoning."
Due to the high cost of building new cellular tower locations, wireless carriers often seek agreements with competitors to place new cellular antennas on the competitors' existing cellular towers, which increases the monthly rent paid to land owners, building owners, churches, and municipalities who have a cellular tower on their property.
In working with Landmark Dividend, cellular site landlords don't need to worry about capital outlay or administrative overhead, and they have the option of receiving a significant lump sum payment from Landmark in lieu of monthly rental payments from the wireless carrier. Landmark can also collect and disperse rent payments and provide a range of other services. 
"Landmark Dividend is in an excellent position to help landlords generate more value from their cellular sites, whether towers or roof top locations," Kynal said. "We have strong relationships with all of the major wireless carriers, and as pioneers in the ground lease acquisition industry, we offer a high degree of knowledge and experience in putting together win-win transactions that benefit all parties involved."
Formed in El Segundo, CA in 2010, Landmark Dividend acquires ground leases on cellular towers, billboards and alternative energy infrastructures, such as wind turbines and solar farm tracks. It has offices throughout the United States, and also operates in Canada, Australia and Puerto Rico.
Landmark Dividend LLC is the national industry leader in ground lease acquisitions, providing value, capital and liquidity to qualified property owners of ground leases for cellular towers, billboards and alternative energy infrastructure. Our mission is to improve the financial position of our clients with strategic capital and outstanding service centered on knowledge, integrity and timely fulfillment. We offer a wide variety of products and services to our clients, from outright lease acquisition to long term financing. For more information on Landmark Dividend and to assess the value of your ground lease, go to www.LandmarkDividend.com.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
