David Field’s Midyear Letter to the Entercom Team
from Elissa Gomez
I am writing to provide you with my midyear update on Entercom and share my thoughts on how we are doing and where we are headed.  I am pleased to report that we had a great first half of 2016, achieving strong sales and financial growth and making significant progress in a number of areas to enhance our future.
Our steadfast focus on our core strategies and values is paying off.  We have never strayed from our fundamental belief that the key to success in this business is building great local radio brands, personalities and content; making Entercom a great place to work; adding powerful local marketing solutions for customers; and making a difference in our communities.  And the many millions of dollars we are investing in new people, brands, content, technology, capabilities, benefits and resources are paying off and enhancing our performance.
Allow me to share with you some of the highlights of our recent achievements:

Our stations are strong and growing.  Over the past couple years, our ratings are up double-digits, ranking #1 among all leading radio broadcasters.
Our revenues are strong and growing.  Not only have we been consistently #1 or #2 among all leading broadcasters over the past year, but we are also growing faster than many large growth companies, including Apple, Fed Ex, Verizon, Cisco, Ebay, Ralph Lauren, American Express, and many more.
We are financially strong and our stock is now at a six-year high, significantly outperforming the stock market over the past few years, a direct reflection of our solid performance and our increasingly bright prospects.   And as a reflection of our confidence in our future and our financial strength, we launched a dividend on our stock in June.
In recent months, we have added the Los Angeles Rams and San Diego Padres and some great local shows to our programming lineup.  We also expanded SmartReach Digital into several new markets.
We are rolling out a number of new world class tools to all of our markets, including SalesForce, a new video-based sales training system, and a number of enhancements to our digital platforms.
Our investment in programming innovation has led to exclusive Entercom programs with a number of world class artists, including Chris Martin, Justin Timberlake and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, with a number of other content innovation projects in the pipeline.
And our recent investment in an Entercom marketing team led by our first Chief Marketing Officer will make us a significantly stronger organization in the months and years to come.

While all of this should make us proud and excited about our future, we should also be proud of all the great things we are doing to make a difference for our listeners, our customers, our communities and for the people on the Entercom team.

Entercom stations continue to make a huge impact on the lives of our listeners and our communities in ways large and small.  Earlier this month, Johnny Dare and the team at the Rock in Kansas City raised life-saving funds for an elderly man in dire need of help.  That is just one example of the many extraordinary acts we perform throughout the year to make this world a better place.
Collectively, we generate well over $100 million per year in support for wonderful organizations and needy individuals across the country.  And we continue to reduce our environmental footprint, working to be a good corporate citizen to help ensure a sustainable planet for our children and grandchildren.
And close to 200 members of our team have already signed up for our new Entercom Stock Purchase Plan which will enable participants to buy our stock at roughly $2 below its market value.   And well over 100 of the recent graduates on our team have signed up for our Student Loan Payment Assistance Plan.

And the news on Radio remains excellent.  As we all know, last year Nielsen declared Radio to be the #1 Reach Medium in the country, surpassing TV over the past year as millennials (and others) are cutting the TV cord in record numbers.   And while competitive media are suffering severe disruption from declining usage, DVR’s, digital fraud and blocking technologies, etc., Radio stands tall as the least disrupted and highest ROI medium in the nation.
Radio is winning because we establish powerful personal connections with our listeners, providing top notch entertainment, information, engagement, and companionship to the massive 93% of the population that listens weekly.  As Sir Richard Branson explains, “People want personality, local insight, and a feeling of connection – all qualities great DJ’s on radio stations can share, and streaming sites can’t duplicate”.
We should all feel very good about our recent performance.   But as we take pride in our accomplishments and progress, we also recognize that in this hypercompetitive world of constant change, any organization that isn’t getting better every day will ultimately fall behind and fail.  What was good enough to win yesterday, won’t be good enough tomorrow.  As a company, we are making huge investments in people, content, capabilities, and other important areas to ensure that we grow, thrive and succeed in the years ahead.  And as individuals, each of us must also commit ourselves to advancing our knowledge, skills, and capabilities in order to keep pace or risk falling behind.  We should all heed the words of the late, great Vince Lombardi who said, “We will chase perfection, and we will chase it relentlessly, knowing all the while we can never attain it.  But along the way, we shall catch excellence.”
My deepest thanks and appreciation to each of you for all of your contributions to our collective success during the first half of 2016.  I am grateful to be able to serve you and lead this special organization of terrific people that is positioned for great things in the years ahead.
With all best wishes,
David

Doing Our Part


ENERGY-EFFICIENT LIGHTING PROGRAM
Each market conducted a lighting assessment, implemented a comprehensive change-out program replacing incandescent bulbs with CFL or LED lighting, and developed systems to reduce energy consumption.
PAPER SAVING SYSTEMS
All Entercom markets use 100% post-consumer recycled paper and changed printing methods to utilize PDF files, e-faxing, and e-invoicing to reduce paper use.
RECYCLING
All offices recycle aluminum, glass, plastic, toner cartridges, as well as paper, and each desk has an individual bin for paper recycling.
KITCHEN AND BATHROOM AREAS
Entercom uses no disposable cups, plates, or flatware. Reusable items are available, paper supplies should be recycled, and all coffee and tea are certified organic and/or fair trade.
ELECTRONIC OFFICE EQUIPMENT
Entercom implemented best practices on shutting down computers and other equipment, screen savers, power strips, and disposal of old equipment.




TEMPERATURE SETTINGS
All heaters are set at 68, air conditioners at 72, water heaters below 110 and refrigerators at 37. Markets that do not currently have “smart” HVAC systems are investigating the possibility of attaining them.
OFFICE CLEANING
All products used for cleaning are “green.”
VEHICLE PROCUREMENT
All markets are working to reduce vehicle fleets and when a new vehicle is needed, purchasing a hybrid or best-in-class energy-efficient vehicle.
$5 MILLION IN ENVIRONMENTAL GRANTS
Entercom made $3 million in combined advertising grants to Conservation International, The Wilderness Society and 350.org. In addition, each Entercom market selected a local environmental organization they wanted to support and partnered with them on PSAs. The list includes the Charles River Conservancy in Boston and the Energy Center in Wisconsin to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation in Norfolk and the Wild Salmon Center in Portland. In total, these grants reflect another $1 million in donated airtime. Entercom also donated $1 million worth of free airtime to the Environmental Defense Fund

History[edit]
Joseph M. Field founded Entercom on October 21, 1968, on the conviction that FM broadcasting, then in its infancy, would eventually surpass AM broadcasting as the leading radio band.[3]
During the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the ownership of multiple radio stations were eased, beginning with the introduction of duopoly rules, which allowed a company to own two stations in each radio band. Entercom took advantage of the change to expand its presence in the markets where it already operated. In April 1995, the company paid $24.5 million for three stations in Portland, Oregon, acquiring KGON, a classic rock station; KFXX, an all-sports station; and KMUZ-FM, a modern rock station.[3][4]
At that time, David Field, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who started with the company in 1987, was the VP of Operations and CFO. He was appointed President and CEO in 2002.[5] Over the years, Field has been frequently interviewed in Billboard magazine about various radio industry topics.[6][7]
In January 1999, Entercom went public in an IPO in which it raised around $236 million.[3] In July 1999, the company purchased 43 radio stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for $821.5 million in cash.[8] It was Entercom's largest deal to date.[9] The deal included stations in eight markets, Kansas City, MO.; Milwaukee; New Orleans, LA; Memphis, TN.; Buffalo, NY.; Norfolk, VA; and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA. The deal more than doubled both the number of stations under the company's control, and the number of markets in which it had stations. The acquisition made Entercom the fifth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, with 88 stations in 17 markets.[9][10] That year, Entercom announced that it would direct its radio stations not to play songs that promoted violence.[11][12]
On August 21, 2006, Entercom agreed to buy 15 mid-market stations from CBS Radio. Locations included Austin, TX; Cincinnati, OH; Memphis, TN; and Rochester, NY.[13] However, due to ownership limitations set by the FCC, Entercom had to sell off three of its stations in the Rochester market; these were acquired by Stephens Media Group.[14] Shortly after the transaction, the company exited the Cincinnati market by trading all four of its stations in Cincinnati and three of its stations in Seattle in exchange for three stations in San Francisco in a deal with Bonneville Broadcasting.[15] A year later, Entercom was investigated for payola and fined $4.45 million by the FCC.[10][16][17][18]
In 2007, Entercom station KDND was sued after a participant in a "Hold Your Wee For a Wii" contest held by the station's morning show died of water intoxication.[19]
In May 2014, Entercom announced its launch of SmartReach Digital product line focused on creating digital marketing options for small and medium businesses.[20]
On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media for $105 million; the deal gave the company 14 additional stations in Atlanta, GA; Denver, CO; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA. To comply with FCC ownership limits in the Denver market and DOJ antitrust concerns, Entercom entered into an exchange agreement with Bonneville under which Entercom exchanged four stations in Denver for Classic Rock station The Sound in Los Angeles and $5 million in additional consideration. The stations Entercom exchanged with Bonneville were KOSI-FM, KYGO-FM, KKFN-FM and KEPN-AM. Entercom previously owned KOSI-FM, while the remaining stations were acquired through the acquisition of LFM.
Entercom and Bonneville began operating the exchanged stations under time brokerage agreement (TBAs) once the LFM transaction was completed.[21][22] In November 2015, the swap deal was closed successfully.[23]
In October 2016, Entercom announced that it would acquire four radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Beasley Broadcast Group for $24 million in cash. The deal closed in January, 2017 and WBT AM/FM, WLNK-FM and WFNZ-AM joined Entercom.[24]
On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced that it had agreed to merge with CBS Radio. The purchase will give Entercom operations in 23 of the top 25 markets, and make it the second-largest owner of radio stations in the United States, behind only iHeartMedia.[25] To comply with federal ownership caps, Entercom plans to divest at least 15 stations. The company also announced that it would shut down KDND and return its license to the FCC to "facilitate the timely FCC approvals for the planned combination with CBS Radio"; the FCC had designated that the renewal of KDND's license would be subject to a hearing over allegations it had failed to operate in the public interest.[19]
Brands[edit]
In addition to Entercom's 127 radio stations, Entercom operates multiple brands, including 1Thing, Entercom's sustainability initiative and GetMyPerks, Entercom's eCommerce platform. The company also provides a suite of digital marketing solutions for businesses through its SmartReach Digital product suite.[26][20]

History[edit]
Joseph M. Field founded Entercom on October 21, 1968, on the conviction that FM broadcasting, then in its infancy, would eventually surpass AM broadcasting as the leading radio band.[3]
During the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the ownership of multiple radio stations were eased, beginning with the introduction of duopoly rules, which allowed a company to own two stations in each radio band. Entercom took advantage of the change to expand its presence in the markets where it already operated. In April 1995, the company paid $24.5 million for three stations in Portland, Oregon, acquiring KGON, a classic rock station; KFXX, an all-sports station; and KMUZ-FM, a modern rock station.[3][4]
At that time, David Field, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who started with the company in 1987, was the VP of Operations and CFO. He was appointed President and CEO in 2002.[5] Over the years, Field has been frequently interviewed in Billboard magazine about various radio industry topics.[6][7]
In January 1999, Entercom went public in an IPO in which it raised around $236 million.[3] In July 1999, the company purchased 43 radio stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for $821.5 million in cash.[8] It was Entercom's largest deal to date.[9] The deal included stations in eight markets, Kansas City, MO.; Milwaukee; New Orleans, LA; Memphis, TN.; Buffalo, NY.; Norfolk, VA; and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA. The deal more than doubled both the number of stations under the company's control, and the number of markets in which it had stations. The acquisition made Entercom the fifth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, with 88 stations in 17 markets.[9][10] That year, Entercom announced that it would direct its radio stations not to play songs that promoted violence.[11][12]
On August 21, 2006, Entercom agreed to buy 15 mid-market stations from CBS Radio. Locations included Austin, TX; Cincinnati, OH; Memphis, TN; and Rochester, NY.[13] However, due to ownership limitations set by the FCC, Entercom had to sell off three of its stations in the Rochester market; these were acquired by Stephens Media Group.[14] Shortly after the transaction, the company exited the Cincinnati market by trading all four of its stations in Cincinnati and three of its stations in Seattle in exchange for three stations in San Francisco in a deal with Bonneville Broadcasting.[15] A year later, Entercom was investigated for payola and fined $4.45 million by the FCC.[10][16][17][18]
In 2007, Entercom station KDND was sued after a participant in a "Hold Your Wee For a Wii" contest held by the station's morning show died of water intoxication.[19]
In May 2014, Entercom announced its launch of SmartReach Digital product line focused on creating digital marketing options for small and medium businesses.[20]
On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media for $105 million; the deal gave the company 14 additional stations in Atlanta, GA; Denver, CO; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA. To comply with FCC ownership limits in the Denver market and DOJ antitrust concerns, Entercom entered into an exchange agreement with Bonneville under which Entercom exchanged four stations in Denver for Classic Rock station The Sound in Los Angeles and $5 million in additional consideration. The stations Entercom exchanged with Bonneville were KOSI-FM, KYGO-FM, KKFN-FM and KEPN-AM. Entercom previously owned KOSI-FM, while the remaining stations were acquired through the acquisition of LFM.
Entercom and Bonneville began operating the exchanged stations under time brokerage agreement (TBAs) once the LFM transaction was completed.[21][22] In November 2015, the swap deal was closed successfully.[23]
In October 2016, Entercom announced that it would acquire four radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Beasley Broadcast Group for $24 million in cash. The deal closed in January, 2017 and WBT AM/FM, WLNK-FM and WFNZ-AM joined Entercom.[24]
On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced that it had agreed to merge with CBS Radio. The purchase will give Entercom operations in 23 of the top 25 markets, and make it the second-largest owner of radio stations in the United States, behind only iHeartMedia.[25] To comply with federal ownership caps, Entercom plans to divest at least 15 stations. The company also announced that it would shut down KDND and return its license to the FCC to "facilitate the timely FCC approvals for the planned combination with CBS Radio"; the FCC had designated that the renewal of KDND's license would be subject to a hearing over allegations it had failed to operate in the public interest.[19]
Brands[edit]
In addition to Entercom's 127 radio stations, Entercom operates multiple brands, including 1Thing, Entercom's sustainability initiative and GetMyPerks, Entercom's eCommerce platform. The company also provides a suite of digital marketing solutions for businesses through its SmartReach Digital product suite.[26][20]

How To YieldBoost Entercom Communications Corp To 9.4% Using Options
Shareholders of Entercom Communications Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2018 covered call at the $12.50 strike and collect the premium based on the 45 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 6.5% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 9.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $12.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but ETM shares would have to climb 24.4% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 28.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Noteworthy Thursday Option Activity: ETM, DLR, AMBC
Looking at options trading activity among components of the Russell 3000 index, there is noteworthy activity today in Entercom Communications Corp , where a total volume of 1,955 contracts has been traded thus far today, a contract volume which is representative of approximately 195,500 underlying shares (given that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares). That number works out to 69.6% of ETM's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 280,890 shares.

May 11, 2017 11:29 AM EDT









Short Interest Makes 36.3% Move For ETM
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 730,124 share increase in total short interest for Entercom Communications Corp , to 2,740,885, an increase of 36.31% since 04/13/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

History[edit]
Joseph M. Field founded Entercom on October 21, 1968, on the conviction that FM broadcasting, then in its infancy, would eventually surpass AM broadcasting as the leading radio band.[3]
During the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the ownership of multiple radio stations were eased, beginning with the introduction of duopoly rules, which allowed a company to own two stations in each radio band. Entercom took advantage of the change to expand its presence in the markets where it already operated. In April 1995, the company paid $24.5 million for three stations in Portland, Oregon, acquiring KGON, a classic rock station; KFXX, an all-sports station; and KMUZ-FM, a modern rock station.[3][4]
At that time, David Field, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who started with the company in 1987, was the VP of Operations and CFO. He was appointed President and CEO in 2002.[5] Over the years, Field has been frequently interviewed in Billboard magazine about various radio industry topics.[6][7]
In January 1999, Entercom went public in an IPO in which it raised around $236 million.[3] In July 1999, the company purchased 43 radio stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for $821.5 million in cash.[8] It was Entercom's largest deal to date.[9] The deal included stations in eight markets, Kansas City, MO.; Milwaukee; New Orleans, LA; Memphis, TN.; Buffalo, NY.; Norfolk, VA; and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA. The deal more than doubled both the number of stations under the company's control, and the number of markets in which it had stations. The acquisition made Entercom the fifth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, with 88 stations in 17 markets.[9][10] That year, Entercom announced that it would direct its radio stations not to play songs that promoted violence.[11][12]
On August 21, 2006, Entercom agreed to buy 15 mid-market stations from CBS Radio. Locations included Austin, TX; Cincinnati, OH; Memphis, TN; and Rochester, NY.[13] However, due to ownership limitations set by the FCC, Entercom had to sell off three of its stations in the Rochester market; these were acquired by Stephens Media Group.[14] Shortly after the transaction, the company exited the Cincinnati market by trading all four of its stations in Cincinnati and three of its stations in Seattle in exchange for three stations in San Francisco in a deal with Bonneville Broadcasting.[15] A year later, Entercom was investigated for payola and fined $4.45 million by the FCC.[10][16][17][18]
In 2007, Entercom station KDND was sued after a participant in a "Hold Your Wee For a Wii" contest held by the station's morning show died of water intoxication.[19]
In May 2014, Entercom announced its launch of SmartReach Digital product line focused on creating digital marketing options for small and medium businesses.[20]
On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media for $105 million; the deal gave the company 14 additional stations in Atlanta, GA; Denver, CO; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA. To comply with FCC ownership limits in the Denver market and DOJ antitrust concerns, Entercom entered into an exchange agreement with Bonneville under which Entercom exchanged four stations in Denver for Classic Rock station The Sound in Los Angeles and $5 million in additional consideration. The stations Entercom exchanged with Bonneville were KOSI-FM, KYGO-FM, KKFN-FM and KEPN-AM. Entercom previously owned KOSI-FM, while the remaining stations were acquired through the acquisition of LFM.
Entercom and Bonneville began operating the exchanged stations under time brokerage agreement (TBAs) once the LFM transaction was completed.[21][22] In November 2015, the swap deal was closed successfully.[23]
In October 2016, Entercom announced that it would acquire four radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Beasley Broadcast Group for $24 million in cash. The deal closed in January, 2017 and WBT AM/FM, WLNK-FM and WFNZ-AM joined Entercom.[24]
On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced that it had agreed to merge with CBS Radio. The purchase will give Entercom operations in 23 of the top 25 markets, and make it the second-largest owner of radio stations in the United States, behind only iHeartMedia.[25] To comply with federal ownership caps, Entercom plans to divest at least 15 stations. The company also announced that it would shut down KDND and return its license to the FCC to "facilitate the timely FCC approvals for the planned combination with CBS Radio"; the FCC had designated that the renewal of KDND's license would be subject to a hearing over allegations it had failed to operate in the public interest.[19]
Brands[edit]
In addition to Entercom's 127 radio stations, Entercom operates multiple brands, including 1Thing, Entercom's sustainability initiative and GetMyPerks, Entercom's eCommerce platform. The company also provides a suite of digital marketing solutions for businesses through its SmartReach Digital product suite.[26][20]

Entercom is a publicly traded American broadcasting company based in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1968, it is the fourth-largest radio company in the United States, owning 127 radio stations across 28 media markets.[2]

History[edit]
Joseph M. Field founded Entercom on October 21, 1968, on the conviction that FM broadcasting, then in its infancy, would eventually surpass AM broadcasting as the leading radio band.[3]
During the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the ownership of multiple radio stations were eased, beginning with the introduction of duopoly rules, which allowed a company to own two stations in each radio band. Entercom took advantage of the change to expand its presence in the markets where it already operated. In April 1995, the company paid $24.5 million for three stations in Portland, Oregon, acquiring KGON, a classic rock station; KFXX, an all-sports station; and KMUZ-FM, a modern rock station.[3][4]
At that time, David Field, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who started with the company in 1987, was the VP of Operations and CFO. He was appointed President and CEO in 2002.[5] Over the years, Field has been frequently interviewed in Billboard magazine about various radio industry topics.[6][7]
In January 1999, Entercom went public in an IPO in which it raised around $236 million.[3] In July 1999, the company purchased 43 radio stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for $821.5 million in cash.[8] It was Entercom's largest deal to date.[9] The deal included stations in eight markets, Kansas City, MO.; Milwaukee; New Orleans, LA; Memphis, TN.; Buffalo, NY.; Norfolk, VA; and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA. The deal more than doubled both the number of stations under the company's control, and the number of markets in which it had stations. The acquisition made Entercom the fifth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, with 88 stations in 17 markets.[9][10] That year, Entercom announced that it would direct its radio stations not to play songs that promoted violence.[11][12]
On August 21, 2006, Entercom agreed to buy 15 mid-market stations from CBS Radio. Locations included Austin, TX; Cincinnati, OH; Memphis, TN; and Rochester, NY.[13] However, due to ownership limitations set by the FCC, Entercom had to sell off three of its stations in the Rochester market; these were acquired by Stephens Media Group.[14] Shortly after the transaction, the company exited the Cincinnati market by trading all four of its stations in Cincinnati and three of its stations in Seattle in exchange for three stations in San Francisco in a deal with Bonneville Broadcasting.[15] A year later, Entercom was investigated for payola and fined $4.45 million by the FCC.[10][16][17][18]
In 2007, Entercom station KDND was sued after a participant in a "Hold Your Wee For a Wii" contest held by the station's morning show died of water intoxication.[19]
In May 2014, Entercom announced its launch of SmartReach Digital product line focused on creating digital marketing options for small and medium businesses.[20]
On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media for $105 million; the deal gave the company 14 additional stations in Atlanta, GA; Denver, CO; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA. To comply with FCC ownership limits in the Denver market and DOJ antitrust concerns, Entercom entered into an exchange agreement with Bonneville under which Entercom exchanged four stations in Denver for Classic Rock station The Sound in Los Angeles and $5 million in additional consideration. The stations Entercom exchanged with Bonneville were KOSI-FM, KYGO-FM, KKFN-FM and KEPN-AM. Entercom previously owned KOSI-FM, while the remaining stations were acquired through the acquisition of LFM.
Entercom and Bonneville began operating the exchanged stations under time brokerage agreement (TBAs) once the LFM transaction was completed.[21][22] In November 2015, the swap deal was closed successfully.[23]
In October 2016, Entercom announced that it would acquire four radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Beasley Broadcast Group for $24 million in cash. The deal closed in January, 2017 and WBT AM/FM, WLNK-FM and WFNZ-AM joined Entercom.[24]
On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced that it had agreed to merge with CBS Radio. The purchase will give Entercom operations in 23 of the top 25 markets, and make it the second-largest owner of radio stations in the United States, behind only iHeartMedia.[25] To comply with federal ownership caps, Entercom plans to divest at least 15 stations. The company also announced that it would shut down KDND and return its license to the FCC to "facilitate the timely FCC approvals for the planned combination with CBS Radio"; the FCC had designated that the renewal of KDND's license would be subject to a hearing over allegations it had failed to operate in the public interest.[19]
Brands[edit]
In addition to Entercom's 127 radio stations, Entercom operates multiple brands, including 1Thing, Entercom's sustainability initiative and GetMyPerks, Entercom's eCommerce platform. The company also provides a suite of digital marketing solutions for businesses through its SmartReach Digital product suite.[26][20]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
