February 10, 2010 By Alisha ANGSTRON PARENT COMPANY PATENTS NEW CLASS OF SUPERIOR NANO GRAPHENE SUPERCAPACITOR ELECTRODE MATERIALS
02.10.2010
DAYTON, Ohio—(February 10, 2010) Nanotek Instruments, parent company of Angstron Materials Inc., has been issued U.S. Patent 7,623,340 for its development of a new high-performing class of meso-porous nanocomposites. The new nanocomposite provides a superior supercapacitor electrode material for uses that include hybrid electric vehicles (EVs), transportation and energy storage. The technology is based on the company’s breakthrough discovery of nano graphene platelets (NGPs). Angstron, the world leader in production of NGPs, will make the nanocomposite material.
The NGP-based nanocomposite exhibits high levels of capacitance and electrical conductivity as well as demonstrating chemical stability and low mass density. Both NGPs and NGP-based nanocomposites can be mass produced cost-effectively when compared to carbon nano-tubes and fibers. Supercapacitors containing this advanced material offer the potential to supplement a battery used in an electric car to provide bursts of power needed for rapid acceleration. Until now, this critical requirement has been the largest technical hurdle to making battery-powered cars commercially viable.
In addition, supercapacitors must also be able to store sufficient energy to provide an acceptable driving range. The new NGP-based material makes it possible for a supercapacitor to meet weight and cost targets while combining adequate energy and power with a long cycle life. Angstron will provide the meso-porous NGP nanocomposites in two forms: NGPs coated with a thin layer of conducting polymer or surface functional groups and NGPs bonded by a conductive binder, coating, or matrix material such as a polymeric carbon. The platelets in these products are comprised of a sheet of graphite plane or multiple sheets of graphite plane with a thickness less than 10 nm and an average length, width, or diameter smaller than 500 nm. The binder or matrix material bonded to the platelets to form the nanocomposite material create a surface area greater than 500 m.sup.2/gm.
Angstron Materials leads the industry as the only advanced materials company to offer large quantities of both pristine graphene and oxidized graphene. Multi-layer graphene, both pristine and oxidized versions, are collectively referred to as nano graphene platelets (NGPs).

December 17, 2009 By Alisha Angstron Materials Inc., a world leader in the production of nano graphene platelets (NGPs), has been awarded 1.494 million to develop processes for mass-producing chemically modified (“functionalized”) NGPs for a nearly limitless number of applications in the aerospace, energy, defense, automotive and telecommunications markets.   Angstron was selected for the award by the U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Part of NIST’s Technology Innovation Program (TIP), the award will be matched by other funding sources.
The award will generate more high-tech jobs for Dayton and position Angstron as a commercialization leader for breakthrough NGP-based products with its patented technology and manufacturing processes.  TIP selected Angstron based on its capability to accelerate development of nano graphene, an advanced material considered critical to potential growth in U.S. manufacturing. “We’ll also be able to help industries that currently need and use carbon nanotubes, but would benefit from higher performance and a lower cost,” said Dr. Bor Jang, CEO and Co-Founder of Angstron.
Angstron developed NGPs as an alternative to carbon nanotubes, which are difficult to disperse in plastic and often have purity issues—not to mention the cost factor. NGPs have been shown to have striking material properties; among other things, it has the highest intrinsic strength and the highest thermal conductivity of all existing materials as well as exceptional in-plane electrical conductivity (up to ~ 20,000 S/cm)and electron mobility that is 100 times faster than silicon.
The ability to chemically functionalize these NGPs in a continuous, cost-effective manner is the
next step to broad implementation of this high performing material. “We are actively looking for partners interested in jointly developing methods to incorporate NGPs into products that require  critical performance features and could provide a competitive advantage in today’s global market,” said Jang.
Application examples include the ability to use NGPs in aviation against lightening strikes or in fuel tanks.  The material can be modified to become semi-conducting or insulated when needed.  Angstron’s work supports other aerospace needs such as integration of NGPs in thin films or coatings for EMI shielding, electrostatic spray painting, and conductive adhesives as well as composites and thermal management applications.  Work is also underway to integrate NGPs in several energy storage and conversion products, such as high-capacity lithium-ion batteries, high-capacity supercapacitors, fuel cells, wind turbine blades, lubricants and solar cells.
Angstron’s project goals under the award will focus on two primary objectives  The advanced materials company will develop methods for mass-producing functionalized NGPs through the development of scalable surface treatment procedures for both pristine graphene and graphene oxide platelets.  Angstron will also develop an in-depth understanding of the relationships between processing, shape and structure changes and performance in NGPs and NGP-containing devices or composites for both functional and load-bearing applications.

July 1, 2009 By Alisha Dayton-based Angstron Materials, a developer and manufacturer of nanotechnology solutions, will produce a new type of advanced materials at its north Dayton facility and expand its workforce there.
Angstron has developed a new class of nanomaterial commonly referred to as NGPs (nano graphene platelets), a cost effective yet high quality alternative to carbon nanotubes (CNT).
The company, located at 1240 McCook Avenue, will add 27 full-time jobs to its existing staff of four by mid-2011. The jobs will pay an average annual salary of $47,000.
An NGP is a nanoscale platelet composed of one or more layers of graphene plane (with a thickness of 0.34 nm to 100 nm). Single-sheet NGPs have demonstrated a much higher thermal conductivity and twice the specific surface areas when compared with single-walled CNTs. NGPs offer potential for greater performance in a wide range of applications and markets including renewable energy, aerospace, automotive, marine, electronics, construction, medical and telecommunications. Angstron’s nano-graphene material is protected by 18 US patents and several international patents, issued and pending.

May 2, 2009 By Alisha Angstron Materials Inc has developed nano graphene platelets (NGPs) as a cost effective, high performance alternative to carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Angstron is the first company to isolate single-layer and multi-layer graphene structures and successfully produce nano graphene sheets in large quantities. Exhibiting the highest intrinsic strength and thermal conductivity known today, NGPs offer a variety of other performance advantages.
A nanoscale platelet is composed of one or more layers of graphene plane (with a thickness of 0.34 nm
to 100 nm). Angstron’s engineered NGPs are available in several forms from powders and nano-intermediates (NGP dispersions and master batches), to NGP-enhanced nanocomposites. NGPs can be mixed with other nano materials such as carbon nano-fibers (CNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nano clay platelets, to produce hybrid nanocomposites.
Angstron’s nano graphene material is also able to reinforce polymer materials including thermoset, thermoplastics and elastomers. Melt and solution processing techniques typically used for plastics such as injection molding and extrusion can be used to process NGP-polymer composites.
CNTs and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have shown similar enhanced thermal, mechanical and electrical performance properties when compared to NGPs but these carbon products cannot be easily dispersed into other materials making end use applications challenging and high loading percentages nearly impossible. NGPs have been demonstrated to produce thin films with high loading up to 40 percent. In addition, NGPs are 50 times stronger than steel with a surface area twice that of CNTs
Testing of NGPs and NGP nanocomposites have demonstrated the following features and benefits:
NGPs are especially suited to Lithium Ion (Li-ion) battery, fuel cell and conductive composite applications as well as the aerospace, automotive, energy, marine, electronics, construction, medical and telecommunications markets.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
