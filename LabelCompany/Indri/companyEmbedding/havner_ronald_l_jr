			Mr. Havner, 59, has been a director of the Company since September 2014. Mr. Havner is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Public Storage, a publicly traded real estate investment trust that primarily acquires, develops, owns and operates self storage facilities, where he also served as President from 2002 through 2016. He was elected Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Public Storage in 2002 and was elected Chairman of the Board in August 2011. Mr. Havner has been Chairman of the Board of PS Business Parks, Inc., a publicly traded real estate company, since March 1998, and has served as a director of California Resources Corp., a publicly traded oil and natural gas exploration and production company, since 2014. Mr. Havner was the 2014 Chairman of the Board of Governors of NAREIT.
In considering the nomination of Mr. Havner for re?election to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board considered whether Mr. Havner's role at Public Storage and PS Business Parks, together with his service on the Board of California Resources Corp., would allow him to dedicate sufficient time and focus on his duties as a director of AvalonBay. The Board considered Mr. Havner's performance as a valued and reliable member of the Board and its Committees over the past year, including his 100% attendance at Board and Committee meetings during 2016. In accordance with the Board's standard practice, Mr. Havner reviews three years' of regularly scheduled AvalonBay Board and Committee meeting dates so that he has time to arrange his schedule to provide for availability at AvalonBay meetings.
In determining that Mr. Havner's other commitments would not prevent him from dedicating sufficient time and attention to the Company, the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee considered the substantial overlap between his duties at Public Storage and at PS Business Parks. Public Storage owns a significant percentage of PS Business Parks, PS Business Parks' financial records are reflected in Public Storage's financial statements under the equity method of accounting, and there are a number of contractual relationships between the two entities, including a cost sharing and administration services agreement.
The Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee also believe that Mr. Havner provides great value to the Board and is an important contributor to discussions and decision-making. Mr. Havner is a highly respected and experienced member of the real estate industry with current executive experience with a leading developer and operator. Accordingly, the Board has concluded that Mr. Havner should serve as a director based upon his business and investment expertise acquired in successfully leading an equity REIT for over a decade and his demonstrated reliability and commitment to service on the Board

Deceptive Business Practices... Bait and switch… Fraudulent Conversion… Unlawful Auctions of people’s belongings…” with more law suits on the way.
“Public Storage is conscientiously ruining people's lives with an array of illegal actions and auctions.” say’s the attorney heading a team of lawyers in Los Angeles.  Their fraudulent actions  are sparking law suits from angry customers all over the country.  If you Google ‘Public Storage Lawsuits’,  you will find dozens and dozens of current law suits have been filed against Ronald L. Havner Jr ‘s company, Public Storage.

2015 CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AGAINST RONALD L. HAVNER'S PUBLIC STORAGE:  http://www.laartsdistrictblogs.com/ClassActionAgainstPublicStorage.pdf  ALSO SEE: http://www.PublicStorageLitigation.com  “Of course I blame the head of the company!” the angry Los Angeles based artist goes on… “Ronald L. Havner Jr. is the fucking CEO! He damn well knows what’s going on! I’ll put it this way… He’s either a brain dead moron too stupid to know how his company does business, or more likely, the sleazy self centered conductor of their daily orchestrated scams and blatant perversion of the law with their fuzzy math! They are scamming people on so many levels! The people that run Public Storage like the plastic phony, Margaret Sommers are sleazy conscienceless predators that politely smile as they steal everything you own and then thank you for being their customer. I’ll bet Ronald doesn't get many return customers! I only want to see them again in court! Or better yet, behind bars!! That’s my experience with Public Storage.”   “You know that scum bag makes almost 10 million a year!” referring to Ronald Havner. “It’s no wonder!” The angry artist goes on... “He’s a fucking corporate thief! And he’s lining his pockets with people’s lives! Bait and switch! Fraudulent Conversion! Unlawful Auctions! Public Storage is being sued all over the country! And now I’m in line to sue them too! What Ronald L. Havner Jr. and his sleazy plastic minions like Margaret Sommers are doing to people like me is disgusting! And I’ll be damned if I’m going to take what they did lying down! His illegal and blatantly predatory business practices have literally ruined my life and many others. And speaking for myself, I’m going to make him pay for it! Almost 50 years of my original Photography and my original art is just gone like it was nothing! Because it was nothing to Ronald L. Havner Jr. or the conscienceless crony minions like Margaret Sommers who Ronald has running Public Storage as district managers! These people are mindless robots!“   “ Public Storage literally just destroyed my life as an artist! As a professional photographer since high school, I literally had hundreds of thousands of copyrighted and irreplaceable negatives, transparencies, original prints, years of tear sheets from the hundreds of jobs I’ve done are all gone! Not to mention all of my original paintings from the 80’s to now, GONE! All my equipment, Gone!! My entire studio was in that space! They sold my entire life away to a total stranger as if it was nothing! All my personal business and medical records and family belongings as well! Almost 50 years of my life! Those fucking thieves stole my entire life away and they won’t even tell me who they sold it to! I don’t even have a picture of my mother anymore! Everything in my life is gone! Ronald L. Havner Jr. is going to pay for that. What he has put me through I only wish on him!”   “Ronald L. Havner and his organized band of sleazy Public Storage cronies stole everything I owned as if they had the right! THEY DIDN’T!” he insists! “It was a blatantly illegal auction! And I have the best lawyer in the country for the job! He’s already sued Public Storage multiple times and just filed a class action suit against them last month! After examining all of the fuzzy math Public Storage tries to get away with everyday in my own paper work, my new attorney quickly determined they fucked up big time!! My auction was illegal as were many other things they did almost from moment one! Bait and switch, Fraudulent Conversion, unlawful auction! That’s what they do to innocent people who have come there to safely store their most important belongings! They are disgusting! They have illegally ruined my life as an artist as if they had the right! THEY DIDN’T! And I will see them in court. And I guarantee we’ll be suing for a lot more then the 10K ceiling they think they can force on people they hurt! You violated the law and your own contract! You think you can hold me to a contract you yourself violated?”   “Hey Ron... How much is 40 plus years of my life worth, if your life is worth almost 10K a year? Think about it, you sleazy thieving corporate asshole!”   -J.A. Citizen  http://www.facebook.com/PublicStorageSleazyThieves

Sleazy is, as sleazy does.  And Ronald L. Havner Jr. and his gang of thieving minions seem to be very invested in injecting a lot of blatantly illegal and predatory actions into their sleazy business, "Public Storage". They are hurting the "public" with their blatantly illegal scams on a daily basis!

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
