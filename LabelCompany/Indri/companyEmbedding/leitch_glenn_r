Jennie-O president to retire, Glenn R. Leitch named next president of Willmar-based turkey processing company

By news@wctrib.com
 on Oct 19, 2011  at 9:10 a.m.





AUSTIN -- Robert Tegt will retire at the end of the year as president of Jennie-O Turkey Store of Willmar and as a Hormel Foods group vice president, according to a Hormel Foods news release.

 
 "Under his leadership, the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand has become no. 1 in brand awareness in the turkey category," said Jeff Ettinger, Hormel's chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, said in the release. "We wish Bob and his wife, Kay, the best in retirement." A Hormel Foods employee for more than 30 years, Tegt joined the company as a sales trainee in 1973, according to his official bio. He served in a number of sales positions and was named product manager in the meat products division in 1979. Six years later, he became group product manager for the meat products group and was named vice president of marketing for Jennie-O Foods in 1988. In 2001, he was promoted to senior vice president of the foodservice business for Jennie-O Turkey Store. He advanced to vice president of the specialty foods group in January 2006, was promoted to group vice president of the specialty foods group in November 2007 and assumed his current responsibilities in 2008. Glenn R. Leitch has been named to replace Tegt as president of Jennie-O Turkey Store. Leitch was also named as a group vice president at Hormel Foods. Leitch began his career as director of commodity sales at Jennie-O Turkey Store in 1996. He was promoted to senior vice president of commodity and supply division in 2001. He was named general manager in 2011. Jennie-O Turkey Store is a turkey processing company based in Willmar. The company is owned by Hormel Foods Corporation of Austin, a multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer-branded food and meat products. -- Staff reports
