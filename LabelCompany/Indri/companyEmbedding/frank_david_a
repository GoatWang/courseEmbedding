Cosmetic surgery is about correcting an aspect of the body that someone is either not happy with or for medical reasons. These surgeries are very popular, but they have risks. Therefore, it is important to understand all the steps involved in a cosmetic surgery procedure before going under the knife.

Before having plastic surgery, get full information about the possible complications from the operation. Your cosmetic surgeon will more than likely discuss these potential complications with you before the operation. It is important for you to be aware of them. Some of the complications may include for example swelling, infection, increased blood pressure, and even death although only in rare cases.
 
All good cosmetic surgeons will have a book with pictures of their previous jobs. Be sure to take a look at the before and after pictures so you can see the quality of your doctor’s work. This also gives you additional input for making decisions about your own changes.
 
If you get surgery to enlarge your breasts, unfortunately you run the risk of being unable to catch breast cancer early. The reason that many women survived breast cancer is that they were able to self-examine themselves regularly. When breasts are surgically changed, this type of self-test is no longer fully reliable. As you heal, scar tissue can form, which also makes it hard to determine if there is a lump.
 
You need to know that breast implants can disturb your natural development when you are still under 20 years of age. Wait a few years until you are older and fully-grown before seriously thinking about new breasts; if you get implants when still too young, they even may not work, and you will regret your decision.
 
There is no guarantee that you will have perfect breasts after the surgery. Breast augmentation has its imperfections. Your doctor can easily increase your breasts, but the sizing may not be symmetrical. There are patients who can feel and see the breast implant through their skin after the surgery.
 
When planning to have a boobs job, be careful when selecting your new cup size. Not many cosmetic surgeons can change breasts to a particular cup size; but they are able without difficulty to change breasts to look natural, or seem more dramatic. Speak to your cosmetic surgeon about the look you want, and not about a particular cup size, and you will be happier with the outcome.
 
If you are contemplating a breast augmentation, be cautious about getting breasts that are too large for your body. A small woman will look unnatural with huge breasts, and additionally she may suffer from back pain as well. It is better to select new breasts that look more natural and feel comfortable. This will also help with your satisfaction about the boobs in the long term.
 
Plan how to take care of your body after the surgery. If you plan to have a serious cosmetic surgery, like breast implants, rhinoplasty or even a tummy tuck, it is very much recommended to plan the time after the surgery. Cosmetic surgery is major surgery and needs proper recovery time. Take time off from work, avoid excessive physical exercise and give yourself sufficient time to recover from the operation.





Cosmetic Procedures: Botox and Rhinoplasty

Posted on August 28, 2015  by  user 


Many people come to the realization that they are unhappy with the way they look. For some, a solution to this problem is cosmetic surgery. When done correctly, cosmetic surgery can make anyone look how they desire. When done wrong, patients can be left with less than stellar results to say the least.
Botox
There are a lot of minimal invasive cosmetic surgery procedures to improve one’s appearance. For example, the drug Botox can help alleviate and erase the signs of aging. One of the main Botox uses is to remove lines and wrinkles such as frown lines. The average cost for a Botox treatment in the US is around $500.
 
You have to remember that over time, your cosmetic surgery could become obvious as you age. Maybe you saw other people who had Botox treatments and certain surgeries which visibly stand out more as their body naturally ages around the areas that had surgery. Are you able to gracefully age after having had a cosmetic procedure?
 
If you find ever more wrinkles in your face and the use of various creams and anti-aging lotions is no longer doing the trick, you should contemplate Botox injections. They are a quick and painless procedure to reduce immediately the appearance of your wrinkles. They do not cause scarring, and your face will look younger in no time!
 
Don’t be disappointed or alarmed if you don’t see any noticeable changes in your face right after you received the Botox injections. It can take up to a full week before you begin to see the full effects of it.
Rhinoplasty
A cosmetic surgery to correct a nose is called rhinoplasty. It is one of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures. The surgeon can make the nose smaller or bigger or even completely change the shape of the tip or bridge of the nose. Rhinoplasty can be used to repair an injury on your nose, a breathing problem or a birth defect.
 
Even small changes of the nose can dramatically improve the looks of patients. Rhinoplasty can be done with incisions, which are made entirely inside the nostrils, or through a small incision in the columella; which is the tissue between the nostrils.
 
A lot of teens want a nose job to create the perfect nose. On average the cost of a nose job in the United States is around $4,000. While this price may seem high to you, the advantages to your teen’s self-esteem are worth it.
 
If you want to get a rhinoplasty surgery, but cannot afford the high price of it in the US, you should consider going abroad, for example to India. It will cost about 30% less and there are doctors available who trained in the US and are therefore very qualified to perform the surgery.
 
Think about what will happen following your procedure. Some cosmetic surgeries are more invasive and taxing than others, therefore give careful consideration to your after care. Do not make the mistake of dismissing these as simple procedures as they are not. Ensure that you tell your boss about the necessary recovery time. Also keep your close friends and family members informed, so that they can support you with anything if needed.

4.0 out of 5 starsbut also sent by Frank's superior to spy on himByZelda's Zooon September 7, 2014A different type of detective novel.  Frank became a wolf, as you can see from the cover, about six years ago.  He has trouble holding on to a partner, having lost 12 in six years.  A young rookie is the 13th partner, but also sent by Frank's superior to spy on him.  This is truly a detective novel, however, and not of a paranormal genre.  The detectives interview witnesses, seek clues, and get in trouble.  They see the seedy side and the political side of Boston.The writing is colorful.  As with the rookie cop, Frank grew on me the more I understood him.  The rookie changed and steadily loses is idealism for the real world and what it takes to make it.It is sad that this is the only book and not more to continue in the series.

3.0 out of 5 starsI survived this bookByCynthia Echterlingon July 12, 2013I love the concept of this book, a werewolf detective and all the problems that creates. Frank is a very interesting character as is the narrator caught between liking Frank and doing his job which is to watch for him to get int trouble. That whole set up is wonderful and so is all the little wolfish bits and Franks struggle with them, but the plot didn't really have much punch to it. I felt kind of "Yeah, and..." Which was a big disappointment because I really liked the characters.

Neskeon December 22, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI really liked how the author creates a world that is ours, but just enough askew to keep you on your toes for what might be next.  Werewolf cop? Given.  Mysterious mafiosi? Done.  Surviving Frank puts the 'werewolf' in the 'lone-wolf' cop story.  Join Frank and his new partner for a fun ride through a Boston that you may recognize, but will also be surprised by. Great characters and lots of fun await with inside jokes as well as twists and turns that will keep you going till the end.0Comment|
