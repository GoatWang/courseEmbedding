Over his four decade career with the firm, and as a partner for 30 years, Mr. Leamon established a reputation as a leading client service professional with hands-on experience in the financial services, consumer products, manufacturing, technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) industries.  He created and served in a series of new roles and structures with worldwide reach, serving as the first-ever Global Managing Director of Tax & Legal Services; Clients & Markets, with responsibility for overseeing programs directed towards all segments of the firm's client portfolio; Merger & Acquisition Services; and Services, responsible for leadership and oversight of Deloitte's core businesses (Audit, Tax, Consulting, Financial Advisory).
Mr. Leamon served as Chair of Deloitte's Global Innovation Network, leading a group of 25 partners from around the world focused on helping the firm identify and act on emerging client service-related issues, opportunities, and technologies.  He was also founder and Vice Chair of the Deloitte Center for Cross-Border Investment, which promoted a focus on marketplace issues and thought leadership with respect to cross-border investment and transactions.
