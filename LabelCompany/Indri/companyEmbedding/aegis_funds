All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
*Other fees and commissions apply to a WellsTrade® account. For complete information on fees and commissions refer to the WellsTrade® Account Commissions and Fee Schedule on wellsfargo.com

Monthly Payments



The Loan Amount is a function of LTV and a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of 1.2x. DSCR is calculated by taking portfolio net income (not including interest expense) and dividing by your loan's interest expense.
For instance, if portfolio net income (excluding interest expense) is $140,000 and interest expense is $100,000 then the DSCR is 1.4x.
In certain cases, the loan amount shown will be lower than what is implied by your desired LTV value. 
This is because the portfolio cashflows do not support the interest expense at your desired LTV level.  
As a result, the loan amount needs to be reduced so the DSCR is greater than or equal to 1.2x.

Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. For performance data current to the most recent month end, please call us at 800-528-3780.  Performance data does not reflect the redemption fee, which would have reduced the total return. Performance data for the AVFAX shares with load reflects the Class A maximum sales charge of 3.75%. Additionally, performance for the Class A Shares without load is shown at NAV, and does not reflect the maximum sales charge. If reflected, total return would be reduced.

	Investors



					Overview			
Here at Aegis Funding, our trust deeds are secured against real estate assets with a protective equity position (difference in value to loan amount).  What this means to investors is, in the unlikely event that we have to foreclose on a home, the proceeds collected on resale would be sufficient to pay all interest due to investors, all fees and real estate commissions.  Our investors are seeing performing returns from 9-13% annually.  We, the founders of Aegis, invest heavily in these products and we underwrite every loan as if we were funding it personally. 
If you or anyone you know is interested in learning more about trust deed investing contact us today. 
 
We also have a Mortgage Pool; Aegis Asset Backed Securities, LLC
 
If you're considering investing in trust deeds, but desire more diversification, liquidity, and flexibility, a mortgage pool investment could be right for you. Much like a mutual fund, a mortgage pool is a portfolio of real estate loans funded collectively by multiple investors, each purchasing shares in the pool. Interest payments are paid out proportionately as monthly dividends. By allowing an investor to spread their investment across all the loans in the fund, mortgage pools offer greater diversification than investing in individual trust deeds.* 
 
Benefits of Mortgage Pool Investing
 
Diversification. By allowing an investor to share in multiple trust deeds, mortgage pool investing provides significant diversification within the investor's trust deed position - further reducing risk. 
 
Convenience. Mortgage pools allow investors to invest in multiple trust deeds with the bookkeeping convenience of a single investment. What's more, there is no need to reinvest capital returned when loans are paid off - it's automatically reinvested in new loans as long as your investment in the fund remains active. (This is one reason that a mortgage pool can be a great option for Self Directed IRAs – we have excellent resources for self-directed custodians).
 
Dividend reinvestment. Because monthly interest payments are distributed to shareholders as dividends, investors have the option to reinvest their yields automatically and compound their investment.
 
Liquidity. Investment in individual trust deeds are locked in until the loan matures - but, shares of a mortgage pool can typically be sold at any time after 24 months after the initial investment date.  In special circumstances we are able to liquidate shares early, as long as the exit is not to the detriment of the pool as a whole or the other investors in the pool.
 
Mortgage Pool Properties 
 
Aegis Funding, a division of Aegis Realty underwrites all loans funded with the same scrutiny as we would with our own money, in-fact principals Jason Moore and Kip Adkins have over 1.5MM invested in the Aegis Asset Backed Securities pool.  All loans are secured and recorded on California Real Estate, limiting our lending efforts on regions in which we have significant experience helps us manage risk. 
 
Investor Suitability Standards
 
The one limiting factor in our mortgage pool is that we require all new investors to be accredited investors, meaning, a total net worth of $1,000,000 (excluding principal residence) or an annual income of $200,000 (for an individual) or $300,000 (for a couple) is required. We ask that you provide a letter from your investment banker or tax preparer certifying that you meet these requirements. 
 
Other Things You Should Know
 
While our mortgage pools have risks like any investment, and past performance is no guarantee of future performance, you may be interested to know that our pools have consistently delivered yields from 9-12% on average since inception. We are also proud that we engage David Allen Dunner, CPA to independently audit our pools on behalf of our investors. We originate and service our loans with the assistance of “The mortgage Office” software, the leading technology platform in private money.

Our stated goal with AABS is to Preserve your Capital through Equity Protection and to return a preferred rate of 9%. 
Equity Protection is attained through strict underwriting practices by the AABS fund manager. Loans are chosen for the fund based on a Loan-To-Value ratio which is often more stringent than a bank. The fund manager also oversees the origination and servicing of all loans in the fund, and is in direct contact with the borrower at all times.
The AABS fund manager monitors monthly loan payments and all other contingencies related to each loan in the fund.
AABS is hands on, from Origination to Pay-Off, which means Capital Preservation through Equity Protection for your investment.
By investing in AABS, you partner with us, and as a partner you are vested in all Trust Deeds owned by the fund.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household

The Loan Amount is a function of LTV and a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of 1.2x. DSCR is calculated by taking portfolio net income (not including interest expense) and dividing by your loan's interest expense.
For instance, if portfolio net income (excluding interest expense) is $140,000 and interest expense is $100,000 then the DSCR is 1.4x.
In certain cases, the loan amount shown will be lower than what is implied by your desired LTV value. 
This is because the portfolio cashflows do not support the interest expense at your desired LTV level.  
As a result, the loan amount needs to be reduced so the DSCR is greater than or equal to 1.2x.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
