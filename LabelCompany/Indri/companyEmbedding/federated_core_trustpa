CONFIDENTIAL PRIVATE OFFERING MEMORANDUM

Part A
(information required in a prospects) 

February 28, 2002 (Revised July 31, 2002) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read this Confidential Private Offering Memorandum carefully before      
investing and retain it for future reference. It contains important information 
about the Portfolio that investors should know before investing.                

A copy of a Subscription Agreement and Investor Questionnaire for use in        
subscribing to purchase shares of the Portfolio accompanies delivery of this    
Memorandum. In order to purchase shares of the Portfolio, a prospective         
investor must satisfactorily complete, execute and deliver the Subscription     
Agreement and Investor Questionnaire to the Portfolio's Placement Agent.        

Items 1,2 3, 5 and 9 of Part A are omitted pursuant to Item B(2)(b)of the       
General Instructions to Form N-1A.                                              

Investment Objective, Principal Investment Strategies and Related Risks         

Investment Objective                                                            
The investment objective of the Portfolio is to seek high current income. While 
there is no assurance that the Portfolio will achieve its investment objective, 
it endeavors to do so by following the strategies and policies described in     
this offering memorandum.                                                       

Investment Strategy                                                       
The Portfolio provides exposure to the high-yield, lower-rated corporate bond   
market. At least 65 percent of the Portfolio's assets are invested in corporate 
bonds rated BBB or lower. The Adviser actively manages the Portfolio seeking to 
realize the potentially higher returns of high-yield bonds (also known as "junk 
bonds") compared to returns of high-grade securities by seeking to minimize     
default risk and other risks through careful security selection and             
diversification.                                                                

The Adviser selects securities seeking high yields, low relative credit risk,   
and high portfolio diversification. If the issuer of a bond is unable to make   
all coupon and principal payments as promised, realized yields will be less     
than promised. The securities in which the Portfolio invests have high yields   
primarily because of the market's greater uncertainty about the issuer's        
ability to make all required interest and principal payments, and therefore     
about the returns that will be in fact be realized by the Portfolio.            

The Adviser attempts to select bonds for investment by the Portfolio which      
offer superior potential returns for the default risks being assumed. The       
Adviser's securities selection process consists of a credit-intensive,          
fundamental analysis of the issuing firm. The Adviser's analysis focuses on the 
financial condition of the issuing firm, together with the issuer's business    
and product strength, competitive position, and management expertise. Further,  
the Adviser considers current economic, financial market, and industry factors, 
which may affect the issuer.                                                    

The Adviser attempts to minimize the Portfolio's credit risk through            
diversification. The Adviser selects securities to maintain broad portfolio     
diversification both by company and industry.                                   

Because the Portfolio refers to high-yield bond investments in its name, it     
will notify shareholders in advance of any change in its investment policies    
that would enable the Portfolio to normally invest less than 80% of its assets  
in fixed-income investments rated below investment grade.                       

Securities and Techniques                                                       

Fixed Income Securities                                                         
The Portfolio invests primarily in lower-rated corporate fixed income           
securities. Corporate fixed income securities are debt securities issued by     
U.S. or foreign businesses. Notes, bonds, debentures and commercial paper are   
the most prevalent types of corporate debt securities. The Portfolio may also   
purchase interests in bank loans to companies.                                  

The Portfolio treats preferred stock which is redeemable by the issuer as a     
fixed income security. Preferred stocks have the right to receive specified     
dividends or distributions before the issuer makes payments on its common       
stock. Some preferred stock also participates in dividends and distributions    
paid on common stock.                                                           

The Portfolio may invest in fixed income securities of issuers based outside    
the U.S. The securities of foreign issuers in which the Portfolio invests are   
primarily traded in the U.S. and are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. 

Fixed income securities pay interest, dividends or distributions at a specified 
rate. The rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted           
periodically. In addition, the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the 
principal amount of the security, normally within a specified time.             

A security's yield to maturity will increase or decrease depending upon whether 
it costs less (a discount) or more (a premium) than the principal amount.       

The credit risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers. In     
addition, the credit risk of an issuer's debt securities may vary based on      
their priority for repayment. For example, higher-ranking (senior) securities   
have a higher priority than lower ranking (subordinated) securities. This means 
that the issuer might not make payments on subordinated securities while        
continuing to make payments on senior securities. Typically, both senior and    
subordinated debt securities have a higher priority than redeemable preferred   
stock. Most of the fixed income securities in which the Portfolio invests will  
be uncollateralized and subordinated to other debt that a corporation has       
outstanding.                                                                    

Lower rated fixed income securities are securities rated below investment grade 
(i.e., BB or lower) by a Nationally Recognized Rating Service. There is no      
minimal acceptable rating for a security to be purchased or held by the         
Portfolio and the Portfolio may purchase or hold unrated securities and         
securities whose issuers are in default.                                        

Temporary Defensive Investments                                                 
The Portfolio may temporarily  depart from its principal  investment  strategies
by investing its assets in cash, cash items,  and  shorter-term,  higher quality
debt securities and similar  obligations.  It may do this to minimize  potential
losses and maintain  liquidity to meet  shareholder  redemptions  during adverse
market  conditions.  This may cause the Portfolio to give up greater  investment
returns to  maintain  the safety of  principal,  that is,  the  original  amount
invested by shareholders.                                                       

Investment Risks                                                                

Credit Risks                                                                    
Credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by     
failing to pay interest or principal when due. If an issuer defaults, the       
Portfolio will lose money. The high yield bonds in which the Portfolio invests  
have a higher default risk than investment grade securities. Low-grade bonds    
are almost always uncollateralized and subordinated to other debt that a firm   
has outstanding.                                                                

Many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services such as       
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. These services assign     
ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of issuer default. Lower      
credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk. If a security has not received 
a rating, the Portfolio must rely entirely upon the Adviser's credit assessment.

Fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying  
interest at a higher rate.  The difference between the yield of a security and  
the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a comparable maturity (the spread)   
measures the additional interest paid for risk. Spreads may increase generally  
in response to adverse economic or market conditions. A security's spread may   
also increase if the security's rating is lowered, or the security is perceived 
to have an increased credit risk. An increase in the spread will cause the      
price of the security to decline relative to higher quality instruments.        

Liquidity Risks                                                                 
Trading opportunities are more limited for fixed income securities that have    
not received any credit ratings, have received ratings below investment grade   
or are not widely held.  These features may make it more difficult to sell or   
buy a security at a favorable price or time. Consequently, the Portfolio may    
have to accept a lower price to sell a security, sell other securities to raise 
cash or give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative   
effect on the Portfolio's performance. Infrequent trading of securities may     
also lead to an increase in their price volatility.                             

Bond Market Risks                                                               

Prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest rate    
changes for similar securities. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of  
fixed income securities fall.                                                   

Interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed income        
securities with longer durations. Duration measures the price sensitivity of a  
fixed income security to changes in interest rates.                             

Risks Related to the Economy                                                    
Like equity securities, the prices of high-yield securities are affected by the 
economy, which is keyed to current and anticipated developments in the U.S. and 
global economy                                                                  

Management Organization and Capital Structure                                   

Investment Adviser

Portfolio Manager                                                               
Mark E. Durbiano has been the Portfolio's portfolio manager since inception. He

Shareholder Information                                                         

Beneficial  interests in the Portfolio  are issued  solely in private  placement
transactions  which do not involve any "public  offering"  within the meaning of
Section  4(2) of the  Securities  Act of 1933  (1933  Act).  Investments  in the
Portfolio may only be made by investment  companies,  insurance company separate
accounts,  common or commingled trust funds or similar organizations or entities
that are "accredited  investors"  within the meaning of Regulation D of the 1933
Act. This Confidential  Private Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer
to sell,  or the  solicitation  of an offer to buy,  any  "security"  within the
meaning of the 1933 Act.                                                        

Pricing of Portfolio Shares                                                     
The net  asset  value  (NAV) of the  Portfolio  is  determined  as of the end of
regular trading (normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) each day the NYSE is open.  

The NAV per share of the  Portfolio  is computed  by  dividing  the value of the
Portfolio's  assets,  less  all  liabilities,  by the  total  number  of  shares
outstanding.                                                                    

Purchase of Portfolio Shares                                                    
Shares of the  Portfolio  may be purchased  any day the New York Stock  Exchange
(NYSE) is open.                                                                 

Purchases  should  be made in  accordance  with  procedures  established  by the
Transfer Agent.                                                                 

Purchase  orders  for  Shares  of  the  Portfolio  will  receive  the  NAV  next
determined  after  the  purchase  order  is  received  in  proper  form  by  the
Portfolio's Transfer Agent, Federated Shareholder Services Company.             

Payment by federal  funds  must be  received  by the  Trust's  custodian,  State
Street Bank and Trust  Company,  by 3:00 p.m.  (Eastern  time) the next business
day following the receipt of the purchase order.                                

There is no minimum required initial or subsequent investment amount.           

The  Portfolio  reserves  the  right  to  cease  accepting  investments  in  the
Portfolio at any time or to reject any investment order.                        

Redemption of Portfolio Shares                                                  
Shares of the Portfolio may be redeemed any day the NYSE is open.               

Redemption requests should be made in accordance with procedures  established by
the Transfer Agent.                                                             

Redemption  requests will receive the NAV next  determined  after the request is
received in proper form by the Transfer Agent.                                  

Redemption  proceeds will normally be delivered  within one business day after a
request is received in proper form. Payment may be delayed up to seven days:    

o     to allow a purchase order to clear;                                       
o     during periods of market volatility; or                                   
o     when a  shareholder's  trade  activity  or amount  adversely  impacts  the
Portfolio's ability to manage its assets.                                 

Redemption in Kind                                                              
Although the Portfolio intends to pay Share redemptions in cash, it reserves    
the right to pay the redemption price in whole or in part by a distribution of  
the Portfolio's portfolio securities.                                           

Confirmations and Account Statements                                            
Shareholders  will  receive  confirmation  of  purchases  and  redemptions.   In
addition,  shareholders will receive periodic  statements  reporting all account
activity including dividends paid. The Trust will not issue share certificates. 

Dividends and Distributions                                                     
The Portfolio  declares  dividends daily and pays them monthly to  shareholders.
Purchases made by wire begin earning  dividends on the day the wire is received.
Purchases  made by check begin  earning  dividends on the business day after the
Portfolio  receives the check. In either case,  dividends are earned through the
day a redemption request is received.                                           

Dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested  in  additional  Shares unless the
shareholder has elected cash payments.                                          

Tax Consequences                                                                
Portfolio  distributions are taxable to the shareholder  whether paid in cash or
reinvested in the Portfolio.  Dividends are taxable as ordinary income;  capital
gains are  taxable  at  different  rates  depending  upon the length of time the
Portfolio holds its assets.                                                     

Portfolio  distributions  are expected to be both  dividends and capital  gains.
Redemptions are taxable sales.

the Portfolio accompanies delivery of this Memorandum. In order to purchase     
shares of the Portfolio, a prospective investor must satisfactorily complete    
and execute the Subscription Agreement and deliver it to the Portfolio's        
Transfer Agent.

General Instructions to Form N-1A.                                              

Investment Objective, Principal Investment Strategies and Related Risks         

Investment Objective                                                            
The investment objective of the Portfolio is to provide total return. While     
there is no assurance that the Portfolio will achieve its investment objective, 
it endeavors to do so by following the strategies and policies described in     
this offering memorandum.                                                       

Investment Strategy                                                             
The Portfolio pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in  
mortgage backed securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations       
(CMOs).                                                                         

The Adviser manages the portfolio by targeting a dollar weighted average  
duration relative to that of the Lehman Brothers Mortgage Backed Securities     
Index. Duration measures the price sensitivity of a portfolio of fixed income   
securities to changes in interest rates. The Adviser targets this range based   
upon its interest rate outlook. The Adviser formulates its interest rate        
outlook by analyzing a variety of factors, such as:                             

o     current and expected U.S. economic growth,                                

o     current and expected interest rates and inflation,                        

o     the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, and                          

o     changes in the supply of or demand for U.S. government securities.        

The Adviser generally shortens the portfolio's average duration when it   
expects interest rates to rise and extends the duration when it expects         
interest rates to fall.                                                         

The Adviser selects securities used to lengthen or shorten the portfolio's
average duration by comparing the returns currently offered by different        
investments to their historical and expected returns. In selecting mortgage     
backed securities, including CMOs, the analysis also focuses on the expected    
cash flows from the pool of mortgage obligations supporting the security. The   
Adviser attempts to assess the relative returns and risks of these securities   
by analyzing how the timing, amount and division of cash flows from the pool    
might change in response to changing economic and market conditions. The        
Adviser may use CMOs with more predictable cash flows (such as sequential pay,  
planned amortization class and targeted amortization class) to improve the      
Portfolio's performance in volatile markets. The Adviser may also use           
combinations of CMOs or CMOs and pass-through certificates to provide a higher  
yielding investment with market risks similar to a pass-through certificate or  
a Treasury security. The combination may involve different mortgage pools.      
Unanticipated differences in prepayment rates of the pools may reduce the       
return of the combined investment. Combinations may also include CMOs (such as  
IOs, POs, and inverse floaters) that have complex terms or less predictable     
cash flows.                                                                     

  In addition to buying mortgage backed securities outright, the Portfolio may
acquire securities on a "to be announced" basis in order to enhance yield. The  
Portfolio engages in dollar roll transactions to increase income. The Portfolio 
uses repurchase agreements to secure its obligations in these transactions.     

   Because the Portfolio refers to mortgage investments in its name, it will
notify shareholders in advance of any change in its investment policies that    
would enable the Portfolio to normally invest less than 80% of its assets in    
mortgage investments.                                                           

Securities and Techniques                                                       

Fixed Income Securities                                                         
Fixed income securities pay interest,  dividends or distributions at a specified
rate.  The  rate  may  be a  fixed  percentage  of  the  principal  or  adjusted
periodically.  In  addition,  the issuer of a fixed income  security  must repay
the principal  amount of the security,  normally within a specified time.  Fixed
income securities provide more regular income than equity  securities.  However,
the returns on fixed income  securities are limited and normally do not increase
with the issuer's  earnings.  This limits the  potential  appreciation  of fixed
income securities as compared to equity securities.                             

A  security's  yield  measures  the  annual  income  earned on a  security  as a
percentage  of  its  price.  A  security's   yield  will  increase  or  decrease
depending  upon whether it costs less (a discount) or more (a premium)  than the
principal  amount.  If the issuer may redeem the security  before its  scheduled
maturity,  the price and yield on a  discount  or  premium  security  may change
based  upon the  probability  of an early  redemption.  Securities  with  higher
risks generally have higher yields.                                             

The  following  describes  the  types of fixed  income  securities  in which the
Portfolio principally invests:                                                  

Agency Securities                                                         
   Agency  securities  are  issued or  guaranteed  by a federal  agency or other
   government  sponsored  entity  acting under  federal  authority (a GSE).  The
   United  States  supports  some GSEs with its full,  faith and  credit.  Other
   GSEs receive support through federal  subsidies,  loans or other benefits.  A
   few GSEs have no  explicit  financial  support,  but are  regarded  as having
   implied support  because the federal  government  sponsors their  activities.
   Agency securities are generally  regarded as having low credit risks, but not
as low as treasury securities.                                            

   The Portfolio treats mortgage backed securities  guaranteed by GSEs as agency
   securities.  Although a GSE guarantee  protects against credit risks, it does
   not reduce the interest rate and prepayment  risks of these  mortgage  backed
securities.                                                               

Mortgage Backed Securities                                                
   Mortgage backed  securities  represent  interests in pools of mortgages.  The
   mortgages  that  comprise  a  pool  normally  have  similar  interest  rates,
   maturities and other terms.  Mortgages may have fixed or adjustable  interest
rates.  Interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as ARMs.

   Mortgage backed  securities  come in a variety of forms.  Many have extremely
   complicated  terms.  The  simplest  form of mortgage  backed  securities  are
   pass-through  certificates.  An issuer of pass-through  certificates  gathers
   monthly  payments from an  underlying  pool of  mortgages.  Then,  the issuer
   deducts its fees and  expenses  and passes the balance of the  payments  onto
   the certificate  holders once a month.  Holders of pass-through  certificates
   receive  a  pro  rata  share  of  all  payments  and  pre-payments  from  the
   underlying  mortgages.  As a result,  the holders  assume all the  prepayment
risks of the underlying mortgages.                                        

   The Portfolio may invest in both agency  mortgage  backed  securities  and in
   mortgage backed  securities  that are issued by a private entity.  Securities
   issued by  private  entities  must be rated  investment  grade by one or more
   nationally  recognized  rating services.  The ability to invest in securities
issued by a private entity creates credit risk.                           

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations                                 
      CMOs,  including  interests in real estate  mortgage  investment  conduits
      (REMICs),   allocate   payments  and   prepayments   from  an   underlying
      pass-through  certificate  among holders of different  classes of mortgage
      backed  securities.  This creates  different  prepayment and interest rate
      for each CMO  class.  The  degree of  increased  or  decreased  prepayment
      risks  depends  upon  the  structure  of the  CMOs.  However,  the  actual
      returns  on  any  type  of  mortgage   backed  security  depend  upon  the
      performance of the underlying pool of mortgages,  which no one can predict
and will not vary among pools.                                      

Sequential CMOs                                                     
      In a  sequential  pay  CMO,  one  class  of CMOs  receives  all  principal
      payments and  prepayments.  The next class of CMOs  receives all principal
      payments  after the first  class is paid off.  This  process  repeats  for
      each  sequential  class of CMO. As a result,  each class of sequential pay
CMOs reduces the prepayment risks of subsequent classes.            

PACs, TACs and Companion Classes                                    
      More  sophisticated CMOs include planned  amortization  classes (PACs) and
      targeted  amortization  classes  (TACs).  PACs and TACs  are  issued  with
      companion   classes.   PACs  and  TACs  receive  principal   payments  and
      prepayments at a specified rate. The companion  classes receive  principal
      payments and  prepayments  in excess of the  specified  rate. In addition,
      PACs will receive the companion classes' share of principal  payments,  if
      necessary,  to cover a shortfall in the prepayment  rate.  This helps PACs
      and TACs to  control  prepayment  risks by  increasing  the risks to their
companion classes.                                                  

IOs and POs                                                         
      CMOs may allocate  interest  payments to one class  (Interest Only or IOs)
      and  principal  payments to another  class  (Principal  Only or POs).  POs
      increase  in value  when  prepayment  rates  increase.  In  contrast,  IOs
      decrease  in value  when  prepayments  increase,  because  the  underlying
      mortgages generate less interest payments.  However,  IOs tend to increase
      in value when interest rates rise (and prepayments  decrease),  making IOs
a useful hedge against market risks.                                

Floaters and Inverse Floaters                                       
      Another variant  allocates  interest payments between two classes of CMOs.
      One class  (Floaters)  receives a share of interest  payments based upon a
      market index such as LIBOR.  The other class (Inverse  Floaters)  receives
      any remaining  interest  payments from the underlying  mortgages.  Floater
      classes  receive  more  interest  (and  Inverse  Floater  classes  receive
      correspondingly  less  interest)  as  interest  rates  rise.  This  shifts
      prepayment  and  interest  rate  risks  from the  Floater  to the  Inverse
      Floater  class,  reducing the price  volatility  of the Floater  class and
increasing the price volatility of the Inverse Floater class.       

Z Classes                                                           
      CMOs must allocate all payments received from the underlying  mortgages to
      some class.  To capture any unallocated  payments,  CMOs generally have an
      accrual  (Z)  class.  Z  classes  do not  receive  any  payments  from the
      underlying  mortgages  until  all other  CMO  classes  have been paid off.
      Once this  happens,  holders  of Z class CMOs  receive  all  payments  and
      prepayments.  Similarly,  REMICs have residual  interests that receive any
mortgage payments not allocated to another REMIC class.             

Special Transactions                                                      

Repurchase Agreements                                                     
   Repurchase  agreements  are  transactions  in  which  the  Portfolio  buys  a
   security  from a dealer  or bank and  agrees to sell the  security  back at a
   mutually  agreed upon time and price.  The repurchase  price exceeds the sale
   price,  reflecting the Portfolio's return on the transaction.  This return is
   unrelated to the interest  rate on the  underlying  security.  The  Portfolio
   will enter into repurchase  agreements  only with banks and other  recognized
   financial  institutions,  such as securities dealers,  deemed creditworthy by
the Adviser.                                                              

The Portfolio's custodian or subcustodian will take possession of the     
securities subject to repurchase agreements.  The Adviser or subcustodian 
will monitor the value of the underlying security each day to ensure that 
the value of the security always equals or exceeds the repurchase price.  

Repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks.                        

Delayed Delivery Transactions                                             
   Delayed  delivery  transactions,  including  when  issued  transactions,  are
   arrangements  in which the Portfolio buys  securities  for a set price,  with
   payment and delivery of the  securities  scheduled for a future time.  During
   the  period  between  purchase  and  settlement,  no  payment  is made by the
   Portfolio  to the  issuer  and no  interest  accrues  to the  Portfolio.  The
   Portfolio  records the  transaction  when it agrees to buy the securities and
   reflects  their  value in  determining  the price of its  shares.  Settlement
   dates may be a month or more after entering into these  transactions  so that
   the  market  values  of the  securities  bought  may vary  from the  purchase
   prices.  Therefore,  delayed  delivery  transactions  create market risks for
   the Portfolio.  Delayed  delivery  transactions  also involve credit risks in
the event of a counterparty default.                                      

To Be Announced Securities (TBAs)                                   
      As with other delayed  delivery  transactions,  a seller agrees to issue a
      TBA  security at a future date.  However,  the seller does not specify the
      particular  securities to be delivered.  Instead,  the Portfolio agrees to
      accept any security  that meets  specified  terms.  For example,  in a TBA
      mortgage  backed  transaction,  the  Portfolio  and the seller would agree
      upon the  issuer,  interest  rate and terms of the  underlying  mortgages.
      The seller would not identify the specific  underlying  mortgages until it
      issues the security.  TBA mortgage  backed  securities  increase  interest
      rate risks because the  underlying  mortgages may be less  favorable  than
anticipated by the Portfolio.                                       

Dollar Rolls                                                        
      Dollar rolls are  transactions  where the Portfolio sells  mortgage-backed
      securities   with  a  commitment  to  buy  similar,   but  not  identical,
      mortgage-backed  securities  on a future date at a lower price.  Normally,
      one or both  securities  involved  are  TBA  mortgage  backed  securities.
Dollar rolls are subject to market risks and credit risks.          

Securities Lending                                                        
   The Portfolio  may lend  portfolio  securities to borrowers  that the Adviser
   deems  creditworthy.  In  return,  the  Portfolio  receives  cash  or  liquid
   securities  from the  borrower  as  collateral.  The  borrower  must  furnish
   additional   collateral  if  the  market  value  of  the  loaned   securities
   increases.  Also,  the borrower must pay the Portfolio the  equivalent of any
dividends or interest received on the loaned securities.                  

   The Portfolio will reinvest cash  collateral in securities that qualify as an
   acceptable  investment  for the  Portfolio.  However,  the Portfolio must pay
interest to the borrower for the use of cash collateral.                  

   Loans are  subject  to  termination  at the  option of the  Portfolio  or the
   borrower.  The Portfolio will not have the right to vote on securities  while
   they  are on  loan,  but it  will  terminate  a loan in  anticipation  of any
   important  vote. The Portfolio may pay  administrative  and custodial fees in
   connection  with a loan  and may pay a  negotiated  portion  of the  interest
earned on the cash collateral to a securities lending agent or broker.    

   Securities  lending  activities are subject to interest rate risks and credit
risks.                                                                    

Asset Coverage                                                            
   In order to secure its obligations in connection with  derivatives  contracts
   or  special  transactions,  the  Portfolio  will  either  own the  underlying
   assets, enter into an offsetting  transaction or set aside readily marketable
   securities with a value that equals or exceeds the  Portfolio's  obligations.
   Unless the  Portfolio has other readily  marketable  assets to set aside,  it
   cannot  trade  assets  used  to  secure  such  obligations  entering  into an
   offsetting  derivative  contract or terminating a special  transaction.  This
   may  cause  the  Portfolio  to miss  favorable  trading  opportunities  or to
realize losses on derivative contracts or special transactions.           

Portfolio Turnover                                                              
Prepayment of mortgage backed  securities owned by the Portfolio could result in
a high portfolio  turnover rate, which is likely to generate  shorter-term gains
(losses) for its shareholders.  Short-term gains are taxed at a higher rate than
longer-term  gains. High portfolio  turnover  increases the Portfolio's  trading
costs and may have an adverse impact on the Portfolio's performance.            

Temporary Defensive Investments                                                 
The Portfolio may temporarily  depart from its principal  investment  strategies
by investing its assets in cash, cash items,  and  shorter-term,  higher quality
debt securities and similar  obligations.  It may do this to minimize  potential
losses and maintain  liquidity to meet  shareholder  redemptions  during adverse
market  conditions.  This may cause the Portfolio to give up greater  investment
returns to  maintain  the safety of  principal,  that is,  the  original  amount
invested by shareholders.                                                       

Investment Risks                                                                

Interest Rate Risks                                                             
o     Prices of fixed  income  securities  rise and fall in response to interest
   rate changes for similar  securities.  Generally,  when interest  rates rise,
prices of fixed income securities fall.                                   

o     Interest  rate changes have a greater  effect on the price of fixed income
   securities with longer durations.  Duration measures the price sensitivity of
a fixed income security to changes in interest rates.                     

Credit Risks                                                                    
o     Credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security  
  by failing to pay interest or principal when due. If an issuer defaults, the
Portfolio will lose money.                                                

Prepayment Risks                                                                
o     Generally,  homeowners  have the option to prepay  their  mortgages at any
   time without  penalty.  Homeowners  frequently  refinance  high interest rate
   mortgages  when  mortgage  rates  fall.  This  results in the  prepayment  of
   mortgage  backed   securities   with  higher   interest  rates.   Conversely,
   prepayments due to refinancings  decrease when mortgage rates increase.  This
   extends the life of mortgage backed  securities with lower interest rates. As
   a result,  increases in  prepayments  of high interest  rate mortgage  backed
   securities,  or decreases in  prepayments  of lower  interest  rate  mortgage
   backed  securities,  may  reduce  their  yield and price.  This  relationship
   between interest rates and mortgage  prepayments  makes the price of mortgage
   backed  securities  more  volatile  than  most  other  types of fixed  income
securities with comparable credit risks.                                  

o     Mortgage backed  securities  generally  compensate for greater  prepayment
   risk by  paying  a  higher  yield.  The  difference  between  the  yield of a
   mortgage  backed  security and the yield of a U.S.  Treasury  security with a
   comparable  maturity (the spread)  measures the additional  interest paid for
   risk.  Spreads may  increase  generally  in  response to adverse  economic or
   market  conditions.  A security's spread may also increase if the security is
   perceived  to  have  increased  prepayment  risk or less  market  demand.  An
increase in the spread may cause the price of the security to decline.    
o     If a fixed income security is called, the Portfolio may have to reinvest  
the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates,  
higher credit risks, or other less favorable characteristics.             

Liquidity Risks                                                                 
o     Trading opportunities are more limited for CMOs that have complicated     
  terms or that are not widely held. These features may make it more difficult
to sell or buy a security at a favorable price or time. Consequently, the 
Portfolio may have to accept a lower price to sell a security, sell other 
 securities to raise cash or give up an investment opportunity, any of which
could have a negative effect on the Portfolio's performance. Infrequent   
trading of securities may also lead to an increase in their  price        
volatility.                                                               

o     Liquidity risk also refers to the possibility that the Portfolio may not  
 be able to sell a security when it wants to. If this happens, the Portfolio
will be required to continue to hold the security, and the Portfolio could
incur losses.                                                             

Risks Associated with Complicated CMOs                                          
o     CMOs with complicated terms, such as companion classes, IOs, POs and      
 Inverse Floaters, generally entail greater market, prepayment and liquidity
risks than other mortgage backed securities. For example, their prices are
more volatile and their trading market may be more limited.               

Investment Ratings for Investment Grade Securities                              
The Adviser will determinate whether a security is investment grade based upon  
the credit ratings given by one or more nationally recognized rating services.  
For example, Standard and Poor's, a rating service, assigns ratings to          
investment grade securities (AAA, AA, A, and BBB) based on their assessment of  
the likelihood of the issuer's inability to pay interest or principal (default) 
when due on each security. Lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit     
risk.  If a security has not received a rating, the Portfolio must rely         
entirely upon the Adviser's credit assessment that the security is comparable   
to investment grade.                                                            

Management Organization and Capital Structure                                   

Investment Adviser

Portfolio Managers                                                              
The  Portfolio's  managers  are:  Kathleen  Foody-Malus,  Edward Tiedge and Todd

Shareholder Information                                                         

Beneficial  interests in the Portfolio  are issued  solely in private  placement
transactions  which do not involve any "public  offering"  within the meaning of
Section  4(2) of the  Securities  Act of 1933  (1933  Act).  Investments  in the
Portfolio may only be made by investment  companies,  insurance company separate
accounts,  common or commingled trust funds or similar organizations or entities
that are "accredited  investors"  within the meaning of Regulation D of the 1933
Act. This  Registration  Statement  does not constitute an offer to sell, or the
solicitation  of an offer to buy, any "security"  within the meaning of the 1933
Act.                                                                            

Pricing of Portfolio Shares                                                     
The net  asset  value  (NAV) of the  Portfolio  is  determined  as of the end of
regular trading (normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) each day the NYSE is open.  

The NAV per share of the  Portfolio  is computed  by  dividing  the value of the
Portfolio's  assets,  less  all  liabilities,  by the  total  number  of  shares
outstanding.                                                                    

Purchase of Portfolio Shares                                                    
Shares of the  Portfolio  may be purchased  any day the New York Stock  Exchange
(NYSE) is open.                                                                 

Purchases  should  be made in  accordance  with  procedures  established  by the
Transfer Agent.                                                                 

Purchase  orders  for  Shares  of  the  Portfolio  will  receive  the  NAV  next
determined  after  the  purchase  order  is  received  in  proper  form  by  the
Portfolio's Transfer Agent, Federated Shareholder Services Company.             

Payment by federal  funds  must be  received  by the  Trust's  custodian,  State
Street Bank and Trust  Company,  by 3:00 p.m.  (Eastern  time) the next business
day following the receipt of the purchase order.                                

There is no minimum required initial or subsequent investment amount.           

The  Portfolio  reserves  the  right  to  cease  accepting  investments  in  the
Portfolio at any time or to reject any investment order.                        

Redemption of Portfolio Shares                                                  
Shares of the Portfolio may be redeemed any day the NYSE is open.               

Redemption requests should be made in accordance with procedures  established by
the Transfer Agent.                                                             

Redemption  requests will receive the NAV next  determined  after the request is
received in proper form by the Transfer Agent.                                  

Redemption  proceeds will normally be delivered  within one business day after a
request is received in proper form. Payment may be delayed up to seven days:    

o     to allow a purchase order to clear;                                       
o     during periods of market volatility; or                                   
o     when a  shareholder's  trade  activity  or amount  adversely  impacts  the
Portfolio's ability to manage its assets.                                 

Redemption in Kind                                                              
Although the Portfolio intends to pay Share redemptions in cash, it reserves    
the right to pay the redemption price in whole or in part by a distribution of  
the Portfolio's portfolio securities.                                           

Confirmations and Account Statements                                            
Shareholders  will  receive  confirmation  of  purchases  and  redemptions.   In
addition,  shareholders will receive periodic  statements  reporting all account
activity including dividends paid. The Trust will not issue share certificates. 

Dividends and Distributions                                                     
The Portfolio  declares  dividends daily and pays them monthly to  shareholders.
Purchases made by wire begin earning  dividends on the day the wire is received.
Purchases  made by check begin  earning  dividends on the business day after the
Portfolio  receives the check. In either case,  dividends are earned through the
day a redemption request is received.                                           

Dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested  in  additional  Shares unless the
shareholder has elected cash payments.                                          

Tax Consequences                                                                
Portfolio  distributions are taxable to the shareholder  whether paid in cash or
reinvested in the Portfolio.  Dividends are taxable as ordinary income;  capital
gains are  taxable  at  different  rates  depending  upon the length of time the
Portfolio holds its assets.                                                     

Portfolio  distributions  are expected to be both  dividends and capital  gains.
Redemptions are taxable sales.

     Indemnification  is  provided to Officers  and  Trustees of the  Registrant
     pursuant to Section 2 of Article XII of Registrant's  Declaration of Trust.
     The  Investment  Advisory  Contract  between the  Registrant  and Federated

     willful misfeasance,  bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of
     the  obligations  or duties under the Investment  Advisory  Contract on the
     part of Adviser,  Adviser  shall not be liable to the  Registrant or to any
     shareholder  for any act or omission in the course of or  connected  in any
     way with rendering  services or for any losses that may be sustained in the
     purchase,  holding,  or sale of any  security.  Registrant's  Trustees  and
  Officers are covered by an Investment Trust Errors and Omissions Policy.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
     of 1933 may be permitted to Trustees,  Officers, and controlling persons of
     the  Registrant by the Registrant  pursuant to the  Declaration of Trust or
     otherwise,  the  Registrant is aware that in the opinion of the  Securities
     and Exchange  Commission,  such indemnification is against public policy as
     expressed in the Act and, therefore, is unenforceable.  In the event that a
     claim for indemnification  against such liabilities (other than the payment
     by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by Trustees),  Officers,  or
     controlling  persons of the  Registrant in connection  with the  successful
     defense of any act,  suit,  or  proceeding)  is asserted by such  Trustees,
     Officers,  or  controlling  persons in  connection  with the  shares  being
     registered,  the Registrant will,  unless in the opinion of its counsel the
     matter has been  settled  by  controlling  precedent,  submit to a court of
     appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
     against  public  policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
final adjudication of such issues.                                    

     Insofar as  indemnification  for liabilities  may be permitted  pursuant to
     Section 17 of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 for Trustees,  Officers,
     and controlling persons of the Registrant by the Registrant pursuant to the
     Declaration of Trust or otherwise,  the Registrant is aware of the position
     of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  as set  forth in  Investment
     Company Act Release No. IC-11330. Therefore, the Registrant undertakes that
     in addition to complying with the applicable  provisions of the Declaration
     of Trust or otherwise,  in the absence of a final decision on the merits by
     a court or other body before  which the  proceeding  was  brought,  that an
     indemnification  payment  will not be made  unless in the absence of such a
     decision,  a reasonable  determination  based upon factual  review has been
     made (i) by a majority  vote of a quorum of non-party  Trustees who are not
     interested  persons of the Registrant or (ii) by independent  legal counsel
     in a written  opinion  that the  indemnitee  was not  liable  for an act of
     willful misfeasance,  bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of
     duties.  The Registrant  further  undertakes  that  advancement of expenses
     incurred in the defense of a proceeding  (upon  undertaking  for  repayment
     unless it is ultimately  determined  that  indemnification  is appropriate)
     against an Officer,  Trustee,  or controlling person of the Registrant will
     not be  made  absent  the  fulfillment  of at  least  one of the  following
     conditions: (i) the indemnitee provides security for his undertaking;  (ii)
     the  Registrant is insured  against  losses arising by reason of any lawful
     advances;  or (iii) a  majority  of a  quorum  of  disinterested  non-party
     Trustees or independent  legal counsel in a written opinion makes a factual
     determination  that  there is  reason to  believe  the  indemnitee  will be
entitled to indemnification.

INFORMATION REQUIRED IN A PROSPECTUS

Items 1, 2, 3 and 5A of Part A are omitted pursuant to Item F.3. of the General 
Instructions to Form N-1A.                                                      

ITEM 4.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT. 

Federated Core Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, (the "Trust") is a        
diversified, open-end management investment company registered under the        
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Trust was organized on     
August 21, 1996. The Declaration of Trust permits the Trust to offer separate   
series of shares of beneficial interest representing interests in separate      
portfolios of securities ("Series"). As of the date of this registration        
statement, the Board of Trustees ("Trustees") has established one diversified   
Series of the Trust known as High-Yield Bond Portfolio (the "Portfolio").       

Beneficial interests in the Portfolio are issued solely in private placement    
transactions which do not involve any "public offering" within the meaning of   
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"). Investments in the 
Portfolio may only be made by investment companies, insurance company separate  
accounts, common or commingled trust funds or similar organizations or entities 
that are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D under the    
1933 Act. This Registration Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or  
the solicitation of an offer to buy, any "security" within the meaning of the   
1933 Act.                                                                       

The Portfolio has been created and is managed to provide a convenient vehicle   
for certain publicly offered funds, for which a subsidiary of Federated         
Investors serves as investment adviser, and other accredited investors to       
participate conveniently and economically in the high-yield bond sector of the  
fixed-income securities market.                                                 

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES                                              

Investment Objective                                                            

The investment objective of the Portfolio is to seek high current income. The   
investment objective cannot be changed without approval of shareholders. While  
there is no assurance that the Portfolio will achieve its investment objective, 
it endeavors to do so by following the investment policies described in this    
prospectus.                                                                     

P-->POS AMI2nd�"Page"�of�10TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�2nd
Investment Policies                                                             

Unless stated otherwise, the Trustees can change the investment policies without
the approval of shareholders. Shareholders will be notified before any material 
change becomes effective. The Portfolio endeavors to achieve its objective by   
investing primarily in a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of fixed 
income securities. The fixed income securities in which the Portfolio intends to
invest are lower-rated corporate debt obligations, which are commonly referred  
to as "junk bonds." Some of these fixed income securities may involve equity    
features. Capital growth will be considered, but only when consistent with the  
investment objective of high current income.                                    

ACCEPTABLE INVESTMENTS. The Portfolio invests at least 65% of its assets in     
lower-rated fixed income securities. Under normal circumstances, the Portfolio  
will not invest more than 10% of the value of its total assets in common equity 
securities and their equivalents. The fixed income securities in which the      
Portfolio invests include, but are not limited to:                              
o preferred stocks;                                                     
o bonds;                                                                
o debentures;                                                           
o notes;                                                                
o equipment lease certificates; and                                     

o equipment trust certificates.                                         

The securities in which the Portfolio may invest are generally rated BBB or     
lower by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P") or Fitch Investors Service     
("Fitch") or Baa or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), or are
not rated but are determined by the Portfolio's investment adviser to be of     
comparable quality, and may include bonds in default. Securities which are rated
BBB or lower by S&P or Fitch or Baa or lower by Moody's have speculative        
characteristics. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more 
likely to lead to weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments than
highly rated bonds. A description of the rating categories is contained in the  
Appendix to this prospectus. There is no lower limit with respect to rating     
categories for securities in which the Portfolio may invest. See "Investment
Risks" below.                                                                   

FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Portfolio may invest in foreign securities, including   
foreign securities not publicly traded in the United States, which may include  
any of the types of securities described above (see "Acceptable Investments").  
Investments in foreign securities, particularly those of non-governmental       
issuers, involve considerations which are not ordinarily associated with        
investments in domestic issuers. These considerations include the possibility of
expropriation, the unavailability of financial information or the difficulty of 
interpreting financial information prepared under foreign accounting standards, 
less liquidity and more volatility in foreign securities markets, the impact of 
political, social, or diplomatic developments, and the difficulty of assessing  
economic trends in foreign countries. It may also be more difficult to enforce  
contractual obligations abroad than would be the case in the United States      
because of differences in the legal systems. Transaction costs in foreign       
securities may be higher. The adviser will consider these and other factors     
before investing in foreign securities and will not make such investments       
unless, in its opinion, such investments will meet the Portfolio's standards and
objectives.                                                                     

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. The Portfolio may invest in convertible securities.     
Convertible securities include a spectrum of securities which can be exchanged  
for or converted into common stock. Convertible securities may include, but are 
not limited to: convertible bonds or debentures; convertible preferred stock;   
units consisting of usable bonds and warrants; or securities which cap or       
otherwise limit returns to the convertible security holder, such as DECS        
(Dividend Enhanced Convertible Stock, or Debt Exchangeable for Common Stock when
issued as a debt security), LYONS (Liquid Yield Option Notes, which are         
corporate bonds that are purchased at prices below par with no coupons and are  
convertible into stock), PERCS (Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock, an
equity issue that pays a high cash dividend, has a cap price and mandatory      
conversion to common stock at maturity), and PRIDES (Preferred Redeemable       
Increased Dividend Securities, which are essentially the same as DECS; the      
difference is little more than who initially underwrites the issue).            

Convertible securities are often rated below investment grade or not rated      
because they fall below debt obligations and just above common equity in order  
of preference or priority on the issuer's balance sheet. Convertible securities 
rated below investment grade may be subject to some of the same risks as        
lower-rated bonds.                                                              

 TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. The Portfolio may invest temporarily in cash and
short-term obligations for defensive purposes during times of unusual           
market conditions. Short-term obligations may include:                          

o certificates of deposit;                                              

  o commercial paper rated A-1 or A-2 by S&P, Prime-1 or Prime-2 by Moody's,
or F-1 or F-2 by Fitch and variable rate demand master notes;                   

o short-term notes;                                                     

   o obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; and         

o repurchase agreements.                                                

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Portfolio will engage in repurchase agreements.      
Repurchase agreements are arrangements in which banks, broker/dealers, and other
recognized financial institutions sell U.S. government securities or other      
securities to the Portfolio and agree at the time of sale to repurchase them at 
a mutually agreed upon time and price. The Portfolio or its custodian will take 
possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements and these         
securities will be marked to market daily. To the extent that the original      
seller does not repurchase the securities from the Portfolio, the Portfolio     
could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities.    

In the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became       
insolvent, disposition of such securities by the Portfolio might be delayed     
pending court action. The Portfolio believes that, under the regular procedures 
normally in effect for custody of the Portfolio's portfolio securities subject  
to repurchase agreements, a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor 
of the Portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities. The     
Portfolio will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other       
recognized financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are found by   
the Portfolio's adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by
the Trustees.                                                                   

RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES. The Portfolio may invest in restricted      
securities. Restricted securities are any securities in which the Portfolio may 
otherwise invest pursuant to its investment objective and policies, but which   
are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities law. Under       
criteria established by the Trustees, certain restricted securities are         
determined to be liquid. To the extent that restricted securities are not       
determined to be liquid, the Portfolio will limit their purchase together with  
other illiquid securities including non-negotiable time deposits, and repurchase
agreements providing for settlement in more than seven days after notice, to 15%
of its net assets.                                                              

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. In order to generate additional income, the    
Portfolio may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, or  
both, up to one-third of the value of its total assets, to broker/dealers,      
banks, or other institutional borrowers of securities. This is a fundamental    
policy which may not be changed without shareholder approval. The Portfolio will
only enter into loan arrangements with broker/dealers, banks, or other          
institutions which the investment adviser has determined are creditworthy under 
guidelines established by the Trustees and will receive collateral in the form  
of cash or U.S. government securities equal to at least 100% of the value of the
securities loaned at all times.                                                 

WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS. The Portfolio may purchase       
securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These transactions are   
arrangements in which the Portfolio purchases securities with payment and       
delivery scheduled for a future time. The seller's failure to complete these    
transactions may cause the Portfolio to miss a price or yield considered to be  
advantageous. Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these 
transactions, and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from   
the purchase prices.                                                            

The Portfolio may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the adviser    
deems it appropriate to do so. In addition, the Portfolio may enter into        
transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market
values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar         
securities at later dates. The Portfolio may realize short-term profits or      
losses upon the sale of such commitments.                                       

INVESTMENT RISKS 

The prices of fixed income securities fluctuate inversely to the direction of   
interest rates.                                                                 

The corporate debt obligations in which the Portfolio invests are usually not in
the three highest rating categories of the nationally recognized statistical    
rating organizations (AAA, AA, or A for S&P or Fitch, and Aaa, Aa or A for      
Moody's), but are in the lower rating categories or are unrated but are of      
comparable quality and are regarded as having predominately speculative         
characteristics. Lower-rated or unrated bonds are commonly referred to as "junk 
bonds." There is no minimal acceptable rating for a security to be purchased or 
held in the Portfolio's portfolio, and the Portfolio may, from to time, purchase
or hold securities rated in the lowest rating category and may include bonds in 
default. A description of the rating categories is contained in the Appendix.   

Lower-rated securities will usually offer higher yields than higher-rated       
securities. However, there is more risk associated with these investments. This 
is because of reduced creditworthiness and increased risk of default.           
Lower-rated securities generally tend to reflect short-term corporate and market
developments to a greater extent than higher-rated securities which react       
primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates. Short-term    
corporate and market developments affecting the prices or liquidity of          
lower-rated securities could include adverse news affecting major issuers,      
underwriters, or dealers in lower-rated securities. In addition, since there are
fewer investors in lower-rated securities, it may be harder to sell the         
securities at an optimum time. As a result of these factors, lower-rated        
securities tend to have more price volatility and carry more risk to principal  
and income than higher-rated securities.                                        

An economic downturn may adversely affect the value of some lower-rated bonds.  
Such a downturn may especially affect highly leveraged companies or companies in
cyclically sensitive industries, where deterioration in a company's cash flow   
may impair its ability to meet its obligation to pay principal and interest to  
bondholders in a timely fashion. From time to time, as a result of changing     
conditions, issuers of lower-rated bonds may seek or may be required to         
restructure the terms and conditions of the securities they have issued. As a   
result of these restructurings, holders of lower-rated securities may receive   
less principal and interest than they had bargained for at the time such bonds  
were purchased.                                                                 

In the event of a restructuring, the Portfolio may bear additional legal or     
administrative expenses in order to maximize recovery from an issuer.           

The Portfolio may, from time to time, own zero coupon bonds or pay-in-kind      
securities. A zero coupon bond makes no periodic interest payments and the      
entire obligation becomes due only upon maturity. Pay-in-kind securities make   
periodic payments in the form of additional securities (as opposed to cash). The
price of zero coupon bonds and pay-in-kind securities are generally more        
sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than are conventional bonds.        
Additionally, federal tax law requires that interest on zero coupon bonds and   
pay-in-kind securities be reported as income to the Portfolio even though the   
Portfolio received no cash interest until the maturity or payment date of such  
securities.                                                                     

Many corporate debt obligations, including many lower-rated bonds, permit the   
issuers to call the security and thereby redeem their obligations earlier than  
the stated maturity dates. Issuers are more likely to call bonds during periods 
of declining interest rates. In these cases, if the Portfolio owns a bond which 
is called, the Portfolio will receive its return of principal earlier than      
expected and would likely be required to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest
rates, thus reducing income to the Portfolio.                                   

REDUCING RISKS OF LOWER-RATED SECURITIES. The Portfolio's investment adviser    
believes that the risks of investing in lower-rated securities can be reduced.  
The professional portfolio management techniques used by the Portfolio to       
attempt to reduce these risks include:                                          

CREDIT RESEARCH. The Portfolio's investment adviser will perform its own credit 
analysis in addition to using recognized rating agencies and other sources,     
including discussions with the issuer's management, the judgment of other       
investment analysts, and its own informed judgment. The adviser's credit        
analysis will consider the issuer's financial soundness, its responsiveness to  
changes in interest rates and business conditions, and its anticipated cash     
flow, interest, or dividend coverage and earnings. In evaluating an issuer, the 
adviser places special emphasis on the estimated current value of the issuer's  
assets rather than historical cost.                                             

DIVERSIFICATION. The Portfolio invests in securities of many different
issuers, industries, and economic sectors to reduce portfolio risk.             

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. The Portfolio's adviser will analyze current developments and
trends in the economy and in the financial markets. When investing in           
lower-rated securities, timing and selection are critical, and analysis of the  
business cycle can be important.                                                

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS                                                          

The Portfolio will not borrow money directly or through reverse repurchase      
agreements (arrangements in which the Portfolio sells a portfolio instrument for
a percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a set date), 
or pledge securities except, under certain circumstances, the Portfolio may     
borrow money and engage in reverse repurchase agreements in amounts up to       
one-third of the value of its total assets and pledge up to 15% of the value of 
those assets to secure such borrowings.

ITEM 5.  MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST 

(a) BOARD OF TRUSTEES. The Trust is managed by a Board of Trustees. The Trustees
are responsible for managing the business affairs of the Trust and for          
exercising all of the Trust's powers except those reserved for the shareholders.
An Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees handles the Board's             
responsibilities between meetings of the Board.                                 

(b) ADVISER. Pursuant to an investment advisory contract with the Trust,        
investment decisions for the Portfolio are made by Federated Research Corp., the
Portfolio's investment adviser, subject to direction by the Trustees. The       
adviser continually conducts investment research and supervision for the        
Portfolio and is responsible for the purchase or sale of portfolio instruments. 
Federated Research Corp. is located at Federated Investors Tower, Pittsburgh, PA
15222-3779.                                                                     

   ADVISORY FEES. - The Adviser will provide investment advisory services at
no fee.                                                                         

ADVISER'S BACKGROUND. Federated Research Corp., a Delaware business trust,      
organized on June 14, 1990, is a registered investment adviser under the        
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It is a subsidiary of Federated Investors. All 
of the Class A (voting) shares of Federated Investors are owned by a trust, the 
trustees of which are John F. Donahue, Chairman and Trustee of Federated        
Investors, Mr. Donahue's wife, and Mr. Donahue's son, J. Christopher Donahue,   
who is President and Trustee of Federated Investors.                            

Federated Research Corp. and other subsidiaries of Federated Investors serve as 
investment advisers to a number of investment companies and private accounts.   
Certain other subsidiaries also provide administrative services to a number of  
investment companies. With over $110 billion invested across over 300 funds     
under management and/or administration by its subsidiaries, as of December 31,
1996, Federated Investors is one of the largest mutual fund investment managers 
in the United States. With more than 2,000 employees, Federated continues to be 
led by the management who founded the company in 1955. Federated funds are      
presently at work in and through 4,500 financial institutions nationwide.       

Both the Portfolio and the adviser have adopted strict codes of ethics governing
the conduct of all employees who manage the Portfolio and its portfolio         
securities. These codes recognize that such persons owe a fiduciary duty to the 
Portfolio's shareholders and must place the interests of shareholders ahead of  
the employees' own interest. Among other things, the codes: require preclearance
and periodic reporting of personal securities transactions; prohibit personal   
transactions in securities being purchased or sold, or being considered for     
purchase or sale, by the Portfolio; prohibit purchasing securities in initial   
public offerings; and prohibit taking profits on securities held for less than  
sixty days.                                                                     
Violations of the codes are subject to review by the Trustees, and could result 
in severe penalties.                                                            

(c) Mark E. Durbiano has been the Portfolio's portfolio manager since inception.
Mr. Durbiano joined Federated Investors in 1982 and has been a Senior Vice      
President of the Portfolio's investment adviser since January 1996. From 1988   
through 1995, Mr. Durbiano was a Vice President of the Portfolio's investment   
adviser. Mr. Durbiano is a Chartered Financial Analyst and received his M.B.A.  
in Finance from the University of Pittsburgh.

Company provides these at an annual rate of 0.05% of the average aggregate daily
net assets.                                                                     

(e) Federated Services Company, through its registered transfer agent Federated 
Shareholder Services Company, maintains all necessary shareholder records. For  
its services, the transfer agent receives a fee based on the size, type and     
number of accounts and transactions made by shareholders.

(c)  Not applicable                                                             

(d)  Not applicable

Trust will distribute all of its net income and capital gains to its            
shareholders and such distributions will be taxable as such to its shareholders;
while shareholders may be proportionately liable for taxes on income and gains  
of the Trust, shareholders not subject to tax on their income will not be       
required to pay tax on amounts distributed to them; the Trust will inform its   
shareholders of the amount and nature of such income and gains distributed.     

(h) Not applicable.                                                             

ITEM 7.  PURCHASE OF SECURITIES BEING OFFERED 

(a) Beneficial interests in the Portfolio are issued solely in private placement
transactions which do not involve any "public offering" within the meaning of   
Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. See Item 4 above.                                 

     Federated Securities Corp., Federated Investors Tower, 1001 Liberty Avenue,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3779 serves as the Trust's Placement Agent. It is
a Pennsylvania corporation organized on November 14, 1969, and is the principal 
distributor for a number of investment companies. Federated Securities Corp.    
receives no fee for its services as Placement Agent for the Trust. Federated    
Securities Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Federated Investors.           

(b - c) The net asset value ("NAV") of shares of the Portfolio is determined as 
of the close of trading (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE"), Monday through Friday, except on: (i) days on which there are
not sufficient changes in the value of a Portfolio's portfolio securities that  
its NAV might be materially affected; (ii) days on which no shares are tendered 
for redemption and no orders to purchase shares are received; or (iii) the      
following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, Presidents' Day,    
Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and    
Christmas Day. Any day on which the Portfolio may determine its net asset value,
as described above, may hereinafter be referred to as a "Valuation Day."        

The Portfolio accepts purchase orders for shares of the Portfolio at the NAV per
share of the Portfolio next determined on each Valuation Day. There is no sales 
charge on the purchase of shares.                                               

Purchase orders for shares of the Portfolio will receive, on any Valuation Day, 
the net asset value next determined following receipt by Federated Shareholder  
Services Company, the Trust's transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") of such     
order. If the purchase order is received by the Transfer Agent prior to 4:00    
p.m. Eastern time and payment in the form of federal funds is received on that  
day by State Street Bank and Trust Company, as the Trust's custodian (the       
"Custodian"), the shareholder will receive the dividend declared on that day. If
the purchase order is received by the Transfer Agent after 4:00 p.m. (Eastern   
time), the shareholder will receive the dividend declared on the following day  
even if the Custodian receives federal funds on that day.                       

Certificates for shares will not be issued. Each shareholder's account will be  
maintained by the Transfer Agent.                                               

The NAV per share of the Portfolio is computed by dividing the value of the     
Portfolio's assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of shares         
outstanding.                                                                    

The Trust reserves the right to cease accepting investments in the Portfolio at 
any time or to reject any investment order.                                     

(d)  There is no minimum required initial or subsequent investment amount.      
(e)  Not applicable.                                                            
(f)  Not applicable.                                                            
(g)  Not applicable.                                                            

ITEM 8.  REDEMPTION OR REPURCHASE 

(a) Shareholders may redeem shares at the net asset value per share next        
determined on each Valuation Day. Redemption requests should be transmitted by  
customers in accordance with procedures established by the Transfer Agent.      
Redemption requests for shares of the Portfolio transmitted to the Transfer     
Agent prior to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on each Valuation Day will be redeemed at 
the net asset value per share next determined and the redemption proceeds       
normally will be delivered to the shareholder's account on that day; no dividend
will be paid on the day of redemption. Redemption requests received by the      
Transfer Agent after 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on each Valuation Day will be     
redeemed at the net asset value per share next determined and redemption        
proceeds normally will be delivered to the shareholder's account the following  
day; shares redeemed in this manner will receive the dividend declared on the   
day of the redemption. Payments for redemptions will in any event be made within
seven calendar days following receipt of the request.                           

The right of any investor to receive payment with respect to any withdrawal may 
be suspended or the payment of the withdrawal proceeds postponed during any     
period in which the NYSE is closed (other than weekends or holidays) or trading 
on the NYSE is restricted or, to the extent otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act,
if an emergency exists. (b) Not applicable. (c) Not applicable. (d) See Item    
8(a) above.

STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS GROUP CORPORATE BOND RATINGS                        

AAA--Debt rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's Ratings
Group. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.        

AA--Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal
and differs from the higher rated issues only in small degree.                  

A--Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal       
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in   
circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories.     

BBB--Debt rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest  
and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection           
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more      
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for   
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

BB--Debt rated BB has less near-term vulnerability to default than other        
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to         
inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments. The BB      
rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is       
assigned an actual or implied BBB- rating.                                      

B--Debt rated B has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the    
capacity to meet interest payments and principal payments. Adverse business,    
financial, or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to 
pay interest and repay principal. The B rating category is also used for debt   
subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied BB or BB      
rating.                                                                         

CCC--Debt rated CCC has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet   
timely payment of interest and repayment of principal.                          

CC--The rating CC typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that 
is assigned an actual or implied CCC debt rating.                               

C--The rating C typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt which  
is assigned an actual or implied CCC- debt rating. The C rating may be used to  
cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed but debt service   
payments are continued.                                                         

CI--The rating CI is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being    
paid.                                                                           

D--Debt rated D is in payment default. The D rating category is used when       
interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that 
such payments will be made during such grace period. The D rating also will be  
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are      
jeopardized.                                                                    

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., CORPORATE BOND RATINGS                         

AAA--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry 
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as         
"gilt-edged." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally 
stable margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are
likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair 
the fundamentally strong position of such issues.                               

AA--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards. 
Together with the Aaa group, they comprise what are generally known as          
high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuation of protective
elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present     
which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.   

A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are 
to be considered as upper-medium grade obligations. Factors giving security to  
principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present     
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            

BAA--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium-grade obligations (i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured). Interest payments and    
principal security appear adequate for the present, but certain protective      
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and, in  
fact, have speculative characteristics as well.                                 

BA--Bonds which are Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future    
cannot be considered as well-assured. Often the protection of interest and      
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during 
both good and bad times over the future.                                        
Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.                      

B--Bonds which are rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable      
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of   
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.          

CAA--Bonds which are rated Caa are of poor standing. Such issues may be in      
default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or 
interest.                                                                       

CA--Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are speculative in a   
high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.

C--Bonds which are rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so   
rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any  
real investment standing.                                                       

FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS                           

AAA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality. 
The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay       
principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.   

AA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. The
obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong, although  
not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Because bonds rated in the AAA and AA   
categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future developments, 
short-term debt of these issuers is generally rated F-1+.                       

A--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. The      
obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be       
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditionsand 
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                                   

BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality.
The obligator's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be 
adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are
more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds, and, therefore, impair timely
payment. The likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below         
investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.                  

BB--Bonds are considered speculative. The obligor's ability to pay interest and 
repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes. However, 
business and financial alternatives can be identified which couldassist the     
obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.                            

B--Bonds are considered highly speculative. While bonds in this class are       
currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely
payment of principal and interest reflects the limited margin of safety and the 
need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the life of the   
issue.                                                                          

CCC--Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may
lead to default. The ability to meet obligations requires an advantageous       
business and economic environment.                                              

CC--Bonds are minimally protected. Default in payment of interest and/or        
principal seems probable over time.                                             

C--Bonds are in imminent default in payment of interest or principal.           

DDD, DD, AND D--Bonds are in default on interest and/or principal payments. Such
bonds are extremely speculative and should be valued on the basis of their      
ultimate recovery value in liquidation or reorganization of the obligor. DDD    
represents the highest potential for recovery on these bonds, and D represents  
the lowest potential for recovery.

A-1--This designation indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely      
payment is either overwhelming or very strong. Those issues determined to       
possess overwhelming safety characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign    
designation.                                                                    

A-2--Capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is strong.     
However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated  
A-1.                                                                            
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS                       

P-1--Issuers rated PRIME-1 (or related supporting institutions) have a superior 
capacity for repayment of short-term promissory obligations. Prime-1 repayment  
capacity will normally be evidenced by the following characteristics: leading   
market positions in well-established industries; high rates of return on funds  
employed; conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt  
and ample asset protection; broad margins in earning coverage of fixed financial
charges and high internal cash generation; and well-established access to a     
range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity.          

P-2--Issuers rated PRIME-2 (or related supporting institutions) have a strong   
capacity for repayment of short-term promissory obligations. This will normally 
be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree. 
Earnings trends and coverage ratios, while sound, will be more subject to       
variation. Capitalization characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more 
affected by external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.

ITEM 13. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES 

(a) Part A contains additional information about the investment objectives and  
policies and management techniques of the Portfolio. This Part B should only be 
read in conjunction with Part A of the registration statement.                  

Except as stated otherwise, all investment policies and restrictions described  
herein are non-fundamental. Accordingly, the approval of the investors in the   
Portfolio is not required to change any of the investment policies or management
techniques of the Portfolio discussed herein or in Part A of this registration  
statement, unless otherwise indicated.                                          

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS                                                            

The Portfolio endeavors to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a    
professionally managed, diversified portfolio of fixed income securities. Some  
of these fixed income securities may involve equity features. Capital growth    
will be considered, but only when consistent with the investment objective of   
high current income.                                                            

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES                                               

   Corporate debt securities may bear fixed, fixed and contingent, or variable
 rates of interest. They may involve equity features such as conversion or
    exchange rights, warrants for the acquisition of common stock of the same or
  a different issuer, participations based on revenues, sales or profits, or
the purchase of common stock in a unit transaction (where corporate debt
securities and common stock are offered as a unit).                     

Equipment lease or trust certificates are secured obligations issued in 
  serial form, usually sold by transportation companies such as railroads or
airlines, to finance equipment purchases. The certificate holders own a 
    share of the equipment, which can be resold if the issuer of the certificate
   defaults. The Portfolio does not currently intend to invest more than 5% of
its assets in equipment lease certificates.                             

EQUITY SECURITIES                                                       

  Generally, less than 10% of the value of the Portfolio's total assets will
be invested in equity securities, including common stocks, warrants, or 
rights. The Portfolio's investment adviser may choose to exceed this 10%
    limitation if unusual market conditions suggest such investments represent a
better opportunity to reach the Portfolio's investment objective.       

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS                                                   

The Portfolio may also invest in temporary investments for defensive    
purposes during times of unusual market conditions.                             

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT                                                 

   The Portfolio may invest in certificates of deposit of domestic and foreign
banks and savings and loans if they have capital, surplus, and undivided
  profits of over $100,000,000, or if the principal amount of the instrument
is insured by the Bank Insurance Portfolio ("BIF") or the Savings       
  Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF"), both of which are administered by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. These instruments may include    
Eurodollar Certificates of Deposit issued by foreign branches of U.S. or
 foreign banks, Eurodollar Time Deposits which are U.S. dollar-denominated
deposits in foreign branches of U.S. or foreign banks, Canadian Time    
 Deposits which are U.S. dollar-denominated deposits issued by branches of
  major Canadian banks located in the United States, and Yankee Certificates
   of Deposit which are U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit issued
by U.S. branches of foreign banks and held in the United States.

CURRENCY RISK                                                                   

To the extent that debt securities purchased by the Portfolio are       
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, changes in foreign
currency exchange rates will affect the Portfolio's net asset value, the
value of interest earned, gains and losses realized on the sale of      
securities, and net investment income and capital gains, if any, to be  
distributed to shareholders by the Portfolio. If the value of a foreign 
 currency rises against the U.S. dollar, the value of the Portfolio assets
    denominated in that currency will increase; correspondingly, if the value of
   a foreign currency declines against the U.S. dollar, the value of Portfolio
assets denominated in that currency will decrease.                      

The exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies are a 
function of such factors as supply and demand in the currency exchange  
markets, international balances of payments, governmental intervention, 
speculation and other economic and political conditions. Although the   
Portfolio values its assets daily in U.S. dollars, the Portfolio may not
  convert its holdings of foreign currencies to U.S. dollars daily. When the
    Portfolio converts its holdings to another currency, it may incur conversion
costs. Foreign exchange dealers may realize a profit on the difference  
between the price at which they buy and sell currencies.                

The Portfolio may engage in foreign currency exchange transactions in   
 connection with its investments in foreign securities. The Portfolio will
  conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot (i.e.,
cash) basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange
    market, or through forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies.

INVESTING IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES                                                 
FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 

   The Portfolio may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in
 order to protect itself against a possible loss resulting from an adverse
 change in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and a foreign currency
involved in an underlying transaction. However, forward foreign currency
exchange contracts may limit potential gains which could result from a  
  positive change in such currency relationships. The Portfolio's investment
   adviser believes that it is important to have the flexibility to enter into
  forward foreign currency exchange contracts whenever it determines that it
is in the Portfolio's best interest to do so. The Portfolio will not    
speculate in foreign currency exchange.                                 

  There is no limitation as to the percentage of the Portfolio's assets that
may be committed to such contracts.                                             

The Portfolio does not enter into forward foreign currency exchange     
 contracts or maintain a net exposure in such contracts when the Portfolio
    would be obligated to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the
    value of the Portfolio's portfolio securities or other assets denominated in
  that currency or, in the case of a "cross-hedge" denominated in a currency
   or currencies that the Portfolio's adviser believes will tend to be closely
   correlated with the currency with regard to price movements. Generally, the
  Portfolio does not enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract
with a term longer than one year.                                       

FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS                                                

    A foreign currency option provides the option buyer with the right to buy or
sell a stated amount of foreign currency at the exercise price on a     
  specified date or during the option period. The owner of a call option has
the right, but not the obligation, to buy the currency. Conversely, the 
owner of a put option has the right, but not the obligation to sell the 
currency.                                                               

When the option is exercised, the seller (i.e., writer) of the option is
obligated to fulfill the terms of the sold option. However, either the  
   seller or the buyer may, in the secondary market, close its position during
the option period at any time prior to expiration.                      

    A call option on foreign currency generally rises in value if the underlying
currency appreciates in value, and a put option on foreign currency     
 generally falls in value if the underlying currency depreciates in value.
Although purchasing a foreign currency option can protect the Portfolio 
  against an adverse movement in the value of a foreign currency, the option
  will not limit the movement in the value of such currency. For example, if
    the Portfolio were holding securities denominated in a foreign currency that
    was appreciating and had purchased a foreign currency put to hedge against a
decline in the value of the currency, the Portfolio would not have to   
exercise its put option. Likewise, if the Portfolio were to enter into a
contract to purchase a security denominated in foreign currency and, in 
conjunction with that purchase, were to purchase a foreign currency call
    option to hedge against a rise in value of the currency, and if the value of
the currency instead depreciated between the date of purchase and the   
    settlement date, the Portfolio would not have to exercise its call. Instead,
the Portfolio could acquire in the spot market the amount of foreign    
currency needed for settlement.                                         

SPECIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS                  

    Buyers and sellers of foreign currency options are subject to the same risks
that apply to options generally.                                                

In addition, there are certain additional risks associated with foreign 
currency options. The markets in foreign currency options are relatively
new, and the Portfolio's ability to establish and close out positions on
such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid secondary market.
 Although the Portfolio will not purchase or write such options unless and
 until, in the opinion of the Portfolio's adviser, the market for them has
developed sufficiently to ensure that the risks in connection with such 
options are not greater than the risks in connection with the underlying
currency, there can be no assurance that a liquid secondary market will 
exist for a particular option at any specific time.                     

In addition, options on foreign currencies are affected by all of those 
factors that influence foreign exchange rates and investments generally.

The value of a foreign currency option depends upon the value of the    
  underlying currency relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the price of
the option position may vary with changes in the value of either or both
currencies and may have no relationship to the investment merits of a   
foreign security. Because foreign currency transactions occurring in the
    interbank market involve substantially larger amounts than those that may be
involved in the use of foreign currency options, investors may be       
  disadvantaged by having to deal in an odd lot market (generally consisting
of transactions of less than $1 million) for the underlying foreign     
currencies at prices that are less favorable than for round lots.       

There is no systematic reporting of last sale information for foreign   
  currencies or any regulatory requirement that quotations available through
dealers or other market sources be firm or revised on a timely basis.   

 Available quotation information is generally representative of very large
transactions in the interbank market and thus may not reflect relatively
smaller transactions (i.e. less than $1 million) where rates may be less
favorable. The interbank market in foreign currencies is a global,      
around-the-clock market. To the extent that the U.S. option markets are 
closed while the markets for the underlying currencies remain open,     
significant price and rate movements may take place in the underlying   
  markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets until they reopen.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                           

The Portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to
repurchase agreements, and these securities will be marked to market daily. In  
the event that a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent,    
disposition of such securities by the Portfolio might be delayed pending court  
action. The Portfolio believes that under the regular procedures normally in    
effect for custody of the Portfolio's portfolio securities subject to repurchase
agreements, a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the        
Portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities. The Portfolio  
will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized      
financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are deemed by the         
Portfolio's adviser to be creditworthy, pursuant to guidelines established by   
the Trustees.                                                                   

REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                   

The Portfolio may enter into reverse repurchase agreements. These transactions  
are similar to borrowing cash. In a reverse repurchase agreement, the Portfolio 
transfers possession of a portfolio instrument to another person, such as a     
financial institution, broker, or dealer, in return for a percentage of the     
instrument's market value in cash, and agrees that on a stipulated date in the  
future the Portfolio will repurchase the portfolio instrument by remitting the  
original consideration plus interest at an agreed upon rate.                    

When effecting reverse repurchase agreements, liquid assets of the Portfolio, in
a dollar amount sufficient to make payment for the obligations to be purchased, 
are segregated at the trade date. These securities are marked to market daily   
and maintained until the transaction is settled.                                

P-->POS AMI4th�"Page"�of�10TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS                                   

These transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous  
price or yield for the Portfolio. No fees or other expenses, other than normal  
transaction costs, are incurred. However, liquid assets of the Portfolio        
sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on 
the Portfolio's records at the trade date. These assets are marked to market    
daily and are maintained until the transaction has been settled. The Portfolio  
does not intend to engage in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions to an
extent that would cause the segregation of more than 20% of the total value of  
its assets.                                                                     

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                                 

In order to generate additional income, the Portfolio may lend its portfolio    
securities, up to one-third of the value of its total assets, to broker/dealers,
banks, or other institutional borrowers of securities.                          

The collateral received when the Portfolio lends portfolio securities must be   
valued daily and, should the market value of the loaned securities increase, the
borrower must furnish additional collateral to the Portfolio. During the time   
portfolio securities are on loan, the borrower pays the Portfolio any dividends 
or interest paid on such securities. Loans are subject to termination at the    
option of the Portfolio or the borrower. The Portfolio may pay reasonable       
administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a       
negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash or cash equivalent        
collateral to the borrower or placing broker. The Portfolio does not have the   
right to vote securities on loan, but would terminate the loan and regain the   
right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment. 

RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                              

The ability of the Trustees to determine the liquidity of certain restricted    
securities is permitted under a Securities and Exchange Commission staff        
position set forth in the adopting release for Rule 144A under the Securities   
Act of 1933. The Trustees consider the following criteria in determining the    
liquidity of certain restricted securities:                                     

o  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security;             

     o  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the
number of other potential buyers;                             

o  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and        

   o  the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades.

(B)   INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS                                                    

The following investment limitations cannot be changed without shareholder      
approval.                                                                       
SELLING SHORT AND BUYING ON MARGIN                                      

   The Portfolio will not sell any securities short or purchase any securities
 on margin, but may obtain such short-term credits as may be necessary for
clearance of purchases and sales of portfolio securities.               

ISSUING SENIOR SECURITIES AND BORROWING MONEY                           

    The Portfolio will not issue senior securities except that the Portfolio may
borrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements as a     
  temporary, extraordinary, or emergency measure to facilitate management of
    the portfolio by enabling the Portfolio to meet redemption requests when the
liquidation of portfolio securities is deemed to be inconvenient or     
   disadvantageous, and then only in amounts not in excess of one-third of the
value of its total assets; provided that, while borrowings and reverse  
    repurchase agreements outstanding exceed 5% of the Portfolio's total assets,
  any such borrowings will be repaid before additional investments are made.
The Portfolio will not borrow money or engage in reverse repurchase     
agreements for investment leverage purposes.                            

PLEDGING ASSETS                                                         

    The Portfolio will not mortgage, pledge, or hypothecate any assets except to
secure permitted borrowings. In those cases, it may mortgage, pledge or 
hypothecate assets having a market value not exceeding the lesser of the
   dollar amounts borrowed or 15% of the value of its total assets at the time
of borrowing.                                                           

CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS                                            

    The Portfolio will not purchase securities if, as a result of such purchase,
25% or more of its total assets would be invested in any one industry.  
However, the Portfolio may at any time invest 25% or more of its total  
   assets in cash or cash items and securities issued and/or guaranteed by the
U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.                     

INVESTING IN COMMODITIES                                                

    The Portfolio will not purchase or sell commodities, commodity contracts, or
commodity futures contracts.                                                    

INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE                                                

   The Portfolio will not purchase or sell real estate, although it may invest
  in securities of companies whose business involves the purchase or sale of
real estate or in securities secured by real estate or interests in real
estate.                                                                 

LENDING CASH OR SECURITIES                                              

  The Portfolio will not lend any of its assets, except portfolio securities
 up to one-third of its total assets. This shall not prevent the Portfolio
  from purchasing or holding corporate or U.S. government bonds, debentures,
  notes, certificates of indebtedness or other debt securities of an issuer,
    entering into repurchase agreements, or engaging in other transactions which
 are permitted by the Portfolio's investment objective and policies or the
Trust's Declaration of Trust.                                           

UNDERWRITING                                                            

   The Portfolio will not underwrite any issue of securities, except as it may
be deemed to be an underwriter under the Securities Act of 1933 in      
connection with the sale of securities in accordance with its investment
objective, policies, and limitations.                                   

DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENTS                                          

    With respect to 75% of its total assets, the Portfolio will not purchase the
securities of any one issuer (other than cash, cash items, or securities
issued and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or        
instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements collateralized by such     
securities) if, as a result, more than 5% of its total assets would be  
invested in the securities of that issuer. Also, the Portfolio will not 
   purchase more than 10% of any class of the outstanding voting securities of
    any one issuer. For these purposes, the Portfolio considers common stock and
all preferred stock of an issuer each as a single class, regardless of  
priorities, series, designations, or other differences.                 

(c) The following limitations may be changed by the Trustees without shareholder
approval. Shareholders will be notified before any material changes in these    
limitations become effective.                                                   

RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                      

   The Portfolio will not invest more than 15% of its total assets in illiquid
    securities, including repurchase agreements providing for settlement in more
than seven days after notice and certain restricted securities not      
determined by the Trustees to be liquid.                                

Except with respect to borrowing money, if a percentage limitation is adhered to
at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting 
from any change in value of total or net assets will not result in a violation  
of such restriction.                                                            

The Portfolio has no present intention to borrow money in excess of 5% of the   
value of its net assets during the coming fiscal year.                          

For purposes of its policies and limitations, the Portfolio considers           
certificates of deposit and demand and time deposits issued by a U.S. branch of 
a domestic bank or savings association having capital, surplus, and undivided   
profits in excess of $100,000,000 at the time of investment to be "cash items."

(ii)  See Item 14 above.                                            
 (iii) The Trust and the Adviser are parties to an investment advisory
agreement dated January 1, 1998 (the "Advisory Agreement"), which provides that 
the Adviser will not charge an advisory fee.                                    

(b) Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, investment management decisions for the 
Portfolio are made by the Adviser subject to the direction by the Trustees. The 
Adviser continually conducts investment research and supervision for the        
Portfolio and is responsible for the purchase and sale of portfolio instruments.
The Adviser receives no fee for its investment management services.             

Under the Advisory Agreement, the Portfolio bears the cost of administrative    
accounting services, which includes maintaining its financial books and records 
and calculating its daily net asset value. See Item 16(d).                      

(c) Not applicable.                                                             

(d) Federated Services Company (the "Administrator"), a subsidiary of Federated

(e) Not applicable.                                                             

(f) Not applicable.                                                             

(g) Not applicable.                                                             

(h) State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.O. Box 8600, Boston, Massachusetts

(i) Federated Shareholder Services Company acts as the Portfolio's transfer     
agent and receives a fee based on the size, type and number of accounts and     
transactions made by shareholders.                                              

ITEM 17. BROKERAGE ALLOCATION AND OTHER PRACTICES 

(a) Research services provided by brokers and dealers may be used by the        
investment managers or by their affiliates in advising the Portfolio and other  
accounts. To the extent that receipt of these services may supplant services for
which the investment managers or their affiliates might otherwise have paid, it 
would tend to reduce their expenses.                                            

The Portfolio's purchase and sales of securities may be principal transactions, 
that is, securities may be purchased directly from the issuer or from an        
underwriter or market maker for the securities. There usually are no brokerage  
commissions paid for such purchases and, therefore, the Portfolio does not      
anticipate paying brokerage commissions in such transactions. Any transactions  
for which the Portfolio pays a brokerage commission will be effected at the best
price and execution available. Purchases from underwriters of securities include
a commission or concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter, and purchases 
from dealers serving as market makers include the spread between the bid and the
asked price.                                                                    

Allocations of transactions, including their frequency, to various dealers is   
determined by the investment managers in their best judgment and in a manner    
deemed to be in the best interest of the investors in the Portfolio rather than 
by any formula. The primary consideration is prompt execution of orders in an   
effective manner at the most favorable price.                                   

The Advisory Agreement provides that, in executing portfolio transactions and   
selecting brokers or dealers, the investment managers will seek to obtain the   
best net price and the most favorable execution. The investment managers shall  
consider factors they deem relevant, including the breadth of the market in the 
security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution      
capability of the broker or dealer, and the reasonableness of the commission, if
any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis.                    

In addition, the Advisory Agreement authorizes the investment managers, to the  
extent permitted by law and subject to the review of Trust's Trustees, to cause 
the Portfolio to pay a broker which furnishes brokerage and research services a 
higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker for        
effecting the same transaction, provided that the investment managers determine 
in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research services provided by such broker, viewed in terms of     
either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the       
investment managers to the accounts as to which they exercise investment        
discretion. Such brokerage and research services might consist of reports and   
statistics on specific companies or industries, general summaries of groups of  
stocks and their comparative earnings, or broad overviews of the stock market   
and the economy. Such services might also include reports on global, regional,  
and country-by-country prospects for economic growth, anticipated levels of     
inflation, prevailing and expected interest rates, and the outlook for currency 
relationships.                                                                  

Supplementary research information so received is in addition to and not in lieu
of services required to be performed by the investment managers and does not    
reduce the investment advisory fees (if any) payable by the Portfolio. Such     
information may be useful to the investment managers in serving the Portfolio   
and other clients and, conversely, supplemental information obtained by the     
placement of business of other clients may be useful to the investment managers 
in carrying out their obligations to the Portfolio.                             

Investment decisions for the Portfolio will be made independently from those for
any other account or investment company that is or may in the future become     
managed by its investment managers or any of their affiliates. If, however, the 
Portfolio and other investment companies or accounts managed by the same        
investment manager are contemporaneously engaged in the purchase or sales of the
same security, the transactions may be averaged as to price and allocated       
equitably to each account. In some cases, this policy might adversely affect the
price paid or received by the Portfolio or the size of the position obtainable  
for the Portfolio. In addition, when purchases or sales of the same security for
the Portfolio and for other investment companies managed by the same investment 
manager occur contemporaneously, the purchase or sale orders may be aggregated  
in order to obtain any price advantages available to large denomination         
purchases or sales. Furthermore, in certain circumstances affiliates of the     
investment managers whose investment portfolios are managed internally, rather  
than by the investment managers, might seek to purchase or sell the same type of
investments at the same time as the Portfolio. Such an event might also         
adversely affect the Portfolio.                                                 

(b) None.                                                                       

(c) See response to (a).                                                        

(d) Not applicable.                                                             

(e) Not applicable.                                                             

ITEM 18.  CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES 

(a)  See Item 6.                                                                

Under certain circumstances, shareholders may be held personally liable as      
partners under Massachusetts law for obligations of the Trust. To protect its   
shareholders, the Trust has filed legal documents with Massachusetts that       
expressly disclaim the liability of its shareholders for acts or obligations of 
the Trust. These documents require notice of this disclaimer to be given in each
agreement, obligation, or instrument the Trust or its Trustees enter into or    
sign.                                                                           

In the unlikely event a shareholder is held personally liable for the Trust's   
obligations, the Trust is required by the Declaration of Trust to use its       
property to protect or compensate the shareholder. On request, the Trust will   
defend any claim made and pay any judgment against a shareholder for any act or 
obligation of the Trust. Therefore, financial loss resulting from liability as a
shareholder will occur only if the Trust itself cannot meet its obligations to  
indemnify shareholders and pay judgments against them.                          

(b) Not applicable.                                                             

ITEM 19.  PURCHASE, REDEMPTION, AND PRICING OF SECURITIES BEING OFFERED 

(a) Beneficial interests in the Portfolio are issued solely in private placement
transactions that do not involve any "public offering" within the meaning of    
Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. See Item 4 in Part A of this Registration         
Statement.                                                                      

(b) See Item 7.                                                                 

(c) Not applicable.

ITEM 27.    INDEMNIFICATION: 

   Indemnification is provided to Officers and Trustees of the
       Registrant pursuant to Section 2 of Article XII of Registrant's
          Declaration of Trust. The Investment Advisory Contract between the
          Registrant and Federated Research Corp. ("Adviser") provides that,
           in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence,
    or reckless disregard of the obligations or duties under the
          Investment Advisory Contract on the part of Adviser, Adviser shall
            not be liable to the Registrant or to any shareholder for any act or
        omission in the course of or connected in any way with rendering
         services or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase,
            holding, or sale of any security. Registrant's Trustees and Officers
       are covered by an Investment Trust Errors and Omissions Policy.

    Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
          Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to Trustees, Officers, and
           controlling persons of the Registrant by the Registrant pursuant to
           the Declaration of Trust or otherwise, the Registrant is aware that
      in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
        indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act
       and, therefore, is unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
           indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
           the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by Trustees), Officers,
       or controlling persons of the Registrant in connection with the
          successful defense of any act, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by
          such Trustees, Officers, or controlling persons in connection with
       the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the
         opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
    precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
            question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy
 as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issues.                            

            Insofar as indemnification for liabilities may be permitted pursuant
         to Section 17 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for Trustees,
  Officers, and controlling persons of the Registrant by the
         Registrant pursuant to the Declaration of Trust or otherwise, the
          Registrant is aware of the position of the Securities and Exchange
     Commission as set forth in Investment Company Act Release No.
          IC-11330. Therefore, the Registrant undertakes that in addition to
            complying with the applicable provisions of the Declaration of Trust
           or otherwise, in the absence of a final decision on the merits by a
            court or other body before which the proceeding was brought, that an
         indemnification payment will not be made unless in the absence of
      such a decision, a reasonable determination based upon factual
            review has been made (i) by a majority vote of a quorum of non-party
            Trustees who are not interested persons of the Registrant or (ii) by
          independent legal counsel in a written opinion that the indemnitee
          was not liable for an act of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
           negligence, or reckless disregard of duties. The Registrant further
            undertakes that advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of a
          proceeding (upon undertaking for repayment unless it is ultimately
           determined that indemnification is appropriate) against an Officer,
         Trustee, or controlling person of the Registrant will not be made
           absent the fulfillment of at least one of the following conditions:
          (i) the indemnitee provides security for his undertaking; (ii) the
            Registrant is insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful
            advances; or (iii) a majority of a quorum of disinterested non-party
          Trustees or independent legal counsel in a written opinion makes a
            factual determination that there is reason to believe the indemnitee
will be entitled to indemnification.
