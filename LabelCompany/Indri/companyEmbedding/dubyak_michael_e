TIGERS Roar for CEO Michael E. Dubyak
 by Dianne Crampton | Sep 11, 2012 | awards, team development, TIGERS Roar, Work Environment | 0 comments
 

Summary: Wright Express Chairman, President and CEO Michael E. Dubyak is selected as Maine Development Foundation’s 2012 Champion of Education, Training and Leadership Development
 
At TIGERS any time a leader is tapped for promoting education, training and leadership development we think this is a big deal. For one, too many organizations cut back on training and development during the recession. As a result many employees’s skills have stagnated.  This makes companies that have cut back more risky as we emerge from the recession. For another,  Unions use to provide excellent training programs for their members. Sadly we do not hear much about that anymore. 
 
So when we learned that a  leading global provider of value-based business payment processing and information management solutions, announced its chairman, president and CEO, Michael E. Dubyak, was selected by the Maine Development Foundation as the 2012 “Champion of Education, Training and Leadership Development” we wanted to learn more.
 
The award honors an individual or organization that has gone above and beyond to spark Maine’s economy and help all Maine citizens reach their highest personal potential. Since one of our certified and licensed TIGERS Facilitators, Tony Lacertosa,  works out of Maine, this is a double big deal.

“I am humbled by this award and recognition,” said Dubyak. “I am passionate about trying to align higher education ― and now K-16 ― with Maine businesses and the growing need for STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) graduates. Maine businesses and the state educational systems must work in partnership if we are to properly train and retain our high school students that come through our college and university systems.”
With over 600 employees in the greater Portland area, Wright Express takes an active leadership role in supporting organizations that promote economic, educational and personal development opportunities. Dubyak is currently the Chairman of Educate Maine, a business-led organization whose mission is to champion college and career readiness and increased education attainment.
“We greatly appreciate all that Mike does for Maine,” said Ed Cervone, Maine Development Foundation interim executive director. “He has demonstrated the ability to collaborate and create successful partnerships across business and academic sectors. His ideas and leadership are truly making a difference in Maine.”
Dubyak sits on the University of Southern Maine Foundation’s Board of Directors. Previously, Dubyak served as chairman of the University of Southern Maine’s Board of Visitors. Dubyak has also served on the United Way of Greater Portland’s Board of Directors, the Governor’s Council on Competitiveness and the Economy, the New England Advisory Council of the Boston Federal Reserve, and the Maine Chamber of Commerce’s Executive Board. Additionally, Dubyak served on the Center for Grieving Children’s Board of Directors and co-chaired its Capital Campaign.
A special reception to honor the five 2012 Maine Development Foundation “Champions” will be held on September 21 at the Holiday Inn By The Bay in Portland, Maine, during the organization’s 34th annual meeting.
So, join us in a TIGERS Roar for Michael E. Dubyak and his team.
Do you have a leadership story we can roar about? Let us know.

September 10, 2012 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wright 
      Express Corporation (NYSE: WXS), a leading global provider of 
      value-based business payment processing and information management 
      solutions, today announced its chairman, president and CEO, Michael E. 
      Dubyak, was selected by the Maine Development Foundation as the 2012 
      “Champion of Education, Training and Leadership Development.” The award 
      honors an individual or organization that has gone above and beyond to 
      spark Maine’s economy and help all Maine citizens reach their highest 
      personal potential.
    


      “I am humbled by this award and recognition,” said Dubyak. “I am 
      passionate about trying to align higher education ― and now K-16 ― with 
      Maine businesses and the growing need for STEM (science, technology, 
      engineering and math) graduates. Maine businesses and the state 
      educational systems must work in partnership if we are to properly train 
      and retain our high school students that come through our college and 
      university systems.”
    

      With over 600 employees in the greater Portland area, Wright Express 
      takes an active leadership role in supporting organizations that promote 
      economic, educational and personal development opportunities. Dubyak is 
      currently the Chairman of Educate Maine, a business-led organization 
      whose mission is to champion college and career readiness and increased 
      education attainment.
    

      “We greatly appreciate all that Mike does for Maine,” said Ed Cervone, 
      Maine Development Foundation interim executive director. “He has 
      demonstrated the ability to collaborate and create successful 
      partnerships across business and academic sectors. His ideas and 
      leadership are truly making a difference in Maine.”
    

      Dubyak sits on the University of Southern Maine Foundation’s Board of 
      Directors. Previously, Dubyak served as chairman of the University of 
      Southern Maine’s Board of Visitors. Dubyak has also served on the United 
      Way of Greater Portland’s Board of Directors, the Governor’s Council on 
      Competitiveness and the Economy, the New England Advisory Council of the 
      Boston Federal Reserve, and the Maine Chamber of Commerce’s Executive 
      Board. Additionally, Dubyak served on the Center for Grieving Children’s 
      Board of Directors and co-chaired its Capital Campaign.
    

      A special reception to honor the five 2012 Maine Development Foundation 
      “Champions” will be held on September 21 at the Holiday Inn By The Bay 
      in Portland, Maine, during the organization’s 34th annual 
      meeting.
