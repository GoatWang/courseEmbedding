Explanatory Note                                                                

    Registrant, on or about March 6, 1978, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") a Notification of Registration on Form N-8A under   
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").  On or about   
March 14, 1978, Registrant filed with the SEC its Registration Statement        
pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act on Form N-8B-1 and its initial            
Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the        
"1933 Act") on Form S-5 (Registration No. 2-60951), hereinafter "Registrant's   
S-5."  Registration of shares covered by such S-5 Registration Statement was    
accomplished as part of Registrant's Form N-1 Registration Statement,           
declared effective by order of the Commission on July 1, 1980.                  

     In June 1978, by virtue of resignations of the Trustees of The Copley
Trust (formerly Steadman Tax-Sheltered Trust), a common law business trust      
(the "Trust") and an investment company registered under the 1940 Act, the      
President of Registrant became the sole trustee of the Trust; and,              
subsequently, by action of the Trust's shareholders at a meeting duly called    
and held and for which proxies were solicited in accordance with the 1940       
Act Rules 20a-1, 20a-2, and 20a-3, the shareholders re-elected said President   
as a trustee as well as other new trustees and took such other action,          
including the appointment of auditors, the selection of an investment           
advisor, etc., as was necessary to provide for the continuity of the Trust.     

On July 23, 1979, the Trust filed with the SEC its initial      
Registration Statement on Form N-1, styled as Post-Effective Amendment No. 3    
to its 1933 Act Registration Statement on Form S-5 (Registration No. 2-55344),  
Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to its 1933 Act Registration Statement on        
Form S-5 (Registration No. 2-61740) and Amendment No. 1 to its Registration     
Statement pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act on Form N-8B-1 (the "Trust's    
N-1").  The Trust's N-1 was included in, and became effective as, a part of     
Registrant's Form N-1 Registration Statement, declared effective by order       
of the Commission dated July 1, 1980.                                           

On or about February 24, 1980, in connection with the change of 
domicile of the Trust, Registrant acquired all of the assets of the Trust       
and assumed all of its liabilities pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of         
Reorganization, dated as of December 3, 1979 (the "Agreement"), in exchange     
for that number of shares of Registrant's common stock (par value $1.00 per     
share) as was equal to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the        
Trust on the "Reorganization Date," February 27, 1980.  The Trust has since     
wound up its business, dissolved and credited or delivered the shares of        
Registrant to its shareholders on or as of the Reorganization Date.  The        
Agreement was approved by the shareholders of the Trust at its annual           
meeting, duly called and held on February 14, 1980, and for which proxies       
were solicited in accordance with 1940 Act Rule 20a-1, et seq.

Pursuant to Rule 414 under the 1933 Act, in its Registration    
Statement on Form N-1, declared effective by order of the Commission on         
July 1, 1980, Registrant adopted as its own registration statements, for        
all purposes of the 1933 Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the       
Trust's Registration Statement Nos. 2-55344 and 2-61740, and Registrant

Registrant, having adopted the Trust's Registration Statements  
Nos. 2-55344 and 2-61740, intends this Amendment to said Registration           
Statements to constitute compliance with the Trust's undertakings to amend      
such Registration Statements in lieu of filing separate amendments.             
Registrant also intends for this Registration Statement to constitute           
compliance with its undertakings to amend its Registration Statement No.        
2-60951 in lieu of filing a separate amendment.

COPLEY FUND, INC.               
GOALS AND STRATEGIES                                                            
GOALS                                                                           
-------                                                                         
The Fund's investment goals are the accumulation of dividend income and         
long-term capital appreciation.                                                 

STRATEGIES                                                                      
-----------                                                                     
The Fund uses its corporate structure to create dividend income to the Fund     
by utilizing the Fund's 70% deduction from federal income taxes for dividends   
received.  The remaining 30% of the Fund's income is used primarily to pay      
for expenses of running the Fund.  The result, unless the Federal accumulated   
earnings tax is imposed on the Fund, is that the federal income taxes that      
would otherwise be payable by the fund are greatly reduced (see Main Risks).    

The fund's policy of maximizing dividend income together with its structure     
enable the fund's assets to be managed so as to avoid the necessity of          
making annual taxable distributions to shareholders.  Dividends and capital     
gains are not distributed, but rather are accumulated within the fund and       
are added to the value of each share on a daily basis.  Any increase in         
per share value directly raises the value of each shareholder's account.        
Upon redemption the shareholder will incur a loss or realize a gain or income   
which may be subject to income taxation depending upon per share value at       
the time of redemption.                                                         

THE FUND IS TAXED AS A CORPORATION, AND DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS ARE         
NOT DISTRIBUTED BUT RATHER ACCUMULATED WITHIN THE FUND AND ARE ADDED TO         
THE VALUE OF EACH SHARE ON A DAILY BASIS.                                       

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS    The fund will normally invest substantially all of     
its assets in the equity securities of (1) companies with strong balance        
sheets and with histories of dividend increases and (2) companies whose         
earnings growth potential enhances prospects for future increases in dividend   
rates.  The Manager expects that more than 80% of the fund's assets will be     
invested in such equity securities.  These types of securities generally        
entitle the holder to participate in a company's general operating results.     
These include common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible securities.       

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS    The manager may take a temporary defensive position    
when it believes the markets or the economy are experiencing excessive          
volatility or a prolonged general decline, or other adverse conditions exist.   
Under these circumstances the fund may be unable to pursue its investment       
goals because it may not invest or may not invest in equity securities.  At     
such times, or in the event of exceptional redemption requests, the fund may    
hold cash or cash-equivelants and invest without limit in money market          
securities, U.S. government obligations and short term debt securities.

OPERATING BUSINESS      In an effort to enhance its performance and to          
preserve and promote its investment goal in the context of adverse tax law      
changes more fully discussed under "Main Risks" the fund has engaged, on a      
limited basis, in the luggage and related products business.  In order to       
maintain the fund's status as a diversified investment company the value of     
the operating business is limited to 24% or less of the fund's total assets     
and the gross profit therefrom is limited to 10% or less of the fund's total    
annual gross income.                                                            

MAIN RISKS 
---------------                                                                 

STOCKS   While stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over   
the long term, they tend to go up and down more dramatically over the shorter   
term.  These price movements may result from factors affecting individual       
companies, industries or the securities market as a whole.                      

INTEREST RATE   When interest rates rise, debt security prices fall. When       
interest rates fall, debt security prices go up.                                

** BECAUSE THE SECURITIES THE FUND HOLDS FLUXUATE IN PRICE, THE VALUE OF        
YOUR INVESTMENT WILL GO UP AND DOWN.  THIS MEANS YOU COULD LOSE MONEY OVER      
SHORT OR EVEN EXTENDED PERIODS.                                                 

Generally, interest rates rise during times of inflation or a growing           
economy, and will fall during an economic slowdown or recession.  Securities    
with longer maturities usually are more sensitive to interest rate changes      
than securities with shorter maturities.                                        

UTILITIES INDUSTRY    While the fund does not concentrate its assets in         
any one industry it may, at times, have a substantial portion of its assets     
invested in utility companies.  At such times the fund's performance is         
closely tied to conditions affecting the public utilities industry, which       
may change rapidly. Utility company securities are particularly sensitive       
to interest rate movements; when interest rates rise, the stock prices of       
these companies tend to fall.  On-going regulatory changes have led to          
greater competition in the industry and the emergenge of non-regulated          
providers as a significant part of the industry which may make some companies   
less profitable.  In addition, the industry is subject to risks associated      
with the difficulty of obtaining adequate returns on invested capital in spite  
of frequent rate increases and of financing large construction programs         
during inflationary periods; restrictions on operations and increased costs     
due to environmental and safety regulations; difficulties of the capital

OPERATING BUSINESS      The manager believes that the conduct of the operating  
business eliminates or, at the least, minimizes the risk that the fund will     
be subject to federal accumulated earnings tax.  In the event the manager's     
position is found wrong by the IRS or changes are made to existing tax laws     
and regulations the fund could be held liable for accumulated earnings tax      
by the IRS.  In this event the fund's net asset value would be reduced          
by any such liability and each shareholder would incur a proportionate          
decrease in the value of their account.                                         

FOREIGN SECURITIES     Securities of companies and governments located          
outside the U.S. may involve risks that can increase the potential for losses   
in the fund.  Investments in Depositary Receipts also involve some or all       
of the following risks.                                                         

Country.  General securities market movements in any country where the fund     
has investments are likely to affect the value of the securities the fund       
owns which trade in that country.  These movements will affect the fund's       
share price and fund performance.                                               

The political, economic and social structures of some countries the fund        
invests in may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S.          
The risks of investing in these countries include the possibility of the        
imposition of exchange controls, currency devaluations, foreign ownership       
limitations, expropriation, restrictions on removal of currency or other        
assets, nationalization of assets, punitive taxeS and certain custody and       
settlement risks.                                                               

The fund's investments in developing or emerging markets are subject to all     
of the risks of foreign investing generally, and have additional heightened     
risks due to a lack of established legal, business and social frameworks        
to support securities markets.  Foreign securities markets, including           
emerging markets, may have substantially lower trading volumes than U.S.        
markets, resulting in less liquidity and more volatility than experienced       
in the U.S.  While short term volatility in these markets can be                
disconcerting, declines in excess of 50% are not unusual.                       

** IF A SECURITY'S CREDIT RATING IS DOWNGRADED OR A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL         
CONDITION DETERIORATES, THE PRICE OF THE SECURITY WILL FALL AND SO TOO          
WILL THE FUND'S SHARE PRICE.  IF INTEREST RATES RISE, THE VALUE OF THE          
FUND'S DEBT SECURITIES WILL ALSO FALL.  BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE FUND'S         
HOLDINGS FLUCTUATES IN PRICE, THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUND          
WILL GO UP AND DOWN.  THIS MEANS YOU COULD LOSE MONEY OVER SHORT OR EVEN        
EXTENDED PERIODS.

YEAR 2000     When evaluating current and potential portfolio positions,        
Year 2000 is one of the factors the fund's manager considers.                   

The manager will rely upon public filings and other statements made by          
companies about their Year 2000 readiness.  Issuers in countries outside        
the U.S., particularly in emerging markets, may not be required to make the     
same level of disclosure about Year 2000 readiness as is required in the U.S.   
The manager, of course, cannot audit each company and its major suppliers       
to verify their Year 2000 readiness.                                            

If a company in which the fund is invested is adversely affected by Year        
2000 problems, it is likely that the price of its security will also be         
adversely affected.  A decrease in the value of one or more of the              
fund's portfolio holdings will have a similar impact on the price of the        
fund's shares and the fund's performance.  Please see section on "Year 2000     
Problems" for more information.                                                 

**  Mutual fund shares are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or     
endorsed by, any bank, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit     
Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the

Copley Financial Services, Inc. (Manager) P.O. Box 3287, Fall River,            
Massachusetts, 02722 is the fund's investment manager.                          

Mr. Irving Levine is responsible for the fund's management.  He is president    
of the manager and has managed the fund since its inception in 1978.            

For its services the manager received a fee of ___% of average net assets       
during the last fiscal year.                                                    

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS                                                            
DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES                                                         
-------------------------                                                       

The fund does not normally make income or capital gains distributions.  It      
is taxed as a regular corporation under the Internal Revenue Code.              
Accordingly, the Fund retains all net investment income and realized            
capital gains, if any, to increase the fund's net assets.  Consequently,        
shareholders are not individually liable for income taxes associated with       
the operations of the fund except upon sale of shares or the receipt of         
distributions.                                                                  

The fund is taxed, for Federal income tax purposes, on a schedule of rates      
ranging from 15% to 34% depending upon its taxable income.  However, a 5%       
additional tax rate applies to phase out the benefits of the graduated          
rates if the Fund's taxable income is between $100,000 and $335,000.            
Subject to specific limitations, the Fund is entitled to a deduction in         
computing its Federal taxable income equal to 70% of the amount of dividends    
received by the Fund from domestic corporations.  This dividends received       
deduction may not exceed 70% of the Fund's taxable income unless the Fund       
has a net operating loss for a taxable year, as computed after deducting the    
dividend received deduction.  It is anticipated, although there can be no       
assurance, that the Fund's management fees and other expenses may offset        
a substantial portion of the remaining 30% of the dividend income and           
investment income from other sources during each taxable year.                  

The Fund pays income taxes on any net realized capital gain at the statutory    
rate noted above.  In addition, the Fund will, for financial statement          
purposes, accrue deferred income taxes on net unrealized capital gains that     
are expected to be realized at the Fund level.  The Fund may carry net capital  
losses forward for five years as an offset against any net capital gains        
realized by the Fund during the current year.                                   

Legislative or regulatory changes in, or interpretations of, applicable         
federal tax laws, regulations or rulings may make it impossible for the         
Fund to utilize certain of the tax management techniques and strategies         
described in the Prospectus.  The Fund intends to evaluate continuously the     
operations of the Fund under the current federal tax laws as well as various    
alternatives available.

ACCUMULATED EARNINGS TAX     Since the Fund accumulates rather than             
distributes its income, the Fund may be subject to the imposition of the        
Federal accumulated earnings tax (the "AET").  The AET is imposed on a          
corporation's accumulated taxable income (the "ATT") for each taxable year      
at the rate of 39.6%.  ATI is defined as the adjusted taxable income of         
the Fund minus the sum of the dividends paid deduction and the accumulated      
earnings credit.  The dividends paid deduction and the accumulated earnings     
credit is available only if the fund is not held to be a "mere holding or       
investment company."                                                            

In the early part of 1987, the Fund commenced activities in the luggage         
and related products trade business.  The business is being operated as         
a division of the Fund.  The value of business assets and their earnings        
are included in the net assets of the Fund.  The assets of the operating        
division should not result in the Fund ceasing to be an open-end investment     
company under the Act.  Management believes that under existing law the         
Fund's operation of its active trade or business prevent the Fund from          
being classified as a "mere holding or investment company" for purpose of the   
AET.  Under that proposition, the Fund is entitled to a dividends paid          
deduction from ATI for that portion of Fund redemptions representing the        
amount of undistributed earnings accumulated since the inception of the         
Fund and through the date of redemption allocable to the redeemed shares.       

The Internal Revenue Service has recently uphelod the manager's position that   
the Fund is not a mere holding or investment company since the Fund is          
conducting an operating business.  Provided the Fund manages accumulated        
and annual earnings and profits, in excess of $250,000, in such a manner        
that the funds are deemed to be obligated or consumed by capital losses,        
redemptions and expansion of the operating division, the Fund will not be       
held liable for the accumulated earnings tax by the Internal Revenue            
Service.                                                                        

YEAR 2000 PROBLEM                                                               
--------------------                                                            

The fund's business operations depend on a worldwide network of computer        
systems that contain date fields, including securities trading systems,         
securities transfer agent operations and stock market links.  Many of the       
systems currently use a two digit date field to represent the date, and         
unless these systems are changed or modified, they may not be able to           
distinguish the Year 1900 from the Year 2000 (commonly referred to as the       
Year 2000 problem.  In addition, the fact that the Year 2000 is a non-          
standard leap year may create difficulties for some systems.                    

P-->485BPOS13th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
When the Year 2000 arrives, a fund's operations could be adversely affected     
if the computer systems used by the manager, its service providers and          
other third parties it does business with are not Year 2000 ready.  For         
example, the fund's portfolio and operational areas could be impacted,          
including securities trade processing, interest and dividend payments,          
securities pricing, shareholder account services, reporting, custody            
functions and others.  The fund could experience difficulties in effecting      
transactions if any of its foreign markets are not ready for Year 2000.         

The fund's manager and its affiliated service providers are making a            
conserted effort to take steps they believe are reasonably designed to          
address their Year 2000 problems.  Of course, the fund's ability to reduce      
the effects of the Year 2000 problem is also very much dependent upon the       
efforts of third parties over which the fund and its manager may have no        
control.

You may elect telephone privileges when you open your account, allowing you     
to sell your shares and make certain other changes to your account by phone.    

For accounts with more than one registered owner, telephone privileges also     
allow the fund to accept written instructions signed by only one owner for      
transactions and account changes that could otherwise be made by phone.  For    
all other transactions and changes, all registered owners must sign the

As long as we take certain measures to verify telephone requests, we will not   
be responsible for any losses that may occur from unauthorized requests.  Of

Requests to sell $10,000 or less can generally be made over the phone or with   
a simple letter.  Sometimes, however, to protect you and the fund we will       
need written instructions signed by all registered owners, with a signature     
guarantee for each owner, if:                                                   

You are selling more than $10,000 worth of shares               

    You want your proceeds paid to someone who is not a registered owner

  You want to send your proceeds somewhere other than the address of
record, or preauthorized bank or brokerage firm account         

     You have changed the address on your account by phone within the last
15 days.                                                        

We may also require a signature guarantee on instructions we receive from an    
agent, not the registered owners, or when we believe it would protect the       
fund against potential claims based on the instructions received.               

A SIGNATURE GUARANTEE HELPS PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNT AGAINST FRAUD.  YOU CAN        
OBTAIN A SIGNATURE GUARANTEE AT MOST BANKS AND SECURITIES DEALERS.  A           
NOTARY PUBLIC CANNOT PROVIDE A SIGNATURE GUARANTEE.

If you sell shares recently purchased with a check or draft, we may delay       
sending you the proceeds until your check or draft, we may delay sending        
you the proceeds until your check or draft has cleared, which may take seven    
business days or more.  A certified or cashier's check may clear in less        
time.

Your redemption check will be sent within seven business days after we receive  
your request in proper form.  We are not able to receive or pay out cash in

ACCOUNT POLICIES                                                                
CALCULATING SHARE PRICE                                                         

The fund calculates the net asset value per share (NAV) each business day at    
the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. New     
York time).  NAV is calculated by dividing net assets by the number of          
shares outstanding.                                                             

The fund's assets are generally valued at their market value.  If market        
prices are unavilable, or if an event occurs after the close of the trading     
market that materially affects the values, assets may be valued at their        
fair value.  If the fund holds securities listed primarily on a foreign         
exchange that trades on days when the fund is not open for business, the        
value of your shares may change on days that you cannot buy or sell shares.     

Requests to buy and sell shares are processed at the NAV next calculated        
after we receive your request in proper form.                                   

**WHEN YOU BUY SHARES, YOU PAY THE OFFERING PRICE.  THE OFFERING PRICE IS THE   
NAV.                                                                            
WHEN YOU SELL SHARES, YOU RECEIVE THE NAV.

as "Jt Ten" on your account statement).  To make any ownership changes to       
a joint account, all owners must agree in writing, regardless of the law        
in your state.

 At any time, the fund may change its investment minimums or waive

 You may only buy shares of the fund where it is eligible for sale
in your state or jurisdiction.                                  

    In unusual circumstances, we may temporarily suspend redemptions, or
  postpone the payment of proceeds, as allowed by federal securities
laws.                                                           

  For redemptions over a certain amount, the fund reserves the right
 to make payments in securities or other assets of the fun, in the
   case of an emergency or if the payment by check would be harmful to
existing shareholders.                                          

QUESTIONS

FUND HISTORY 

The Fund was organized as a Massachusetts corporation on February 21, 1978      
under the name of the Copley Fund, Inc.  On June 30, 1982, the Shareholders     
of the Fund approved a change of its name to the Copley Tax Managed Fund,       
Inc.  The name was changed back to the Copley Fund, Inc., effective March 11,   
1987, pursuant to approval of the Shareholders on February 4, 1987.  The        
Fund was reorganized as a New York corporation on September 1, 1987 and as      
a Florida Corporation on May 19,1994.  The Fund is a no-load, diversified,      
open-end management investment company which seeks to invest in securities      
with the potential for favorable dividend returns and capital appreciation.     

INVESTMENT GOALS AND STRATEGIES 

The primary investment goal of the Fund is to achieve accumulation of           
dividend income and long-term capital growth.  Income is sought primarily       
through investing in equity securities, primarily common stocks (including      
those listed on national securities exchanges and those traded in the           
national over-the-counter market), which are deemed to offer a possibility      
of attractive dividend returns.                                                 

Management intends that assets of the Fund will be kept fully invested,         
except for reasonable amounts held in cash to meet current expenses or for      
temporary periods pending investment.  However, when economic or market         
conditions warrant, the Fund, as a temporary defensive position, may invest     
part or all of its portfolio in investment grade bonds, securities issued       
by the U.S. Government and its agencies or instrumentalities, bankers'          
acceptances or certificates of deposit.  The Fund may invest its cash           
reserves in short-term municipal obligations, including tax, bond and revenue   
anticipation notes, construction loan and project financing notes, tax-exempt   
commercial paper and other municipal securities with maturities of less         
than 365 days.  The Fund's policy is to invest at least 75% of the value of     
its total assets in cash and cash items (including receivables), government     
securities and other securities, while not investing an amount greater than     
5% of the value of its total assets in any one issuer and not owning more       
than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer.  There is no   
assurance that the Fund's investment goals can be achieved.                     

RISKS 
The value of your shares will increase as the value of the securities owned     
by the fund increases and will decrease as the value of the fund's investments  
decrease.  In this way, you participate in any change in the value of the       
securities owned by the fund.  In addition to the factors that affect the       
value of any particular security that the fund owns, the value of fund shares   
may also change with movements in the stock and bond market as a whole.         

INTEREST RATE RISK.  To the extent the fund invests in debt securities,         
changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and     
its share price.  Rising interest rates, which often occur during times of      
inflation or a growing economy, are likely to have a negative effect on the     
value of the fund's shares.  Of course, interest rates throughout the world     
have increased and decreased, sometimes very dramatically, in the past.         
These changes are likely to occur again in the future at unpredictable times.

P-->485BPOS25th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
FOREIGN SECURITIES RISK.  The value of foreign (and U.S.) securities is         
affected by general economic conditions and individual company and industry     
earnings prospects.  While foreign securities may offer significant             
opportunities for gain, they also involve additional risks that can increase    
the potential for losses in the fund.  These risks can be significantly         
greater for investments in emerging markets.  Many of the risks described       
below also apply to investments in depository receipts.                         

The political, economic and social structures of some countries in which a      
fund invests may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S.  The   
risks of investing in these countries include the possibility of the            
imposition of exchange controls, expropriation, restrictions on removal of      
currency or other assets, nationalization of assets, and punitive taxes.        

There may be less publicly available information about a foreign company or     
government than about a U.S. company or public entity.  Certain countries'      
financial markets and services are less developed than those in the U.S. or     
other major economies.  As a result, they may not have uniform accounting,      
auditing and financial reporting standards and may have less liquidity and      
more volatility than experienced in the U.S. Transaction costs on foreign       
securities markets are generally higher than in the U.S.  The settlement        
practices may be cumbersome and result in delays that may affect portfolio      
liquidity.  The fund may have greater difficulty voting proxies, exercising     
shareholder rights, pursuing legal remedies and obtaining judgments with        
respect to foreign investments in foreign courts than with respect to           
domestic issuers in U.S. courts.                                                

Some of the countries in which the fund might invest are considered             
developing or emerging markets.  Investments in these markets are subject       
to all of the risks of foreign investing generally, and have additional and     
heightened risks due to a lack of legal, business and social frameworks to      
support securities markets.                                                     

Emerging markets involve additional significant risks, including:               

     political and social uncertainty (for example, regional conflicts and
risk of war                                                     

currency exchange rate volatility                               

pervasiveness of corruption and crime                           

delays in settling portfolio transactions                       

risk of loss arising out of the system of share registration and
custody                                                         

comparatively smaller and less liquid than developed markets    

   dependency upon foreign economic assistance and international trade

   less government supervision and regulation of business and industry
    practices, stock exchanges, brokers and listed companies than in the
U.S.

P-->485BPOS26th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
All of these factors make developing market equity and fixed-income             
securities' prices generally more volatile than securities issued in            
developed countries.                                                            

EURO RISK.  On January 1, 1999, the European Monetary Union (EMU) introduced    
a new single currency.  The euro, which will replace the national currency      
for participating member countries.  The transition and the elimination of      
currency risk among EMU countries may change the economic environment and       
behavior of investors, particularly in European markets.                        

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RISK.  The use of repurchase agreements involves certain   
risks.  For example, if the other party to the agreement defaults on its        
obligation to repurchase the underlying security at a time when the value of    
the security has declined, the fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the    
security.  If the other party to the agreement becomes insolvent and subject    
to liquidation or reorganization under the bankruptcy code or other laws, a     
court may determine that the underlying security is collateral for a loan by    
the fund not within the control of the fund, and therefore the realization      
by the fund on the collateral may be automatically stayed.  Finally, it is      
possible that the fund may not be able to substantiate its interest in the      
underlying security and may be deemed an unsecured creditor of the other        
party to the agreement.  While the manager acknowledges these risks, it is      
expected that if repurchase agreements are otherwise deemed useful to the       
fund, these risks can be controlled through careful monitoring procedures.      

UTILITIES RISK.  Historically, electric utility companies were required by      
state regulators to build and maintain generation plants, transmission and      
distribution lines, and other equipment.  State regulators set the rates        
that the companies could charge customers to pay for these costs, spread        
over as much as 30 years.  As the various states move away from the             
traditional regulatory model toward greater competitiveness among electric      
utilities, customers will be able to choose different electricity suppliers     
and will no longer pay for the equipment and facilities that were mandated      
by regulators, thus creating "stranded costs" for their former electricity      
suppliers.  If states fail to enact legislation that permits electricity        
suppliers to recover their stranded costs, the financial position of these      
suppliers could be adversely affected, which could cause the value of the       
fund's holdings in such companies and its net asset value to fall.              

TAX RISK.  Because the Fund accumulates rather than distributes its income,     
the Fund may be subject to the imposition of the Federal accumulated earnings   
tax (the "AET")(See "Taxation of the Fund" at page 6.  The AET is imposed on    
a corporation's accumulated taxable income (the "ATI") for each taxable year    
at the rate of 39.6%.  ATI is defined as the adjusted taxable income of         
the Fund minus the sum of the dividends paid deduction and the accumulated      
earnings credit (as discussed below).  The dividends paid deduction and the     
accumulated earnings credit is available only if the Fund is not held to be     
a "mere holding or investment company."                                         

In the early part of 1987, the Fund commenced activities in the luggage and     
related products trade business.  The business is being operated as a           
division of the Fund, with the value of business assets and the earnings        
attributable thereto being included in the net assets of the Fund for all       
purposes.  The assets of the operating division should not result in the Fund   

5               

P-->485BPOS27th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
ceasing to be an open-end investment company under the Act.  Management         
believes, although there can be no assurance, that under existing law the       
Fund's operation of its active trade or business should be sufficient to        
enable the Fund to not be classified as a "mere holding or investment           
company" for purpose of the AET.  Under that proposition, the Fund is           
entitled to a dividends paid deduction from ATI for that portion of Fund        
redemptions representing the amount of undistributed earnings accumulated       
since the inception of the fund and through the date of redemption allocable    
to the redeemed shares.                                                         

The Internal Revenue Service has recently upheld management's position that     
the Fund is not a mere holding or investment company since the Fund is          
conducting an operating business.  Provided the fund manages accumulated and    
annual earnings and profits, in excess of $250,000, in such a manner that       
the funds are deemed to be obligated or consumed by capital losses,             
redemptions and expansion of the operating division, the Fund will not be       
held liable for the accumulated earnings tax by the internal Revenue Service.   

In the event an accumulated earnings tax would be assessed against the fund,    
such assessment would decrease the net assets of the fund and have a            
proportionate negative affect on each shareholder's account.                    

TAXATION OF THE FUND 

Unlike most all other mutual funds, the Fund is taxed as a regular              
corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").   
Except to the extent hereinafter discussed the Fund retains all net             
investment income and realized capital gains, if any, to increase the Fund's    
assets.  Consequently, shareholders are not individually liable for income      
taxes associated with the operations of the Fund except upon sale of shares     
or the receipt of distributions.                                                

The Fund is taxed, for Federal income tax purposes, on a schedule of rates      
ranging from 15% to 34% depending upon its taxable income.  However, a 5%       
additional tax rate applies to phase out the benefits of the graduated rates    
if the Fund's taxable income is between $100,000 and $335,000.  Subject to      
specific limitations, the Fund is entitled to a deduction in computing its      
Federal taxable income equal to 70% of the amount of dividends received by      
the Fund from domestic corporations.  This dividends received deduction may     
not exceed 70% of the fund's taxable income unless the Fund has a net           
operating loss for a taxable year, as computed after deducting the dividend     
received deduction.  It is anticipated, although there can be no assurance,     
that the Fund's management fees and other expenses may offset a substantial     
portion of the remaining 30% of the dividend income and investment income       
from other sources during each taxable year.                                    

The fund pays income taxes on any net realized capital gain at the statutory    
rate noted above.  In addition, the Fund will, for financial statement          
purposes, accrue deferred income taxes on net unrealized capital gains that     
are expected to be realized at the fund level.  The fund may carry net          
capital losses forward for five years as an offset against any net capital      
gains realized by the fund during the current year.

P-->485BPOS28th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
Legislative or regulatory changes in, or interpretations of, applicable         
federal tax laws, regulations or rulings may make it impossible for the fund    
to utilize certain of the tax management techniques and strategies described    
in the prospectus.  The fund intends to evaluate continuously the operations    
of the fund under current federal tax laws as well as various alternatives      
available.                                                                      

OPERATING DIVISION                                                              

In an effort to enhance its performance and the profitability of an             
investment therein and to preserve and promote its primary investment           
objective in the context of the federal tax laws the fund has engaged, on a     
limited basis, in the luggage and related products business.  To facilitate     
the conduct of such an "operating business," the fund's shareholders, on        
February 4, 1987, approved changes in fundamental policy which expand the       
fund's ability to borrow money and make loans with respect to an active         
trade or business.  The fund can now borrow up to one-third of the value of     
its total net assets and extend credit to, or act as surety for, other          
persons or entities in connection with the conduct of any active trade or       
business, so long as the total exposure of the fund represented by such         
extensions of credit or suretyship arrangements, when added to the aggregate    
borrowings of the fund, does not exceed 10% of the value of the fund's total    
net assets.  The shareholders also approved a fundamental policy designed       
to maintain the status of the fund as a diversified investment company by       
limiting the value of any trade or business to 24% or less of the fund's        
total assets and limiting the gross profit therefrom to 10% or less of the      
fund's total annual gross income.  Investors should note that the fundamental   
policy changes do not restrict the types of active trades or businesses         
into which the fund can enter.                                                  

The revised borrowings policy allows the fund to arrange credit for the         
effective conduct of the operating business, including the placement of         
orders for foreign manufactured products collateralized by letters of credit    
or similar documentary drafts.  The fund's ability to extend credit to, or      
act as surety for, others affords the fund the opportunity to joint venture     
or otherwise participate in significant importing opportunities with other      
importers.  Shareholders should be aware that joint ventures and                
participations, should they arise, will have risks inherent in them which may   
be different in character from normal business risks, such as casualty,         
breach of purchase contracts, warranty claims, and similar occurrences,         
associated with any active trade or business engaged in the purchase, sale,     
delivery and redelivery of goods.  Thus, for example, joint ventures or         
participations will carry with them the risks of non-performance or             
inadequacy of the resources of joint venturer or participant.  In addition,a    
joint venturer or participant, in all likelihood, will not be familiar          
with regulatory aspects of the fund's business or its fundamental policies,     
thereby requiring the fund to police carefully the activities of other          
ventures or participants to assure that activities or commitments binding       
upon the fund are not undertaken by another venturer which interfere with the   
attainment of the fund's primary investment objective or which contravene the   
fund's fundamental policies or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended   
(the "Act").  (References to the Act herein should not be interpreted or        
construed as indicating that the Securities and Exchange Commission has         
determined that the fund's Management has acted in compliance with the          
provisions thereof or has, in any way supervised the fund's Management or       
its investment practices or policies.)  In light of the fund

P-->485BPOS29th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
President's 40 years of experience in the luggage and related products          
business, including the importation of such goods, Management believes that the 
fund will be successful in formulating policies and guidelines                  
governing the undertaking of any such ventures or participations which will     
ameliorate, if not eliminate, the additional risks to a degree sufficient to    
allow the Fund to undertake appropriate joint ventures or participations        
with confidence that the risks inherent therein will be normal and customary    
and consistent with the fund's fundamental policies, the Act and the            
continued achievement of the fund's primary investment objectives.  If a        
joint venture is structured as a partnership, the fund will not serve as a      
general partner and, in serving as a limited partner, will not assume           
liability which, in Management's view, is unreasonable in light of the scope    
of the fund's partnership interest.  In addition to the risks outlined above,   
the Fund's operating business, to the extent that it entails the importation    
of foreign products, may be affected by unfavorable monetary exchange rates     
making foreign imports less competitive with domestic products and thus less    
attractive to American consumers.                                               

Without the fund's entry into an operating business, Management believes that   
the fund may have been forced to make taxable distributions to its              
Shareholders in contravention of its investment objectives in order to avoid    
or limit its potential accumulated earnings tax liability.  While there can     
be no assurance that the conduct of the operating business will either          
eliminate or minimize the risk that the fund will be subject to the             
accumulated earnings tax, management believes that the operating business       
will prove lucrative to the fund.                                               

FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES 

Copley Fund has adopted the following restrictions as fundamental policies.     
This means that they may only be changed if approved by (i) more than 50%       
of the fund's outstanding shares or (ii) 67% or more of the fund's shares       
present at a shareholder meeting if more than 50% of the fund's shares are      
represented at the meeting in person or by proxy, whichever is less.            

(1)  Issue any senior securities;                               

   (2)  Except for (a) temporary, extraordinary or emergency purposes,
or (b) in connection with the conduct of any active trade or business at        
any time conducted by the Fund consistent with Fundamental Policy 13 of the     
Fund, borrow money, and then only from banks (for purposes of the foregoing     
clause (b), including but not necessarily limited to the establishment and      
maintenance of credit facilities, e.g., letters of credit, documentary          
drafts, or demands for payment) and in amounts not in excess of 33 1/3% of      
the value of its total net assets taken at the lower of cost or market.  If,    
due to market fluctuations or other reasons, the value of the Fund's assets     
falls below 300% of its borrowings, the Fund, within three (3) days (not        
including Sundays or holidays) will reduce its borrowings to the extent         
that its asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least 300%.  This        
borrowing provision is not for investment leverage per se but solely to         
facilitate orderly operation of any active trade or business of the Fund at     
any time being operated consistent with Fundamental Policy 13 and to            
facilitate management of the portfolio by enabling the Fund to meet             
redemption requests at times when the liquidation of portfolio securities       
is inconvenient or disadvantageous;                                             

8               

P-->485BPOS30th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
 (3)  Act as underwriter, except to the extent that, in connection
with the disposition of portfolio securities, the Fund may be deemed to be      
an underwriter under certain Federal securities laws;                           

   (4)  Concentrate its investment in any particular industry, but, if
deemed consistent with the Fund's investment objectives, up to 25% of its       
assets may be invested in any one industry.  However, for temporary defensive   
purposes, the Fund may at times invest more than 25% of the value of its        
assets in cash or cash items (including bank demand deposits); securities       
issued or guaranteed by the United States government, its agencies or           
instrumentality's, or instruments secured by money market instruments;          

(5)  Engage in the purchase or sale of interests in real estate;

  (6)  Purchase or sell commodities or commodities future contracts;

 (7)  Make loans to other persons; provided, however, that (i) the
purchase of a portion of an issue of publicly distributed bonds or debentures   
and money market instruments (within the limits described in Fundamental        
Policy 4) will not be considered the making of a loan; and (ii) the Fund, in    
connection with any trade or business of the Fund at any time conducted         
consistent with Fundamental Policy 13, may extend credit to, or act as surety   
for, any other person, so long as the total exposure of the Fund represented    
by such extensions of credit or suretyship arrangements, when added to the      
aggregate borrowings of the Fund, does not at any one time exceed 10% of the    
value of the Fund's total net assets; and provided further that in applying     
Fundamental Policy 2, the Fund shall treat any extensions of credit or          
suretyship arrangements at the time outstanding as a borrowing subject to the   
limitations of Fundamental Policy 2.                                            

   (8)  Investment in securities of other investment companies, except
in connection with a merger, consolidation, combination or similar              
transaction with another investment company;                                    

   (9)   Make investments on margin, except such short-term credits as
are necessary for the clearance of transactions;                                

(10)   Make short sales of securities;                          

(11)   Make investments for the purpose of exercising control of

     (12)  Purchase or retain, longer than reasonably necessary for proper
disposal thereof, any securities of an issuer if the officers and directors     
of the Fund or its adviser, own individually more than one percent of the       
securities of such issuer, or together own more than five percent of the

      (13)  Engage in one or more active trades or businesses, if the assets
of the Fund constituting such trades or businesses, exceed, in the aggregate,   
24% of the value of the Fund's total assets, or during any taxable year of      
the Fund, the gross income of the Fund attributable to such active trades or    
businesses represents, in the aggregate, more than 10% of the gross profit      
(gross revenues less cost of goods sold) of the Fund for Federal income tax

purposes; provided, however, that if due to market fluctuations or other        
reasons, the value of the Fund's assets constituting such active trades or      
businesses exceeds 24% of the value of the Fund's total assets or the gross     
income of the Fund for any tax year attributable to such active trades or       
businesses is reasonably expected to exceed 10% of the gross profit of the      
Fund for such tax year, the Fund will take steps to divest itself of, or        
otherwise curtail such active trades or businesses, to cause the same to        
comply with the foregoing percentages.

 INVESTMENT ADVISER
THE ADVISER                                                                     

Copley Financial Services Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation ("CFSC"),    
315 Pleasant St., Fall River, Massachusetts 02721, serves as Investment        
Adviser to the Fund, pursuant to an Investment Advisory Contract dated          
September 1, 1978.                                                              

CFSC is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,       
and it was incorporated in February, 1978.  CFSC presently has no investment    
advisory clients other than the Fund; however, CFSC may act as an investment    
adviser to other mutual funds in the future.  CFSC is controlled by Irving      
Levine who is President, Treasurer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of    
CFSC, as well as its one hundred percent (100%) stockholder.  Mr. Levine also   
controls the Fund and serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and      
President.  This dual capacity could lead to conflicts of interest between      
Mr. Levine and the Fund or CFSC, as the case may be.  It should be understood   

12            

P-->485BPOS34th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
that CFSC's resources are limited, and, at the present time, Mr. Levine is      
its only employee.  All final investment decisions are made by Mr. Levine.      

The directors and principal executive officers of Copley Financial Services     
Corporation, in addition to Mr. Levine, are:  Cliff Drysdale, Director;         
Jeffrey J. Steiner, Director; and Stephen L. Brown, Director.                   

ADVISORY SERVICES AND FEES 

Under the Investment Advisory Contract between the Fund and CFSC, CFSC          
provides the Fund with investment advice, research and statistical and other    
factual information and manages and supervises the Fund's portfolio of          
investments.  In performing these functions, CFSC (i) uses its best efforts     
to present a continuing and suitable investment program which is consistent     
with the investment objectives of the Fund; (ii) furnishes the Fund with        
information and reports regarding the securities in the portfolio and           
proposed additions to the portfolio; (iii) supervises the Fund's relationship   
with its Custodian, Transfer Agent, auditors, lawyers and any governmental      
agencies having jurisdiction over the Fund; and (iv) furnishes the Fund with    
certain office space and secretarial and clerical assistance as may be          
necessary to perform the forgoing functions.  CFSC has no responsibility for    
advising the Fund as to the conduct of the operating business, that function    
being the sole and exclusive province of the Board of Directors.                

CFSC receives an annual investment advisory fee for its services rendered       
to the Fund.  The fee is based upon a percentage of the Fund's daily net        
assets computed without regard to the assets of the operating business (the     
assets upon which the fee is computed being hereinafter referred to as the      
"net securities assets") and is calculated daily and paid monthly as follows:   

   (1)  1.00% of the first $25,000,000 of average daily net securities
assets;                                               

  (2)  0.75% of the next $15,000,000 of average daily net securities
assets; and                                           

  (3)  0.50% of the average daily net securities assets in excess of
$40,000,000.                                          

In the past CFSC has voluntarily waived up to one-half of the investment        
advisory fee charged to the Fund.  CFSC is under no obligation to waive any     
part of its fee, and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the        
future.  However, shareholders will be given thirty days written notice         
prior to cessation of such practice.                                            

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Contract, the investment advisory fees      
earned by CFSC during the Fund's fiscal years ending February 29, 1997,         
February 28, 1998, and February 28, 1999 were $531,290, $544,084, and _______

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 

The manager selects brokers and dealers to execute the funds' portfolio         
transactions in accordance with criteria set forth in the management            
agreement and any directions that the board may give.                           

When placing a portfolio transaction, the manager seeks to obtain prompt        
execution of orders at the most favorable net price.  For portfolio             
transactions on a securities exchange, the amount of commission paid is         
negotiated between the manager and the broker executing the transaction.        
The determination and evaluation of the reasonableness of the brokerage         
commissions paid are based to a large degree on the professional opinions of    
the persons responsible for placement and review of the transactions.  These    
opinions are based on the experience of these individuals in the securities     
industry and information available to them about the level of commissions       
being paid by other institutional investors of comparable size.  The manager    
will ordinarily place orders to buy and sell over-the-counter securities on     
a principal rather than agency basis with a principal market maker unless,      
in the opinion of the manager, a better price and execution can otherwise be    
obtained.  Purchases of portfolio securities from underwriters will include     
a commission or concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter, and           
purchases from dealers will include a spread between the bid and ask price.     

The manager may pay certain brokers commissions that are higher than those      
another broker may charge, if the manager determines in good faith that the     
amount paid is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and         
research services it receives.  This may be viewed in terms of either the       
particular transaction or the manager's overall responsibilities.  The          
services that brokers may provide to the manager include, among others,         
supplying information about particular companies, markets, countries, or        
local, regional, national or transnational economies, statistical data,         
quotations and other securities pricing information, and other information      
that provides lawful and appropriate assistance to the manager in carrying      
out its investment advisory responsibilities.  These services may not always    
directly benefit the fund.  They must, however, be of value to the manager      
in carrying out its overall responsibilities.                                   

Since most purchases by U.S. Government Securities Series are principal         
transactions at net prices, U.S. Government Securities Series incurs little     
or no brokerage costs.  The fund deals directly with the selling or buying      
principal or market maker without incurring charges for the services of a       
broker on its behalf, unless it is determined that a better price or            
execution may be obtained by using the services of a broker.  Purchases of      
portfolio securities from underwriters will include a commission or             
concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter, and purchases from dealers    
will include a spread between the bid and ask prices.  The fund seeks to        
obtain prompt execution of orders at the most favorable net price.              
Transactions may be directed to dealers in return for research and              
statistical information, as well as for special services provided by the        
dealers in the execution of orders.                                             

It is not possible to place a dollar value on the special executions or on      
the research services the manager receives from dealers effecting               
transactions in portfolio securities.  The allocation of transactions in        
order to obtain additional research services allows the manager to supplement   
its own research

and analysis activities and to receive the views and information of             
individuals and research staffs of other securities firms.  If the funds'       
officers are satisfied that the best execution is obtained, the sale of         
fund shares may also be considered a factor in the selection of                 
broker-dealers to execute the fund's portfolio transactions.                    

CAPITAL STOCK 

The fund has 5,000,000 authorized common shares (par value $1.00 per share).    
These shares, upon issuance, are fully paid and nonassessable, are entitled     
to one vote per share and a fractional vote equal to the fractional share       
held, are freely transferable and, in liquidation of the Fund, are entitled     
to receive the net assets of the fund.  Shareholders have no preemptive,        
conversion or cumulative voting rights.  On June 29, 1983, the Shareholders     
approved a 1 for 3 reverse stock split for all shares outstanding at the        
close of business on such day.                                                  

CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 

The financial statements included in the Prospectus and this Statement of       
Additional Information have been audited for the fiscal year ended February
28, 1992 through 1999 by Roy G. Hale, Certified Public Accountant. The          
financial statements included in the Prospectus and Statement of Additional     
Information for the fiscal years ended February 28, 1988, 1989 and 1990 were    
audited by Spicer & Oppenheim, certified public accountants.  Financial         
Statements for 1991 were audited by Grant Thornton (formerly Spicer &           
Oppenheim).  The principal business address of Roy G. Hale is 624 Clarks Run    
Road, LaPlata, MD 20646.                                                        

PRICING, PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES                                      
PRICING SHARES                                                                  

When you buy shares, you pay the offering price.  The offering price is the     
net asset value (NAV) per share, calculated to two decimal places using         
standard rounding criteria.  When you sell shares, you receive the NAV.         

The value of a mutual fund is determined by deducting the fund's liabilities    
from the total assets of the portfolio.  The net asset value per share is       
determined by dividing the net asset value of the fund by the number of         
shares outstanding.                                                             

15              

P-->485BPOS37th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
The funds calculate the NAV per share of each class each business day at        
the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 P.M.         
eastern time).  The fund does not calculate the NAV on days the New York        
Stock Exchange (NYSE) is closed for trading, which include New Year's Day,      
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,         
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.                

When determining its NAV, the fund values cash and receivables at their         
realizable amounts, and records interest as accrued and dividends on the        
ex-dividend date.  If market quotations are readily available for portfolio     
securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market     
System, the fund values those securities at the last quoted sale price of       
the day or, if there is no reported sale, within the range of the most recent   
quoted bid and ask prices.  The fund values over-the-counter portfolio          
securities within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices.       
If portfolio securities trade both in the over-the-counter market and on a      
stock exchange, the fund values them according to the broadest and most         
representative market as determined by the manager.                             

Other securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued   
at the current market price, which may be obtained from a pricing service,      
based on a variety of factors including recent trades, institutional size       
trading in similar types of securities (considering yield, risk and maturity)   
and/or developments related to specific issues.                                 

PURCHASE                                                                        

Shares are continuously offered at current net asset value without payment of   
any sales charge or commission.  Investors who purchase and redeem Fund         
shares through broker-dealers, banks and other institutions may be subject to   
fees imposed by those entities with respect to the services they provide.       

To make an initial investment, a prospective investor should complete the       
investment application which appears at the end of the prospectus and forward   
it with a check for $1,000 or more, made payable to Copley Fund, Inc., c/o      
Steadman Security Corp., 1730 K Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20006.  If the    
application is accepted, a confirmation indicating details of the transaction   
will be sent to the purchaser directly.  If the application is rejected, the    
investor's check will be returned to him promptly.  Investment checks are       
invested at the net asset value next determined after their receipt by the      
Fund.                                                                           

The minimum initial investment of $1,000 will be waived when a group of         
employees in cooperation with its employer and the fund purchases shares        
through a payroll deduction or other group purchase plan.  Once an account      
(individual or group) has been established, additional investments of $100 or   
more may be made at any time.  These minimum amounts also may be waived for     
persons investing under the Fund's Keogh Plan or through the medium of an       
Individual Retirement Account ("IRA").                                          

AS A CONDITION OF THIS OFFERING, IF A PURCHASE IS CANCELED DUE TO NONPAYMENT    
OR BECAUSE A CHECK DOES NOT CLEAR, THE PURCHASER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY    
LOSS THE FUND INCURS.  If you are already a Shareholder, the fund

reserves the right to redeem shares from your account(s) to reimburse the       
fund for any such loss arising from an attempt to purchase additional shares.   

STOCK CERTIFICATES:  The Transfer Agent will not issue stock certificates       
for your shares unless requested.  In order to facilitate redemptions and       
transfers, most Shareholders elect not to receive certificates.  The stock      
certificates are issued at no charge to the purchaser, but if a certificate     
is lost, the purchaser may incur an expense to replace it.                      

CONFIRMATIONS:  Upon receipt and acceptance by the Fund of an application for   
purchase of shares, the shares will be registered as designated by the          
purchaser in an open account.  Purchases will be credited to the account in     
full and fractional shares, and a confirmation of each purchase will be sent    
to the Shareholder indicating the amount of the most recent purchase, the       
number of new shares acquired and the total number of shares left in the        
account.  The confirmation is adequate evidence of the ownership of shares,     
and redemptions and transfers of ownership may be accomplished without the      
use of share certificates.                                                      

REDEMPTION                                                                      

An investor may redeem his shares by sending a written request for redemption   
signed by the investor and any co-owners.  The request should be sent to        
Copley Fund, Inc., c/o Steadman Security Corp., 1730 K St., N.W., Washington,   
DC 20006, and must include the name of the Fund and the investor's account     
number.  ANY CERTIFICATES INVOLVED IN THE REDEMPTION MUST BE SURRENDERED WITH   
THE REQUEST, ENDORSED WITH SIGNATURE(S) GUARANTEED BY A TRUST COMPANY OR A      
COMMERCIAL BANK THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM OR A MEMBER      
FIRM OF A DOMESTIC STOCK EXCHANGE OR A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF    
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. OR BY A SAVINGS BANK OR A SAVINGS AND LOAN             
ASSOCIATION OR CREDIT UNION.  NOTARIZATIONS BY A NOTARY PUBLIC ARE NOT          
ACCEPTABLE, REQUESTS FOR REDEMPTION OF $1,000 OR MORE FROM ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH   
NO CERTIFICATES HAVE BEEN ISSUED, OR REDEMPTIONS BY PERSONS ACTING IN A         
REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, FOR EXAMPLE, CORPORATE OFFICERS, TRUSTEES, CUSTODIANS, 
ETC., ALSO MUST INCLUDE SIGNATURE GUARANTEES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  PERSONS      
ACTING IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, FOR EXAMPLE, CORPORATE OFFICERS,           
TRUSTEES, CUSTODIANS, ETC., MUST ALSO PRESENT, WITH THEIR REDEMPTION REQUESTS,  
EVIDENCE OF APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORITY TO ACT, IN FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE       
TRANSFER AGENT.  REQUESTS FOR REDEMPTIONS TO THIRD PARTY PAYEE(S) MUST BE       
SIGNATURE GUARANTEED REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE REDEMPTION REQUEST.  Where   
signature guarantees are necessary, the redemption will not be effective until  
the proper guarantees are received, and the current net asset value applicable  
to the redemption will be that next computed after their receipt.               

Within three business days after receipt of a properly executed request for     
redemption of properly endorsed share certificate, the fund will redeem the     
shares at a price equal to the net asset value next computed after the          
receipt of the request.  Such current net asset value may be more or less       
than the investor's cost.                                                       

The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed       
during periods; (i) when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than on   
weekends and holidays; (ii) when an emergency exists, as determined by the      
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as a result of which           
disposal

by the fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable, or it is   
not reasonably practicable for the fund fairly to determine the value of its    
current net assets; (iii) when, under conditions set forth in the rules and     
regulations or pursuant to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted or suspended; and (iv)     
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit or require for    
the protection of investors.  In case of a suspension of the right of           
redemption, a Shareholder who has tendered a certificate for redemption or,     
if no certificate has been issued, has tendered a written request for           
redemption, may withdraw his request for redemption of his certificate from     
deposit.  In the absence of such a withdrawal, he will receive payment of the   
current net asset value next determined after the suspension has been           
terminated.                                                                     

The fund has the right, exercisable at the discretion of the Board of           
Directors and at any time after thirty (30) days written notice, to redeem      
shares of any Shareholder for their then current net asset value per share if   
at such time the Shareholder owns shares having an aggregate net asset value    
of less than $500, provided that such reduction in net asset value below $500   
is the result of withdrawals and not market fluctuations.                       

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM                                                   

Each Shareholder owning shares with an aggregate value of $10,000 or more       
shall have the right to redeem a portion of his shares in equal dollar          
amounts on a monthly basis.  Such right may be exercised by delivery of a       
written election to so redeem to the Transfer Agent, accompanied by a           
surrender of all share certificates then outstanding in the name of such        
Shareholder, properly endorsed by him.  This plan may, and probably will,       
involve the use of principal and, depending on the amount withdrawn, the        
investor's principal may eventually be depleted.  No additional charge to the   
Shareholder is made for this service.  A sufficient number of shares will be    
liquidated at intervals (i.e., monthly or quarterly) at the then current net    
asset value attributable to such shares of the date of liquidation to meet      
withdrawals specified.  Systematic withdrawals are processed on the             
twenty-fifth day of the month.                                                  

For tax purposes, withdrawal payments may not be considered as yield or income, 
and investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax     
treatment of withdrawals.                                                       

An investor may terminate the plan at any time by delivering written notice     
to the Transfer Agent.  If all shares held by the investor are liquidated at    
any time, the plan will terminate automatically.  The fund or its investment    
advisor may terminate the plan at any time after reasonable notice to the       
investor.                                                                       

Investors making the requisite $10,000 investment in shares who wish to elect   
redemption under the Systematic Withdrawal Program should complete the          
Systematic Withdrawal Application at the end of the prospectus and forward it   
to Copley Fund, Inc., c/o Steadman Security Corp., 1730 K St., N.W.,            
Washington, DC 20006.

It is possible that conditions may exist in the future which would, in the      
opinion of the Board of Directors, make it undesirable for the fund to pay      
for redemptions in cash.  In such cases the Board may authorize payment to be   
made in portfolio securities of the fund.  However, the fund is obligated       
under the 1940 Act to redeem for cash all shares presented for redemption by    
any one shareholder up to $250,000 ( or 1% of the fund's net assets if that     
is less) in any 90 day period.  Securities delivered in payment of              
redemptions are valued at the same value assigned them in computing the net     
asset value per share.  Shareholder receiving such securities generally will    
incur brokerage costs on their sales.                                           

PERFORMANCE 

Performance quotations are subject to SEC rules.  These rules require the use   
of standardized performance quotations or, alternatively, that every            
non-standardized performance quotation furnished by a fund be accompanied by    
certain standardized performance information computed as required by the SEC.   
Average annual total return and current yield quotations used by the funds      
are based on the standardized methods of computing performance mandated by      
the SEC.  If a Rule 12b-1 plan is adopted, performance figures reflect fees     
from the date of the plan's implementation.  An explanation of these and        
other methods used by the funds to compute or express performance follows.      
Regardless of the method used, past performance does not guarantee future       
results, and is an indication of the return to shareholders only for the        
limited historical period used.                                                 

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN                                                     

Average annual total return is determined by finding the average annual rates   
of return over the periods indicated below that would equate an initial         
hypothetical $10,000 investment to its ending redeemable value.                 
The calculation assumes the maximum initial sales charge is deducted from the   
initial $10,000 purchase, and income dividends and capital gain distributions   
are reinvested at net asset value.  The quotation assumes the account was       
completely redeemed at the end of each period and the deduction of all          
applicable charges and fees.  If a change is made to the sales charge           
structure, historical performance information will be restated to reflect the   
maximum initial sales charge currently in effect.                               

When considering the average annual total return quotations, you should keep    
in mind that the maximum initial sales charge reflected in each quotation is    
a one time fee charged on all direct purchases, which will have its greatest    
impact during the early stages of your investment.  This charge will affect     
actual performance less the longer you retain your investment in the fund.      
The average annual total returns for the indicated periods ended February 28,
1999, were:

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN                                                         

Like average annual total return, cumulative total return assumes the maximum   
initial sales charge is deducted from the initial $1,000 purchase, and income   
dividends and capital gain distributions are reinvested at net asset value.     
Cumulative total return, however, is based on the actual return for a           
specified period rather than on the average return over the periods indicated   
above.  The cumulative total returns for the indicated periods ended February
28, 1999, were:

Current yield shows the income per share earned by a fund.  It is calculated    
by dividing the net investment income per share earned during a 30-day base     
period by the applicable maximum offering price per share on the last day of    
the period and annualizing the result.  Expenses accrued for the period         
include any fees charged to all shareholders of the class during the base       
period.  The yields for the 30-day period ended February 28, 1999, were:

Occasionally statistics may be used to show a fund's volatility or risk.        
Measures of volatility or risk are generally used to compare a fund's net       
asset value or performance to a market index.  One measure of volatility is     
beta.  Beta is the volatility of a fund relative to the total market, as        
represented by an index considered representative of the types of securities    
in which the fund invests.  A beta of more than 1.00 indicates volatility       
greater than the market and a beta of less than 1.00 indicates volatility       
less than the market. Another measure of volatility or risk is standard         
deviation.  Standard deviation is used to measure variability of net asset      
value or total return around an average over a specified period of time.  The   
idea is that greater volatility means greater risk undertaken in achieving      
performance.                                                                    

COMPARISONS                                                                     

To help you better evaluate how an investment in the fund may satisfy your      
investment goal, advertisements and other materials about the funds may         
discuss certain measures of fund performance as reported by various financial   
publications.  Materials may also compare performance (as calculated above)     
to performance as reported by other investments, indices, and averages.         
These comparisons may include, but are not limited to, the following examples:  

Dow Jones( Composite Average and its component averages - a price-weighted      
average of 65 stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  The average

Average (20 transportation stocks), and the Dow Jones Utilities Average         
(15 utility stocks involved in the production of electrical energy).            

Standard & Poor's( Stock Index or its component indices - a capitalization-     
weighted index designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy    
through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all

Item 27.        Indeminification                                                

   The Articles of Organization of the Fund provide that each director
and officer shall be indemnified by the Fund against liabilities, fines,        
penalties and claims imposed upon or asserted against him (including amounts    
paid in settlement) by reason of having been such a director or officer,        
whether or not then continuing so to be, and against all expenses (including    
counsel fees) reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, except in     
relation to matters as to which he shall have been finally adjudicated in       
any proceeding guilty of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or    
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.  In     
the absence of such an adjudication in any such proceeding or in the absence    
of a settlement thereof, no indemnification shall be permitted unless there     
is first obtained a determination by independent legal counsel to the effect    
that, based upon a review of the facts, the officer or director seeking         
indemnification is not guilty of willful misfeasance, bad faith,                
gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the            
conduct of his office.  "Independent legal counsel" shall not include           
counsel for the Fund, its investment adviser, its principal underwriter,        
if any, or persons affiliated with the Fund or such adviser or underwriter.     
"Director" or "officer" includes every director or officer or former            
director or officer of the Fund and every person who may have served at         
its request as a director or officer or other official serving in an            

P-->485BPOS48th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
equivalent capacity for another corporation or unincorporated business entity   
in which the Fund owns shares of stock or has an equity interest or of which    
it is a creditor or, in the case of non-stock corporation, to which the Fund    
contributes.  Such terms also include personal representatives.  The            
indemnity rights granted by the Fund's Articles of Organization are not         
deemed to be exclusive of other rights, if any, which such a director or        
officer may have under applicable law.                                          

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the    
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), may be permitted to directors,  
officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing    
provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion   
of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against       
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In     
the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other      
than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a            
director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful    
defense of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,   
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being           
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the       
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to the court of        
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is     
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the       
final adjudication of such issue.

Dear Fellow Shareholder:
  This past quarter and, in fact, these past nine months have placed us in the top echelon of the Growth and Income category (as defined by most performance measurement groups).  We do not profess to be in competition with other funds as our structure is geared to after-tax returns not pre-tax returns to shareholders.  Keep in mind that Copley does not distribute dividends on capital gains but pays its own taxes.  Our studies have shown that a mean comparative average of performance between Copley and other funds is approximately three percent, i.e., if a fund has gained 13% and Copley 10% the two funds are probably equal in after-tax return for the individual ex tax free accounts.
  Our investment philosophy of owning stocks with high dividends and histories of increases in dividends has enabled us in this volatile environment to continue to show net increases in net asset value.  This past quarter we showed a gain of 1% while most averages and funds lost 15% to 20%.  This result has been noted by many financial publications.
  We believe this erosion of value will in the long run create a stronger stock market environment.  It will eliminate the weak of heart investors.  It will lower expectations of unreasonable growth and will create a healthier climate of sane investing.
  However, we still must weather the problems of Asia, Russia, South America and the exposure of banks to their losses in hedge funds and loans to the above area. If banks do not have the liquidity to lend to business, small business must suffer and in many cases go into bankruptcy as occurred in the real estate debacle of 1988 when banks no longer had liquidity to lend money and good small businesses were forced to fail.  This could cause a significant though temporary downturn domino effect to the economy.
  Meanwhile Copley continues its steady growth as evidenced by our long term record.

  Our operating division has added shoes for our distribution.  This has increased our volume for the six months to more than $1,000,000.00 with a concurrent increase in profits added to our net asset value.
  We do look forward to continued steady increases even in this volatile market environment and wish to express our appreciation to our Board of Directors for their help and advice and to our shareholders for their confidence and understanding of Copley's concept and structure.

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Copley Fund, Inc.

�
	I have made a review of the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the portfolio of investments, of Copley Fund, Inc., as of August 31, 1998, and the related statement of operations, the statement of cash flows, the statement of changes in net assets, and the selected per share data and ratios for the six months then ended, in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  All information included in these statements is the representation of the management of Copley Fund, Inc.
 
	A review of interim financial information consists principally of obtaining an understanding of the system for the preparation of interim financial information, applying analytical review procedures to financial data, and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, I do not express such an opinion.
	Based upon my review, I am not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
	I have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the statement of assets and liabilities as of February 28, 1998 and the related financial statements and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented in full herein); and in my report of April 22, 1998, I expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1. Significant Accounting Policies
  The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, open-end management company. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
  Security Valuation
  Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the period; securities traded on the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and asked prices.
  Sales of Securities
  In determining the net realized gain or loss from sales of securities, the cost of securities sold is determined on the basis of identifying the specific certificates delivered.
  Equalization
  The Fund follows the accounting practice known as equalization by
which a portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of repurchases of
capital shares, equivalent on a per-share basis to the amount of
distributable net investment and operating income on the date of the
transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment and
operating income.
  Distributions
  It is the Fund's policy to manage its assets so as to avoid the
necessity of making annual taxable distributions. Net investment and
operating income and net realized gains are not distributed, but rather are accumulated within the Fund and added to the value of the Fund shares.
  Inventory
  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first in/first out method) or market.
  Income Taxes
  The Fund files tax returns as a regular corporation and accordingly the financial statements include provisions for current and deferred income taxes.
  Other
  Security transactions are accounted for on the date the securities are purchased or sold. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded as earned.

2. Federal and State Income Taxes
  The income tax provision included in the

  financial statements is as follows:


  Regular federal tax liability. . . . . $ 63,417
  State tax liability. . . . . . . . . .  9,058
  Deferred taxes . . . . . . . . . . . .   20,025


		  $ 92,500
  	  	  ========
�
  The Fund provides deferred taxes for unrealized appreciation on its investment portfolio to the extent that management anticipates that a liability may exist. The amount of deferred taxes currently available to the Fund is $1,900,096, consisting of $298,513 accumulated general liability and a cumulative alternative minimum tax carryover of $1,601,583. The difference between the effective rate on investment and operating income and the expected statutory rate is due substantially to the use by the Fund of the dividends received deduction.
The Fund has $2,342,184 in accumulated capital loss carryforwards which expires as follows: $655,665 on February 29, 2000, $245,639 on February 28, 2002 and $1,440,880 on February 28, 2003.
For fiscal years ending prior to February 28, 1998, the Fund was subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax due to differences in recognition of income for book and tax purposes.  However, for the current fiscal year the Fund will not be subject to the alternative minimum tax since it qualifies under the provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 which exempts certain corporations from alternative minimum tax.  The alternative minimum tax paid in previous years will be available as a credit against a portion of the regular corporate income tax.
The Fund is qualified and currently conducts business in the State of Florida. The Fund is subject to Florida corporate taxes but is not subject to alternative minimum tax in any year which the Fund does not pay a federal alternative minimum tax.  Consistent with the federal quidelines, the Fund will be entitled to a credit against a portion of the regular corporate income tax for alternative minimum tax paid in prior fiscal years.

In accordance with FASB-109, Accounting for Income Taxes (applicable for fiscal years commencing after December 31, 1992), the Copley Fund, Inc., has adopted the liability method of accounting for current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

  =========  ===========  =========  ===========	  
4. Purchases and Sales of Securities
  Purchases and sales of securities, other than United States government obligations and short-term notes, aggregated $724,225 and $2,337,557 respectively.
5. Investment Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Related Parties
  Copley Financial Services Corporation (CFSC), a Massachusetts
corporation, serves as investment advisor to the Fund. Irving Levine,
Chairman of the Board of the Fund, is the owner of all of the outstanding common stock of CFSC and serves as its President, Treasurer and a member of its Board of Directors.
  Under the Investment Advisory Contract, CFSC is entitled to an annual fee, payable monthly at the rate of 1.00% of the first $25 million of the average daily net assets; .75% of the next $15 million; and .50% on average daily net assets over $40 million.
  Since September 1, 1978, in order to encourage the growth of the net asset value of the Fund by keeping expenses to a minimum, CFSC has waived a portion of the investment advisory fee on the first $15 million of average net assets. CFSC has made no commitment to continue this policy.
  For the six months ended August 31, 1998, the fee for investment
advisory service totaled $267,034, less fees of $30,000 voluntarily waived.  Also, during the period unaffiliated directors received $11,996 in directors' fees.
  The Fund's operating division, which imports merchandise for resale, places a portion of its merchandise on consignment with a company controlled by Irving Levine. The Fund invoices the consignee when the merchandise is ultimately sold. Sales of merchandise to the affiliate amounted to $113,124 during the period.  An amount of $22,074 is receivable in respect of these sales as of August 31, 1998.

6. Notes Payable
  A $5,000,000 line of credit has been secured for the operating
division from Fleet National Bank. The assets of the Fund are pledged as security for this line of credit. The amount currently outstanding on this line is zero.

7. Commitments and Contingencies
  Since the Fund accumulates its net investment income rather than
distributing it, the Fund may be subject to the imposition of the federal accumulated earnings tax. The accumulated earnings tax is imposed on a corporation's accumulated taxable income at a rate of 39.6% for years commencing after December 31, 1992.
  Accumulated taxable income is defined as adjusted taxable income
minus the sum of the dividends paid deduction and the accumulated earnings credit. The dividends paid deduction and accumulated earnings credit is available only if the Fund is not held to be a mere holding or investment company.
  The Internal Revenue Service has recently upheld management's position that the Fund is not a mere holding or investment company since the Fund is conducting an operating business. Provided the Fund manages accumulated and annual earnings and profits, in excess of $250,000, in such a manner that the funds are deemed to be obligated or consumed by capital losses, redemptions and expansion of the operating division, the Fund should not be held liable for the accumulated earnings tax by the Internal Revenue Service.
