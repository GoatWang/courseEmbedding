Glimpses into the Princely Collections



For more than four hundred years, the Princes of Liechtenstein have been passionate art collectors. The Princely Collections include key works of European art stretching over five centuries and are now among the world’s major private art collections. At LGT, we make deliberate use of the works of art in the Princely Collections as imagery to accompany what we do. For us, they embody those values that form the basis for a successful partnership with our clients: a long-term focus, skill and individuality.

LGT Navigator: ECB turnaround discussion starting in fall 
The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its key interest rates unchanged on record lows, therefore also its monetary stimulus unchanged, as widely expected. ECB President Mario Draghi seems to be willing to hold on to the central bank’s ultra-expansive monetary policy bias, disappointing hopes of many market participants to deliver a clear signal for a change in policy. Despite signs of an improving economy in the euro zone, the central bank seems to regard the inflation trend as too uncertain. However, Draghi also said that the ECB could start discussing whether a policy adjustment is appropriate.

Improving quality of life, opening up future prospects

Billions of people worldwide are living under the minimum subsistence level. They need support with such basic things as education, work, health or energy. Businesses must play their part too by living up to their social responsibilities and showing commitment to sustainable development















More information





The LGT Venture Philanthropy Foundation (LGT VP) was founded in 2007 at the behest of H.S.H. Prince Max von und zu Liechtenstein. The aim of the foundation is to improve the quality of life of disadvantaged people and offer them some prospects for the future.
LGT VP provides worldwide support - in the form of investments and donations - to social organizations and businesses that offer an effective solution to a social or environmental problem. This financial assistance really helps the organizations, but just as important are the transfer of knowledge and access to networks.









Objective-driven, efficient and transparent use of funds


Organizations admitted to the LGT Venture Philanthropy portfolio must undergo a detailed audit process and achieve jointly defined objectives. They need to have developed innovative and replicable models designed to make sustainable improvements to the quality of life of disadvantaged people. The use of proven investment, management and controlling processes is intended to ensure that the funds entrusted to the parties concerned are deployed in an objective-driven, efficient and transparent manner. This is the only way of achieving a sustainable positive impact for disadvantaged people.



























"The whole of society is responsible for helping disadvantaged people and those with meager incomes and offering them a fair chance to enjoy a self-determined life."
H.S.H. Prince Max von und zu Liechtenstein, CEO LGT and member of the Foundation Board of LGT VP













How you can make a philanthropic commitment
Thanks to its teams on the ground, LGT VP has a presence in six regions around the world with key local networks and partnerships. By turning the commitment of the Princely Family into action, it has built up extensive experience and developed tried-and-tested processes and systems to ensure a commitment to philanthropy that will deliver success. LGT VP draws on this comprehensive expertise to advise our clients and help them implement their own philanthropic commitments with successful results.
Clients can support the following non-profit organizations by making a donation.

For the benefit of the environment and societySustainable thinking and acting is part of our corporate philosophy.











Glimpses into the Princely Collections



For more than four hundred years, the Princes of Liechtenstein have been passionate art collectors. The Princely Collections include key works of European art stretching over five centuries and are now among the world’s major private art collections. At LGT, we make deliberate use of the works of art in the Princely Collections as imagery to accompany what we do. For us, they embody those values that form the basis for a successful partnership with our clients: a long-term focus, skill and individuality.

Thinking in terms of generations

Thinking and acting in a forward-looking manner creates and upholds values: We feel an obligation to our employees, society and the environment to take responsibility and play our part in securing a future worth living in.























Our understanding of sustainability

We scrutinize the impact of our activities across the board. Social engagement, responsible investing and using resources sparingly all form an integral part of our corporate responsibility.



More on LGT’s social responsibility

























Sustainable investments

LGT has signed up to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and is thus committed to following them. We offer our clients investment opportunities with a social and financial return.



Sustainable investment solutions


























"For several years now, LGT has used its position as a leading investor in private equity funds to bring about a stronger focus on social and environmental values across the entire sector."
