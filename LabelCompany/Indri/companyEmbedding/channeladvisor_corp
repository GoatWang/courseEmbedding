            Is Google Shopping Expanding the Mobile Carousel?          
Hop on board because the mobile carousel just got a lot bigger.  
Most recently, we tended to see 15-20 product listing ads (PLAs) when conducting a mobile search on Google. However, while we were doing some searches this week, we found that in some cases, upwards of 30 products are featured. We’re guessing that Google’s found that consumers are more likely to engage with a larger number of options, hence the expansion.
What Does That Mean for Marketers?
In a word: visibility. This expansion is really just another step in making the search engine results page (SERP) more shoppable. A thirty product carousel starts to be much more similar to a typical category page on a retailer’s website. Starting with the launch of PLAs several years ago, followed by Purchases on Google and numerous other enhancements along the way (Merchant Promotions being a key one) the search results page is starting to look more and more like an e-commerce website.
For search marketers, this expansion is important because you now have more opportunities to be seen. Keep in mind that a change like this can result in changes to metrics like impression, share, and click share, so keep a close eye on those. As always, your mileage may vary as Google continues to test new formats such as this.
We’ll be monitoring this trend in the coming weeks and will update you with more information as it becomes available.

Keep in mind that a change like this can result in changes to metrics like impression, share, and click share, so keep a close eye on those. As always, your mileage may vary as Google continues to test new formats such as this.
We’ll be monitoring this trend in the coming weeks and will update you with more information as it becomes available.

            Does PageSpeed Matter for E-Commerce?          
We’ve known for years that Google rewards the relative load speed and performance of sites with more impressions and higher rank, but how much has always been the question.
Historically, we’ve seen many different aspects of site development, performance, and impact weighing heavily on search results, but speed has never been one of those coveted virtues.  
That is, until recently. 
Many search engines have indicated that the speed of sites will now have a greater impact on how sites rank than ever before.
E-commerce has always gotten a bit of pass in this regard.  It has been generally understood that large sites with expansive product offerings would always take more time to load and require more resources for performance. However, with improved server response time, enhanced JavaScript resources, and faster content management systems, the time has come for e-commerce sites to step up their game. 
This is especially true for mobile search.  
The Mobile Impact
As mobile search continues to dominate the SEO landscape, those of us working in e-commerce have mostly been exempt from concerns in this arena. Customers have largely used desktop computers to search for and complete their purchases, for reasons ranging from an increase in perceived security to better navigation through the conversion process.  
Well, the times have finally caught up to our industry, and mobile is now becoming an increasingly important factor for online businesses and the speed with which we can guide our customers through the conversion funnel matters.  Additionally, mobile is taking a larger share of all search traffic in general.  More and more searchers are turning to their mobile devices when searching online, and this trend is unlikely to change in the future.
What Can You Do?
So then, where do we start to establish a baseline for our sites’ speed and identify the problems that are bogging our site down?  Luckily, Google offers a free resource to see our speed and uncover our problems: PageSpeed Insights.  
Simply type in your landing page and click “Analyze”, and Google does the work from there.  This will deliver a speed score for both mobile and desktop versions of your site on a 100-point scale.  In addition, the report will tell you the issues that you ‘Should Fix’, ‘Consider Fixing’, and areas where you ‘Passed Rules,’ so you’ll have a good idea of what you need to work on, what you should consider for repairs in the future, and places on your site that pass Google’s standards. Many of the suggestions you’re likely to see will be fairly easy to fix, while some may be completely impossible.  
Below is a quick review of many of the common issues we see in these results:

Optimize your images. This is one issue that we see on nearly every site we review, and the great news is that it’s something that most site administrators can fix over time. This indicates that the images used on your site have either not been sized correctly or are lacking lossless compression. To add lossless compression to your images, you may use one of many free online tools like Tinypng or Compressor.io to compress the images without losing image quality. In addition, you may need to manually resize your images instead of relying on dynamic resizing. Making a very large image fit in a very small box can drastically slow the page rendering!
Leverage browser caching. Your site is probably using a lot of the same resources on every page, such as JavaScript, CSS, logos and images.  Instead of asking the browser to retrieve these resources on every page that a customer navigates to, why not instruct their browser to save these resources on their computer and reduce the amount of requests going to the server?  This is what browser caching is, and it can have a dramatic effect on your PageSpeed scores.
Minify JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. These are the usual files that any web page uses, and quite often they’re full of whitespace, comments, and unnecessary keystrokes that make it easier for developers to see and understand their layout.  However, the files that the end user needs to load don’t need these things, so we can eliminate these items to make the files as small as possible.  This process is called minifying, and there are free online tools like JSCompress and Minify that can do the hard work for you.  Simply copy the source code and submit, and they’ll return the minified code.
Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content. This is a very common issue, and it often provides the best opportunity for improvements to your page speed.  However, it’s often a very resource- and time-heavy process, as these types of files usually come baked in with your CMS, and it requires a lot of time and patience to unravel the code and restructure or eliminate the problems.  Quick answer: you’re probably just going to have to let this one go and live with the slower speed.
Reduce server response time. Google recommends that the server that hosts your site respond in less than 200ms.  If your server is taking too long, you should ask them why.  Typically, the host will make a few adjustments on their end, and you’re all set.  Easy!

In our experience, an average e-commerce homepage ranks somewhere between a 50 to 65, but many of the best sites have improved their scores into the 80s and beyond.  Take a few minutes today and test your homepage, a category page, and a product page and see how you stack up. You may be surprised to find that your score is much lower, and a few simple changes could give you a leg up on the competition.

            Optimize, Connect and Grow With the Spring 2017 Expanded Product Suite          
 
 ChannelAdvisor Expanded Product Suite | Spring 2017  from ChannelAdvisor

In case you missed the news, last month we announced our biggest product update — ever. Why such a big update? Because big things are happening in the e-commerce industry. According to the US Census Bureau, consumer spending in 2016 grew 16% YoY to a whopping $550 billion, and while traditional department stores saw a downturn in sales, online retailers grew by almost 11%. Things they are a’changing.
You see, the modern consumer has an increasingly complicated buying journey. The traditional consumer journey model that’s been the norm for so many years has changed — drastically. Today’s consumers have more sophisticated preferences due to the sheer amount of options they’re presented with. And we’re not just talking about the “endless aisle” phenomenon that companies like Amazon have spoiled us with. Technology has enabled consumers to completely customize their shopping experience — from discovery to purchase — to best fit their lives. Brands and retailers are now faced with the challenge of optimizing the steps needed to reach customers when, where and how they shop.
As industry leaders, it’s our goal to help brands and retailers get closer to the consumer path to purchase than ever before. This Spring’s Expanded Product Suite is designed around three pillars that will help our clients align with the new consumer journey: connect to customers, optimize operations and grow sales channels.
Check out the presentation above for a recap of some of the key features in our product suite update, and make sure the watch the free on-demand recording of last month’s webinar for a deeper dive into the tools we’ve tailored to help you grow sales, connect to more customers and optimize operations through actionable intelligence.

            Business Rules 101: Introduction to Business Rules          
Business rules are powerful tools that allow you to customize and transform your data from the information you have to the information you need. They can help you cut down on the need for additional attributes, allow you to apply logic, use formulas, manipulate date, or filter items.
Business rules can also be intimidating and confusing to new users of ChannelAdvisor. This blog post is the first in a new series designed to demystify the process of writing your own business rules.
Types of Business Rules
Let’s start by discussing the two types of business rules; generally referred to as inventory and marketplace rules. Inventory rules act on data coming into ChannelAdvisor, and Marketplace rules act on data as it leaves ChannelAdvisor. 
Inventory business rules are applied to an inventory template as data is brought into our system. They can reference columns in your upload file, but cannot reference data that already exists in ChannelAdvisor for the SKU.  The output of these rules will be stored into an inventory field in ChannelAdvisor that you can then map to your marketplace templates. These rules can be found under Inventory > Product Mapping > Business Rules.
Marketplace business rules are applied to outgoing data templates. While they’re normally called marketplace rules, the same rules can be used for webstores or digital marketing. These rules can reference inventory fields that exist in ChannelAdvisor and alter the data that’s sent to the marketplace prior to being sent. The output of the rules won’t  show in our system outside of rule and template previews. These rules can be found under many menus, but the most common are Marketplaces > Marketplace Name > Product Mapping > Business Rules.
Using the Business Rule Editor
Once you’re on one of the business rules pages, you can view existing rules or click on the ‘New Business Rule’ button in the upper left to create a new rule. This will open the business rule editor, as seen below (click to enlarge):

I’ve numbered certain portions of the screenshot so we can discuss them more easily.

This is where you enter the business rule name and description. Make sure the name is as precise as possible so you can easily find the rule in the future. For example, if I’m making a rule to adjust the brand field on my Amazon template, I might call the rule “Amazon Brand Rule”. In the description, I can enter more details about the rule. It’s a good practice to use this space to describe in words what the rule is doing, as well as to save any previous versions of the rule if you are making changes to an existing one.
The Editor is where you will compose or write the actual business rule function. We’ll come back to this in a moment and walk through writing a simple IF statement rule. The big thing to know now is that inventory fields are referenced with a $ and text strings need to be in quotes in rules.
The ‘Reference’ section has three tabs that will show you your available inventory fields and how to reference them in a rule, the functions you have available, what they do, and how to format them, as well as the lookup lists you can use in your rules.
Once you have a rule written in the Editor, you can use this section to pick a SKU you want to preview the rule on.  This will allow you to see what the rule will output on a given SKU.
Once you select a SKU in 4, the actual preview will show up here.  Keep in mind that if you use variations some fields will send a parent SKU value to the marketplace, so what you see in the rule preview won’t  always match what’s in the template preview.  This is also where any errors, if any,  will show up as you’ re writing the rule.

Writing a Business Rule
Now that we have the basics down, let’s start writing a rule.  For this example, I’m going to write a rule that will take the brand name “Acme Co.” and send the value “Acme”. For all other brands, it should send the brand name unchanged.
First, we’ll want to look at the Inventory Fields and Functions tabs under ‘Reference’ to find what we’ll need to build the rule.  Under ‘Inventory Fields’, we see ‘Brand ($itembrand)’ so to reference the brand in a rule, we need to use the reference $itembrand.  We know that we want to use an IF statement, that’s formatted as:
IF(conditional statement, true return, false return)
So, the conditional statement we’re interested in is if the brand name is “Acme Co.” If it is, then the true return would be “Acme” and if not, the false return is the brand.  Putting this into the rule, we generally have:
IF(brand is “Acme Co.”, “Acme”, brand)
We know that brand can be referenced as $itembrand, so taking this a step further, we have:
IF($itembrand=”Acme Co.”, “Acme”, $itembrand)
This is how it all looks in the Editor (click to enlarge):

We gave the rule a good name and description so we’ll remember what the rule does in the future and where we intend to use it.  We also have the rule expression in the Editor.
Notice how the Editor uses different colors for different parts of the rule.  Purple is used for functions, blue for field references, and strings are in red.  If your cursor is next to a parenthesis, it will highlight the corresponding opening or closing parenthesis in green or will be red to indicate that there isn’t a corresponding one.
These colors are a good indication that you’re writing the rule correctly.  Please also note that the preview will show errors in the rule, for example, if I typed “$itembrad” instead of “$itembrand” it would indicate it as an error in the preview (click to enlarge):

Once a rule is created and saved, you need to still map it to the marketplace or inventory template before it’s applied.  To do this, open the template in question and click on the field to map it.  Select the ‘Business Rule’ button and search for the rule you created. Select it and then click ‘Done’ and save the template changes.

On the next sync to the marketplace, your items will update to send the business rule output values.
Business rules are a great way to help optimize your business.  Hopefully, you’re a bit more familiar with them now.  In upcoming blog posts, we’ll explore additional functions, as well as how to combine multiple functions into one rule.
Things to Consider
While business rules are powerful, it’s important to remember that they have their limits.  Rules can only work on a single SKU at a time, so they can’t compare values across SKUs, even ones in the same variation.  It may sound obvious, but keep in mind that rules can’t read your mind.  In order to write a business rule, you need to be able to define which criteria need to be used for all of your items.  If you find yourself coming up with too many exceptions or your data input isn’t consistent, it might be better to create a new attribute to store your data.

            Business Rules 101: Introduction to Business Rules          
Business rules are powerful tools that allow you to customize and transform your data from the information you have to the information you need. They can help you cut down on the need for additional attributes, allow you to apply logic, use formulas, manipulate date, or filter items.
Business rules can also be intimidating and confusing to new users of ChannelAdvisor. This blog post is the first in a new series designed to demystify the process of writing your own business rules.
Types of Business Rules
Let’s start by discussing the two types of business rules; generally referred to as inventory and marketplace rules. Inventory rules act on data coming into ChannelAdvisor, and Marketplace rules act on data as it leaves ChannelAdvisor. 
Inventory business rules are applied to an inventory template as data is brought into our system. They can reference columns in your upload file, but cannot reference data that already exists in ChannelAdvisor for the SKU.  The output of these rules will be stored into an inventory field in ChannelAdvisor that you can then map to your marketplace templates. These rules can be found under Inventory > Product Mapping > Business Rules.
Marketplace business rules are applied to outgoing data templates. While they’re normally called marketplace rules, the same rules can be used for webstores or digital marketing. These rules can reference inventory fields that exist in ChannelAdvisor and alter the data that’s sent to the marketplace prior to being sent. The output of the rules won’t  show in our system outside of rule and template previews. These rules can be found under many menus, but the most common are Marketplaces > Marketplace Name > Product Mapping > Business Rules.
Using the Business Rule Editor
Once you’re on one of the business rules pages, you can view existing rules or click on the ‘New Business Rule’ button in the upper left to create a new rule. This will open the business rule editor, as seen below (click to enlarge):

I’ve numbered certain portions of the screenshot so we can discuss them more easily.

This is where you enter the business rule name and description. Make sure the name is as precise as possible so you can easily find the rule in the future. For example, if I’m making a rule to adjust the brand field on my Amazon template, I might call the rule “Amazon Brand Rule”. In the description, I can enter more details about the rule. It’s a good practice to use this space to describe in words what the rule is doing, as well as to save any previous versions of the rule if you are making changes to an existing one.
The Editor is where you will compose or write the actual business rule function. We’ll come back to this in a moment and walk through writing a simple IF statement rule. The big thing to know now is that inventory fields are referenced with a $ and text strings need to be in quotes in rules.
The ‘Reference’ section has three tabs that will show you your available inventory fields and how to reference them in a rule, the functions you have available, what they do, and how to format them, as well as the lookup lists you can use in your rules.
Once you have a rule written in the Editor, you can use this section to pick a SKU you want to preview the rule on.  This will allow you to see what the rule will output on a given SKU.

      The ChannelAdvisor Story    




Home | About | Our Story 








In the early years, e-commerce was fairly simple. We know, because we were there.
But e-commerce grew. Quickly. It became more complex, more fragmented, more crowded and more competitive. We know, because we were there.
And now, more channels, more devices, more countries and more consumers are changing the landscape every day.
We know, because we’re still here.
ChannelAdvisor has been on the front lines of e-commerce since 2001, helping retailers and brands connect with customers, optimize operations and grow sales channels. We’ve grown from a small company in a young industry to an industry leader at the forefront of a global revolution — with thousands of clients and billions of dollars in transactional revenue flowing through our platform every year.

And the things that grew to define the ChannelAdvisor brand over the last 15 years — constant innovation, leading technology, proven results and experienced people — are still our guiding principles as we continue to take retailers and brands into the future of e-commerce.
We’re here to connect your products to wherever you want them to go, but we’re also here to connect you and your products to whatever comes next.
That means being the first to integrate with new channels and new ways of shopping. It means connecting retailers and brands through shared data and insights. It means calming the chaos and helping you track, manage and grow your inventory and scale your business.

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, North Carolina — ChannelAdvisor Corporation has acquired HubLogix Commerce Corp, a fulfillment and logistics platform that automates order management by connecting online storefronts and marketplaces to distribution and fulfillment centres.
Based in Boston, HubLogix can help improve order accuracy and fulfillment speed for its customers, which can lower customers’ fulfillment costs and create competitive advantages for their customers’ businesses.
“Earlier this year we announced the launch of our Fulfillment Network and our dedication to helping our customers streamline their logistics and provide the best customer experience down to the last mile. This acquisition provides us the technology and expertise to further enhance our fulfillment offering and capabilities,” said David Spitz, ChannelAdvisor CEO.
“We’ve worked with HubLogix for years and have always been impressed with the team’s knowledge of the space and the value they provide. We’re delighted to welcome the HubLogix team to the ChannelAdvisor family and we look forward to future shared success.”
As part of its platform’s fulfillment automation capabilities, HubLogix has developed a network of more than 150 fulfillment partners to allow sellers to work efficiently with their vendors and third-party logistics partners.
With the acquisition of HubLogix, ChannelAdvisor strengthens its product suite with the addition of fulfillment automation, while also adding a talented team of distribution, fulfillment and supply chain domain experts to the organization.
“ChannelAdvisor has a history of industry leadership, so we’re thrilled to join forces and add our knowledge and technology to the ChannelAdvisor product suite,” said Christian Hassold, HubLogix CEO. “Together we can solve the market’s need for an end-to-end solution that optimizes online and offline commerce.”
Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. ChannelAdvisor does not anticipate a material impact to 2017 revenue or adjusted EBITDA as a result of the transaction.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
