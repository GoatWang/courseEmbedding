Our Science

One of the most exciting advances in cancer is an innovative approach that involves removing a patient’s immune cells, engineering those cells to identify cancer, then infusing those cells in the patient to kill cancer. We have long believed in the promise of engineering T cells to treat certain blood cancers and our singular focus is developing cell therapy.
See Our Research

Our Technology

We are developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. Our dual platform has the potential to change the paradigm of cancer therapy and address both hematological and solid tumor cancers.
Explore Our Technology

Our Pipeline

We have one of the leading pipelines in cell therapy within the industry. Our CAR pipeline currently includes our lead investigational therapy that has the potential to become a franchise and address a range of blood cancers, and next generation technologies.  Our TCR pipeline includes investigational therapies that have the potential to address a range of solid tumors.

Our Mission
Changing the Paradigm of Cancer Treatment
For the past three decades, members of our team have been at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy. Today, we are a leader in engineered T cell therapy, transforming cancer treatment with what is potentially the biggest breakthrough since the introduction of combination chemotherapy more than 60 years ago.



To bring about this transformation, we're developing innovative products that harness a patient's own immune system to target and kill cancer cells. In just three years, our singular focus and strategic collaborations, including multiple Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with the National Cancer Institute, have enabled us to advance an industry-leading pipeline of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates to address both hematological (blood-based) and solid cancers.

Kite by the Numbers

 Clinical Trial Manufacturing Success Rate based on ZUMA-1 trial

Leadership

At Kite, we've recruited the best Management Team, Board and Advisors with the vast experience in all facets of the industry to pave a new road for cancer treatment. Each person brings to Kite a special talent and unique perspective that allows us to together, successfully achieve each milestone and bring us one step closer to our unified vision.

 Technology 
Harnessing the Power of the Immune System
T cells are critical to the immune system’s ability to detect and kill cancer cells. However, the immune system is unable to kill cancer cells when tumor-specific T cells are deficient in number, are unable to function properly or fail to recognize cancer as foreign to the body.
We are developing novel T cell-based cancer immunotherapies intended to directly address this problem. Our engineered cell therapy technology is designed to harness the power of a patient’s own immune system to effectively target and kill cancer cells.
Explore CAR T Explore TCR



Collect patient's white blood cells




Isolate and activate T cells




Grow and expand number of T cells




Infuse patient with engineered T cells




One Mission, Two Platforms
We are developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. Our dual platform has the potential to address both hematological and solid tumor cancers.


The Science of CAR T

Play CAR Video
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)
CARs are engineered proteins composed of two distinct functional components. The first consists of an antibody fragment or target binding domain that allows CARs to recognize targets that are present on the surface of cancer cells. The second provides signals that rapidly and powerfully activate the T cell to attack and kill cancer cells. We are developing multiple CAR product candidates, including KTE-C19, while continuing to innovate the next generation of CAR-engineered T cells to achieve even greater results.



The Science of CAR T

Play TCR Video
T Cell Receptor (TCR)
TCRs are proteins that allow T cells to identify cancer targets presented on the surface of cancer cells or inside cancer cells. Endogenous TCRs that are specific to a cancer can be isolated and then engineered into a large number of T cells that recognize and attack various types of solid and hematologic cancers. Kite, in collaboration with its partners, is currently advancing several TCR-engineered T cell programs that target cancer-specific proteins such as cancer testis antigens, viral antigens and neo antigens. Kite is also leveraging its proprietary TCR-GENErator™ discovery platform for rapid, high-throughput identification of TCR-based product candidates.

Juno Therapeutics stock drops 5% after BTIG downgrades to sell
Juno Therapeutics Inc.  shares dropped 5.2% in premarket trade Thursday after BTIG downgraded it to sell from neutral, with a $12 price target. Juno shares closed at $23.73 on Wednesday. The company is "trailing" competitors like Kite Pharma Inc.  and Novartis AG  to market and there is "little demonstrative proof" that Juno drugs work better or have fewer life-threatening side effects, BTIG analyst Dane Leone said. The company's lack of progress casts questions about its management, Leone said, who also criticized Juno Chief Executive Hans Bishop. "We do not think the impetus is currently in place (activism) but the company has built out a CAR T infrastructure with backing from Celgene  which could be valuable if managed correctly," he said. Not all analysts agree with Leone's poor assessment of Juno: Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said on Wednesday that "we think the JUNO weakness on competitive fears is unwarranted and believe JUNO's JCAR017 product looks very competitive to both NVS' and KITE's data... when compared apples to apples." More time is needed to compare the products, he said, with Juno on track to start a pivotal study in the second half of this year. After several patients in a clinical trial for Juno's JCAR015 drug died last year, the company later announced it would discontinue the drug's development.

Meanwhile, it's dealing with a

Juno Therapeutics stock drops 5% after BTIG downgrades to sell
Juno Therapeutics Inc.  shares dropped 5.2% in premarket trade Thursday after BTIG downgraded it to sell from neutral, with a $12 price target. Juno shares closed at $23.73 on Wednesday. The company is "trailing" competitors like Kite Pharma Inc.  and Novartis AG  to market and there is "little demonstrative proof" that Juno drugs work better or have fewer life-threatening side effects, BTIG analyst Dane Leone said. The company's lack of progress casts questions about its management, Leone said, who also criticized Juno Chief Executive Hans Bishop. "We do not think the impetus is currently in place (activism) but the company has built out a CAR T infrastructure with backing from Celgene  which could be valuable if managed correctly," he said. Not all analysts agree with Leone's poor assessment of Juno: Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said on Wednesday that "we think the JUNO weakness on competitive fears is unwarranted and believe JUNO's JCAR017 product looks very competitive to both NVS' and KITE's data... when compared apples to apples." More time is needed to compare the products, he said, with Juno on track to start a pivotal study in the second half of this year. After several patients in a clinical trial for Juno's JCAR015 drug died last year, the company later announced it would discontinue the drug's development. Juno and other companies are developing a similar type of cancer treatment, but rivals have garnered more positive results. Recent clinical trial results from rival Bluebird Bio  prompted a J.P. Morgan analyst to christen the company "the clear winner" at a major cancer conference this past weekend. Juno shares have risen 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: Analyst
Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet. Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Meanwhile, it's dealing with a

Pipeline[edit]

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19, ZUMA-3) is an investigational therapy (for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] It has US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (Dec 2015) for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Development history[edit]
2012[edit]
In October, Kite Pharma entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of multiple cancer indications.[5]
2013[edit]
In December, the company announced data in its lead clinical development program with the NCI, demonstrating that Kite’s most advanced immunotherapy product candidate – KTE-C19 CAR – can produce robust and durable tumor shrinkage in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[6] The clinical data were presented at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.[7]
2014[edit]
In March, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designation for the company's proposed therapy for DLBCL.[8]
In June, Kite Pharma entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to certain intellectual property related to TCR-based product candidates that target the NY-ESO-1 antigen for the treatment of cancers expressing NY-ESO-1.[9]
In August, Kite Pharma announced findings from its ongoing clinical trial: 12 of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies had complete remissions (8 patients) or partial remissions (4 patients) resulting in a 92% objective response rate. The results support Kite Pharma's plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fourth quarter of 2014 to initiate a clinical trial of Kite Pharma's lead CAR-based product candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with DLBCL.[10]
2015[edit]
In January, Kite Pharma and Amgen entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize the next generation of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies based on Kite's engineered autologous cell therapy platform and Amgen's extensive array of cancer targets.[11][12]
In May, Kite Pharma announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma has been treated.[13]
In June, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies.[14]
In July, Kite Pharma and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society announced that they have entered into a partnership to enhance the development of Kite's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[15]

AIS will grant Kite an exclusive license to two programs from its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, which Kite plans to further engineer into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates. This collaboration will accelerate Kite's efforts to establish the next generation of engineered T cell therapies specifically designed to overcome the inhibitory mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironment.[18][19]
In December, Kite Pharma announced that it has initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of KTE-C19 (ZUMA-3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] In the same month, Kite Pharma and GE Global Research announced they will partner to develop a next-generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T-cell therapy. Kite and GE Global Research—GE’s centralized R&D hub—said they aim to increase the availability of engineered T-cell therapies by speeding up development of automation technologies that have the potential to lower costs, operate faster, and minimize variability.[20] Also in December, Kite announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to the Company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Pipeline[edit]

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19, ZUMA-3) is an investigational therapy (for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] It has US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (Dec 2015) for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Development history[edit]
2012[edit]
In October, Kite Pharma entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of multiple cancer indications.[5]
2013[edit]
In December, the company announced data in its lead clinical development program with the NCI, demonstrating that Kite’s most advanced immunotherapy product candidate – KTE-C19 CAR – can produce robust and durable tumor shrinkage in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[6] The clinical data were presented at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.[7]
2014[edit]
In March, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designation for the company's proposed therapy for DLBCL.[8]
In June, Kite Pharma entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to certain intellectual property related to TCR-based product candidates that target the NY-ESO-1 antigen for the treatment of cancers expressing NY-ESO-1.[9]
In August, Kite Pharma announced findings from its ongoing clinical trial: 12 of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies had complete remissions (8 patients) or partial remissions (4 patients) resulting in a 92% objective response rate. The results support Kite Pharma's plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fourth quarter of 2014 to initiate a clinical trial of Kite Pharma's lead CAR-based product candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with DLBCL.[10]
2015[edit]
In January, Kite Pharma and Amgen entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize the next generation of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies based on Kite's engineered autologous cell therapy platform and Amgen's extensive array of cancer targets.[11][12]
In May, Kite Pharma announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma has been treated.[13]
In June, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies.[14]
In July, Kite Pharma and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society announced that they have entered into a partnership to enhance the development of Kite's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[15]
In September, Kite Pharma announced that it has expanded its collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Kite and the NKI have entered into an agreement under which Kite will receive from the NKI the exclusive option to license multiple T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy candidates targeting solid tumors. Kite has also expanded its access to additional resources and research facilities through a master services agreement with the NKI.[16]
In October, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for intellectual property related to T cell receptor (TCR)-based product candidates directed against MAGE A3 and A3/A6 antigens for the treatment of tumors expressing MAGE, which include lung, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers, among others.[17] In the same month, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a worldwide research and license agreement with Alpine Immune Sciences (AIS), a privately held biotechnology startup, to discover and develop protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer. AIS will grant Kite an exclusive license to two programs from its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, which Kite plans to further engineer into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates. This collaboration will accelerate Kite's efforts to establish the next generation of engineered T cell therapies specifically designed to overcome the inhibitory mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironment.[18][19]
In December, Kite Pharma announced that it has initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of KTE-C19 (ZUMA-3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] In the same month, Kite Pharma and GE Global Research announced they will partner to develop a next-generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T-cell therapy. Kite and GE Global Research—GE’s centralized R&D hub—said they aim to increase the availability of engineered T-cell therapies by speeding up development of automation technologies that have the potential to lower costs, operate faster, and minimize variability.[20] Also in December, Kite announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to the Company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]
2016[edit]
It was announced that Kite Pharma will present at the 34th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2016.[21] Also in January, it was announced that Kite Pharma has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NCI for the research and clinical development of a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidate for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[22] Moreover, Kite Pharma announced that its European subsidiary has entered into a research and license agreement with Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) to identify and develop T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates targeting solid tumors that are associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection.[23]
In March, Kite Pharma has announced that it would be collaborating with Genentech, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two of its novel therapies. The target population for the tests would be patients suffering from non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The therapies in question, KTE-C19 and atezolizumab, would be tested in combination with each other.[24]
In June, Kite Pharma and Cell Design Labs, Inc. announced a research collaboration and license agreement to develop next generation, precision-controlled chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidates that incorporate Cell Design Labs’ molecular “on/off switch” technology.[25] Also in June, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a new Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the research and clinical development of T-cell receptor (TCR) product candidates directed against human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers.[26]
In July, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, on behalf of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for technology to advance the development of off-the-shelf allogeneic T-cell therapies from renewable pluripotent stem cells.[27]

Pipeline[edit]

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19, ZUMA-3) is an investigational therapy (for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] It has US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (Dec 2015) for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Development history[edit]
2012[edit]
In October, Kite Pharma entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of multiple cancer indications.[5]
2013[edit]
In December, the company announced data in its lead clinical development program with the NCI, demonstrating that Kite’s most advanced immunotherapy product candidate – KTE-C19 CAR – can produce robust and durable tumor shrinkage in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[6] The clinical data were presented at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.[7]
2014[edit]
In March, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designation for the company's proposed therapy for DLBCL.[8]
In June, Kite Pharma entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to certain intellectual property related to TCR-based product candidates that target the NY-ESO-1 antigen for the treatment of cancers expressing NY-ESO-1.[9]
In August, Kite Pharma announced findings from its ongoing clinical trial: 12 of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies had complete remissions (8 patients) or partial remissions (4 patients) resulting in a 92% objective response rate. The results support Kite Pharma's plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fourth quarter of 2014 to initiate a clinical trial of Kite Pharma's lead CAR-based product candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with DLBCL.[10]
2015[edit]
In January, Kite Pharma and Amgen entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize the next generation of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies based on Kite's engineered autologous cell therapy platform and Amgen's extensive array of cancer targets.[11][12]
In May, Kite Pharma announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma has been treated.[13]
In June, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies.[14]
In July, Kite Pharma and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society announced that they have entered into a partnership to enhance the development of Kite's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[15]
In September, Kite Pharma announced that it has expanded its collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Kite and the NKI have entered into an agreement under which Kite will receive from the NKI the exclusive option to license multiple T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy candidates targeting solid tumors. Kite has also expanded its access to additional resources and research facilities through a master services agreement with the NKI.[16]
In October, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for intellectual property related to T cell receptor (TCR)-based product candidates directed against MAGE A3 and A3/A6 antigens for the treatment of tumors expressing MAGE, which include lung, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers, among others.[17] In the same month, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a worldwide research and license agreement with Alpine Immune Sciences (AIS), a privately held biotechnology startup, to discover and develop protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer. AIS will grant Kite an exclusive license to two programs from its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, which Kite plans to further engineer into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates. This collaboration will accelerate Kite's efforts to establish the next generation of engineered T cell therapies specifically designed to overcome the inhibitory mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironment.[18][19]
In December, Kite Pharma announced that it has initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of KTE-C19 (ZUMA-3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] In the same month, Kite Pharma and GE Global Research announced they will partner to develop a next-generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T-cell therapy. Kite and GE Global Research—GE’s centralized R&D hub—said they aim to increase the availability of engineered T-cell therapies by speeding up development of automation technologies that have the potential to lower costs, operate faster, and minimize variability.[20] Also in December, Kite announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to the Company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]
2016[edit]
It was announced that Kite Pharma will present at the 34th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2016.[21] Also in January, it was announced that Kite Pharma has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NCI for the research and clinical development of a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidate for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[22] Moreover, Kite Pharma announced that its European subsidiary has entered into a research and license agreement with Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) to identify and develop T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates targeting solid tumors that are associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection.[23]
In March, Kite Pharma has announced that it would be collaborating with Genentech, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two of its novel therapies. The target population for the tests would be patients suffering from non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The therapies in question, KTE-C19 and atezolizumab, would be tested in combination with each other.[24]
In June, Kite Pharma and Cell Design Labs, Inc. announced a research collaboration and license agreement to develop next generation, precision-controlled chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidates that incorporate Cell Design Labs’ molecular “on/off switch” technology.[25] Also in June, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a new Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the research and clinical development of T-cell receptor (TCR) product candidates directed against human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers.[26]
In July, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, on behalf of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for technology to advance the development of off-the-shelf allogeneic T-cell therapies from renewable pluripotent stem cells.[27]
In December, Kite Pharma and Vitruvian Networks, Inc., a pioneering cell and gene therapy software and analytics platform company co-founded by GE Ventures and the Mayo Clinic, announced a strategic partnership to create a software solution to support commercial availability of T-cell therapies. Together, the parties will design and develop a platform for patients, physicians and treatment centers that enables commercial-scale ordering, logistics, monitoring and delivery of autologous cell therapies if they are FDA-approved, including axicabtagene ciloleucel (formerly known as KTE-C19), Kite’s lead investigational engineered T-cell therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[28]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Pipeline[edit]

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19, ZUMA-3) is an investigational therapy (for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] It has US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (Dec 2015) for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Development history[edit]
2012[edit]
In October, Kite Pharma entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of multiple cancer indications.[5]
2013[edit]
In December, the company announced data in its lead clinical development program with the NCI, demonstrating that Kite’s most advanced immunotherapy product candidate – KTE-C19 CAR – can produce robust and durable tumor shrinkage in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[6] The clinical data were presented at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.[7]
2014[edit]
In March, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designation for the company's proposed therapy for DLBCL.[8]
In June, Kite Pharma entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to certain intellectual property related to TCR-based product candidates that target the NY-ESO-1 antigen for the treatment of cancers expressing NY-ESO-1.[9]
In August, Kite Pharma announced findings from its ongoing clinical trial: 12 of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies had complete remissions (8 patients) or partial remissions (4 patients) resulting in a 92% objective response rate. The results support Kite Pharma's plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fourth quarter of 2014 to initiate a clinical trial of Kite Pharma's lead CAR-based product candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with DLBCL.[10]
2015[edit]
In January, Kite Pharma and Amgen entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize the next generation of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies based on Kite's engineered autologous cell therapy platform and Amgen's extensive array of cancer targets.[11][12]
In May, Kite Pharma announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma has been treated.[13]
In June, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies.[14]
In July, Kite Pharma and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society announced that they have entered into a partnership to enhance the development of Kite's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[15]
In September, Kite Pharma announced that it has expanded its collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Kite and the NKI have entered into an agreement under which Kite will receive from the NKI the exclusive option to license multiple T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy candidates targeting solid tumors. Kite has also expanded its access to additional resources and research facilities through a master services agreement with the NKI.[16]
In October, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for intellectual property related to T cell receptor (TCR)-based product candidates directed against MAGE A3 and A3/A6 antigens for the treatment of tumors expressing MAGE, which include lung, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers, among others.[17] In the same month, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a worldwide research and license agreement with Alpine Immune Sciences (AIS), a privately held biotechnology startup, to discover and develop protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer. AIS will grant Kite an exclusive license to two programs from its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, which Kite plans to further engineer into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates. This collaboration will accelerate Kite's efforts to establish the next generation of engineered T cell therapies specifically designed to overcome the inhibitory mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironment.[18][19]
In December, Kite Pharma announced that it has initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of KTE-C19 (ZUMA-3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] In the same month, Kite Pharma and GE Global Research announced they will partner to develop a next-generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T-cell therapy. Kite and GE Global Research—GE’s centralized R&D hub—said they aim to increase the availability of engineered T-cell therapies by speeding up development of automation technologies that have the potential to lower costs, operate faster, and minimize variability.[20] Also in December, Kite announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to the Company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]
2016[edit]
It was announced that Kite Pharma will present at the 34th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2016.[21] Also in January, it was announced that Kite Pharma has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NCI for the research and clinical development of a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidate for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[22] Moreover, Kite Pharma announced that its European subsidiary has entered into a research and license agreement with Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) to identify and develop T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates targeting solid tumors that are associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection.[23]
In March, Kite Pharma has announced that it would be collaborating with Genentech, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two of its novel therapies. The target population for the tests would be patients suffering from non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The therapies in question, KTE-C19 and atezolizumab, would be tested in combination with each other.[24]
In June, Kite Pharma and Cell Design Labs, Inc. announced a research collaboration and license agreement to develop next generation, precision-controlled chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidates that incorporate Cell Design Labs’ molecular “on/off switch” technology.[25] Also in June, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a new Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the research and clinical development of T-cell receptor (TCR) product candidates directed against human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers.[26]
In July, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, on behalf of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for technology to advance the development of off-the-shelf allogeneic T-cell therapies from renewable pluripotent stem cells.[27]
In December, Kite Pharma and Vitruvian Networks, Inc., a pioneering cell and gene therapy software and analytics platform company co-founded by GE Ventures and the Mayo Clinic, announced a strategic partnership to create a software solution to support commercial availability of T-cell therapies. Together, the parties will design and develop a platform for patients, physicians and treatment centers that enables commercial-scale ordering, logistics, monitoring and delivery of autologous cell therapies if they are FDA-approved, including axicabtagene ciloleucel (formerly known as KTE-C19), Kite’s lead investigational engineered T-cell therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[28]
2017[edit]
In March, Kite announced results a clinical trial of CAR-T cells in around a hundred people with advanced Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[29]
In April, Kite has won the ‘Clinical Trial Result of the Year’ award for its CAR-T trial of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in patients with Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma at the 2017 Clinical and Research Excellence Awards. The award recognizes clinical achievements in the pharmaceutical industry and contribution to the advancement of therapies for unmet medical needs.[30]

Our Science

One of the most exciting advances in cancer is an innovative approach that involves removing a patient’s immune cells, engineering those cells to identify cancer, then infusing those cells in the patient to kill cancer. We have long believed in the promise of engineering T cells to treat certain blood cancers and our singular focus is developing cell therapy.
See Our Research

Our Technology

We are developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. Our dual platform has the potential to change the paradigm of cancer therapy and address both hematological and solid tumor cancers.
Explore Our Technology

Our Pipeline

We have one of the leading pipelines in cell therapy within the industry. Our CAR pipeline currently includes our lead investigational therapy that has the potential to become a franchise and address a range of blood cancers, and next generation technologies.  Our TCR pipeline includes investigational therapies that have the potential to address a range of solid tumors.

Pipeline[edit]

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19, ZUMA-3) is an investigational therapy (for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] It has US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (Dec 2015) for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Development history[edit]
2012[edit]
In October, Kite Pharma entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of multiple cancer indications.[5]
2013[edit]
In December, the company announced data in its lead clinical development program with the NCI, demonstrating that Kite’s most advanced immunotherapy product candidate – KTE-C19 CAR – can produce robust and durable tumor shrinkage in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[6] The clinical data were presented at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.[7]
2014[edit]
In March, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designation for the company's proposed therapy for DLBCL.[8]
In June, Kite Pharma entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to certain intellectual property related to TCR-based product candidates that target the NY-ESO-1 antigen for the treatment of cancers expressing NY-ESO-1.[9]
In August, Kite Pharma announced findings from its ongoing clinical trial: 12 of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies had complete remissions (8 patients) or partial remissions (4 patients) resulting in a 92% objective response rate. The results support Kite Pharma's plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fourth quarter of 2014 to initiate a clinical trial of Kite Pharma's lead CAR-based product candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with DLBCL.[10]
2015[edit]
In January, Kite Pharma and Amgen entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize the next generation of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies based on Kite's engineered autologous cell therapy platform and Amgen's extensive array of cancer targets.[11][12]
In May, Kite Pharma announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma has been treated.[13]
In June, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies.[14]
In July, Kite Pharma and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society announced that they have entered into a partnership to enhance the development of Kite's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[15]
In September, Kite Pharma announced that it has expanded its collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Kite and the NKI have entered into an agreement under which Kite will receive from the NKI the exclusive option to license multiple T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy candidates targeting solid tumors. Kite has also expanded its access to additional resources and research facilities through a master services agreement with the NKI.[16]
In October, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for intellectual property related to T cell receptor (TCR)-based product candidates directed against MAGE A3 and A3/A6 antigens for the treatment of tumors expressing MAGE, which include lung, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers, among others.[17] In the same month, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a worldwide research and license agreement with Alpine Immune Sciences (AIS), a privately held biotechnology startup, to discover and develop protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer. AIS will grant Kite an exclusive license to two programs from its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, which Kite plans to further engineer into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates. This collaboration will accelerate Kite's efforts to establish the next generation of engineered T cell therapies specifically designed to overcome the inhibitory mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironment.[18][19]
In December, Kite Pharma announced that it has initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of KTE-C19 (ZUMA-3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] In the same month, Kite Pharma and GE Global Research announced they will partner to develop a next-generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T-cell therapy. Kite and GE Global Research—GE’s centralized R&D hub—said they aim to increase the availability of engineered T-cell therapies by speeding up development of automation technologies that have the potential to lower costs, operate faster, and minimize variability.[20] Also in December, Kite announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to the Company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Pipeline[edit]

Axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19, ZUMA-3) is an investigational therapy (for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] It has US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (Dec 2015) for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]

Development history[edit]
2012[edit]
In October, Kite Pharma entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of multiple cancer indications.[5]
2013[edit]
In December, the company announced data in its lead clinical development program with the NCI, demonstrating that Kite’s most advanced immunotherapy product candidate – KTE-C19 CAR – can produce robust and durable tumor shrinkage in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[6] The clinical data were presented at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.[7]
2014[edit]
In March, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designation for the company's proposed therapy for DLBCL.[8]
In June, Kite Pharma entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to certain intellectual property related to TCR-based product candidates that target the NY-ESO-1 antigen for the treatment of cancers expressing NY-ESO-1.[9]
In August, Kite Pharma announced findings from its ongoing clinical trial: 12 of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies had complete remissions (8 patients) or partial remissions (4 patients) resulting in a 92% objective response rate. The results support Kite Pharma's plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fourth quarter of 2014 to initiate a clinical trial of Kite Pharma's lead CAR-based product candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with DLBCL.[10]
2015[edit]
In January, Kite Pharma and Amgen entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize the next generation of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies based on Kite's engineered autologous cell therapy platform and Amgen's extensive array of cancer targets.[11][12]
In May, Kite Pharma announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma has been treated.[13]
In June, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies.[14]
In July, Kite Pharma and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society announced that they have entered into a partnership to enhance the development of Kite's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[15]
In September, Kite Pharma announced that it has expanded its collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Kite and the NKI have entered into an agreement under which Kite will receive from the NKI the exclusive option to license multiple T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy candidates targeting solid tumors. Kite has also expanded its access to additional resources and research facilities through a master services agreement with the NKI.[16]
In October, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for intellectual property related to T cell receptor (TCR)-based product candidates directed against MAGE A3 and A3/A6 antigens for the treatment of tumors expressing MAGE, which include lung, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers, among others.[17] In the same month, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a worldwide research and license agreement with Alpine Immune Sciences (AIS), a privately held biotechnology startup, to discover and develop protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer. AIS will grant Kite an exclusive license to two programs from its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, which Kite plans to further engineer into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates. This collaboration will accelerate Kite's efforts to establish the next generation of engineered T cell therapies specifically designed to overcome the inhibitory mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironment.[18][19]
In December, Kite Pharma announced that it has initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of KTE-C19 (ZUMA-3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor designed to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[3] In the same month, Kite Pharma and GE Global Research announced they will partner to develop a next-generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T-cell therapy. Kite and GE Global Research—GE’s centralized R&D hub—said they aim to increase the availability of engineered T-cell therapies by speeding up development of automation technologies that have the potential to lower costs, operate faster, and minimize variability.[20] Also in December, Kite announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to the Company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).[4]
2016[edit]
It was announced that Kite Pharma will present at the 34th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2016.[21] Also in January, it was announced that Kite Pharma has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NCI for the research and clinical development of a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidate for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.[22] Moreover, Kite Pharma announced that its European subsidiary has entered into a research and license agreement with Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) to identify and develop T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates targeting solid tumors that are associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection.[23]
In March, Kite Pharma has announced that it would be collaborating with Genentech, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two of its novel therapies. The target population for the tests would be patients suffering from non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The therapies in question, KTE-C19 and atezolizumab, would be tested in combination with each other.[24]
In June, Kite Pharma and Cell Design Labs, Inc. announced a research collaboration and license agreement to develop next generation, precision-controlled chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) product candidates that incorporate Cell Design Labs’ molecular “on/off switch” technology.[25] Also in June, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into a new Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the research and clinical development of T-cell receptor (TCR) product candidates directed against human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers.[26]
In July, Kite Pharma announced that it has entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, on behalf of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for technology to advance the development of off-the-shelf allogeneic T-cell therapies from renewable pluripotent stem cells.[27]
In December, Kite Pharma and Vitruvian Networks, Inc., a pioneering cell and gene therapy software and analytics platform company co-founded by GE Ventures and the Mayo Clinic, announced a strategic partnership to create a software solution to support commercial availability of T-cell therapies. Together, the parties will design and develop a platform for patients, physicians and treatment centers that enables commercial-scale ordering, logistics, monitoring and delivery of autologous cell therapies if they are FDA-approved, including axicabtagene ciloleucel (formerly known as KTE-C19), Kite’s lead investigational engineered T-cell therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[28]
2017[edit]
In March, Kite announced results a clinical trial of CAR-T cells in around a hundred people with advanced Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[29]
In April, Kite has won the ‘Clinical Trial Result of the Year’ award for its CAR-T trial of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in patients with Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma at the 2017 Clinical and Research Excellence Awards.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
