Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

------------------                                                              

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

 The trust seeks to provide above average total return through dividend income
and capital appreciation.                                                       

 PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The trust seeks to provide total return, through dividend income and capital
appreciation, by investing in a portfolio consisting of the 10 stocks with the  
highest dividend yield chosen from among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones         
Industrial Average(SM) ("DJIA(SM)") as of May 13, 2011.  The stocks are         
held in approximately equal dollar amounts as of the trust's inception.         

Please note that the strategy was applied to select the portfolio at a      
particular time.  If we<F1>* create additional units of the trust after the     
trust's inception date, the trust will purchase the securities originally       
selected by applying the strategy.  This is true even if a later application of 
the strategy would have resulted in the selection of different securities.  We

 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  STOCK PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over     
time.                                                                     

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR  
 MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
in the value of your units.                                               

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY    
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.       

*  THE TRUST IS CONSIDERED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES 
  IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR.  Negative developments in this sector will affect
the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more        
diversified investment.                                                   

*  THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND TO PUBLISHED       
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY.  This can    
 happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings
of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of the trust       
offering or timing of your investment, and trust expenses.                

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,   
 the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same stocks even if
their market value declines.

The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 2.95% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.170 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning          
September 20, 2011.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.025 per    
unit and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be   
three months).                                                                  

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year              $375                                  
3 years             $944                                  
5 years           $1,539                                  
10 years          $3,153                                  

This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust    
each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.

HOW TO BUY UNITS

You can buy units of the trust on any business day the New York Stock       
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public offering  
price of units includes:                                                        

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  organization costs plus                                                  

*  the sales fee.                                                           

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all   
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock     
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized       
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly      
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive   
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the  
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by   
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then  
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer    
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It 
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the  
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may  
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.          

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this   
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service        
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value 
after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security.  We    
will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national         
securities exchange, or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.  

 We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in
this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the New   
York Stock Exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus.  On 
the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of   
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration     
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later.                                                                       

 ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the securities represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your    
trust.  These costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement   
and legal documents, federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and  
expenses of the trustee and the initial audit.  Your trust will sell securities 
to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or    
after six months, if earlier.  The value of your units will decline when the    
trust pays these costs.

P-->4877th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
TRANSACTIONAL SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.
We refer to this fee as the "transactional sales fee."  The transactional sales 
fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals 2.70% of the public 
offering price per unit based on a $10 public offering price per unit.  This    
percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on  
the trust's inception date.  The transactional sales fee equals the difference  
between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee.  As a result, 
the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the
public offering price per unit varies.  The transactional sales fee does not    
include the creation and development fee which is described under "Expenses."   

The maximum sales fee equals 2.95% of the public offering price per unit at 
the time of purchase.  You pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units. 
The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage  
(maximum of 2.95% of the public offering price per unit) and the sum of the     
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation   
and development fee.  The initial sales fee will be approximately 1.00% of the  
public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit. 
The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.170 per unit.  Your trust pays the        
deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page 3.  If you
redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee,  
you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your   
units.                                                                          

If you purchase units after the last deferred sales fee payment has been    
assessed, the secondary market sales fee is equal to 2.95% of the public        
offering price and does not include deferred payments.                          

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.  Since the deferred sales fee and the        
creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must 
charge these fees per unit regardless of any discounts.  However, if you are    
eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the  
fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development 
fee, we will credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these   
fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units.                                    

Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of   
your investment:                                                                

IF YOU PURCHASE:        YOUR FEE WILL BE:                           
------------------------------------------                            

Less than $50,000             2.95%                                   
$50,000 - $99,999             2.70                                    
$100,000 - $249,999           2.45                                    
$250,000 - $499,999           2.20                                    
$500,000 - $999,999           1.95                                    
$1,000,000 or more            1.40                                    

 We apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the
time of purchase.  We also apply the different purchase levels on a unit basis  
using a $10 unit equivalent.  For example, if you purchase between 10,000 and   
24,999 units, your fee is 2.45% of your public offering price per unit.         

You may AGGREGATE unit orders submitted by the same person for units of any 
of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one broker-dealer to qualify
for a purchase level.  You can also include these orders as your own for        
purposes of this aggregation:                                                   

*  orders submitted by your spouse or minor children living in the same     
household and

P-->4878th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
*  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.             

The discounts described above apply during the initial offering period.     

Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment   
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each 
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for         
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management 
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for 
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed.  You should    
consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these  
accounts.  To purchase units in these Fee Accounts, your financial advisor must 
purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if         
available.  Please contact your financial advisor for more information.  If     
units of the trust are purchased for a Fee Account and the units are subject to 
a Wrap Fee in such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible") then    
investors may be eligible to purchase units of the trust in these Fee Accounts  
that are not subject to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the  
creation and development fee that is retained by the sponsor.  For example, this
table illustrates the sales fee you will pay as a percentage of the initial $10 
public offering price per unit (the percentage will vary with the unit price).  

Initial sales fee                0.00%

This discount applies only during the initial offering period.  Certain Fee 
Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees on the purchase     
and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other processing           
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.  We      
reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee Accounts by        
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be  
detrimental to the trust.                                                       

Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by      
officers, directors and employees of the sponsor and its affiliates and their   
family members (spouses, children and parents).  These purchases are not subject
to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the creation and          
development fee.  We also waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made by
registered representatives of selling firms and their family members (spouses,  
children and parents).  These purchases may be made at the public offering price
per unit less the applicable regular dealer concession.  These discounts apply  
during the initial offering period and in the secondary market.  All employee   
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm.  Only        
officers, directors and employees of companies that allow their employees to    
participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.   

Rollover/Exchange Option.  We waive a portion of the sales fee on units of  
the trust offered in this prospectus if you buy your units with redemption or   
termination proceeds from any of our other unit trusts.  You may also purchase  
units of the trust offered in this prospectus at this reduced fee if you        
purchase your units with (1) termination proceeds from an unaffiliated unit     
trust or (2) redemption proceeds from an unaffiliated unit trust if such trust  
is scheduled to terminate within 30 days of the redemption.  The discounted

these transactions is equal to the regular public offering price per unit less  
1.00%.  However, if you invest redemption or termination proceeds of $500,000 or
more in units of the trust, the maximum sales fee on your units will be limited 
to the maximum sales fee for the applicable amount invested in the table under  
"Large Purchases" above.  To qualify for this discount, the termination or      
redemption proceeds used to purchase units of the trust offered in this         
prospectus must be derived from a transaction that occurred within 30 days of   
your purchase of units of the trust offered in this prospectus.  In addition,   
the discount will only be available for investors that utilize the same broker- 
dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for both the
unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the termination or
redemption proceeds used for the unit purchase.  You may be required to provide 
appropriate documentation or other information to your broker-dealer to evidence
your eligibility for this sales fee discount.                                   

Please note that if you purchase units of the trust in this manner using    
redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining        
deferred sales fee at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales   
fee remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption proceeds.   
These discounts apply only during the initial offering period.                  

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  We do not charge any sales fee when you reinvest
distributions from your trust into additional units of the trust.  This sales   
fee discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary    
market.  Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are  
fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these fees per unit       
regardless of this discount.  If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan,  
we will credit you with additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover
the amount of any remaining deferred sales fee or creation and development fee  
that will be collected on such units at the time of reinvestment.  The dollar   
value of these units will fluctuate over time.                                  

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-    
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional 
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your        
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the 
net asset value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation 
and development fee or organization costs if you sell or redeem units during the
initial offering period.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to
as the "liquidation price."  You pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you  
sell or redeem your units.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or  
other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests.                      

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and development fee
or organization costs if you sell units during the

P-->48710th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
initial offering period.  We may then resell the units to other investors at the
public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary   
market repurchase price is the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-   
dealers might also maintain a secondary market in units.  You should contact    
your financial professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best 
price available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at any time without   
notice.  Even if we do not make a market, you will be able to redeem your units 
with the trustee on any business day for the current redemption price.          

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.    
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset  
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and       
development fee or organization costs if you redeem units during the initial    
offering period.   You will pay any remaining deferred sales fee at the time you
redeem units.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if the 
trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by        
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption 
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial       
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons   
that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the  
trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price   
provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It  
is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit         
redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in 
a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a timely manner or is      
incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after 
the trustee receives your completed request.                                    

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your   
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally      
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.  The trustee
will make any in-kind distribution of securities by distributing applicable     
securities in book entry form to the account of your financial professional at  
Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole shares of the applicable      
securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.  You may not request this   
option in the last 30 days of your

trust's life.  We may discontinue this option at any time without notice.       

EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our   
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial       
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully 
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with    
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have     
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We   
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.                             

 DISTRIBUTIONS

MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net  
investment income along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution    
date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date, provided that the   
total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of the trust's net asset  
value as determined under the trust agreement.  The record and distribution     
dates are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary"       
section of this prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special      
distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  For 
example, this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction       
involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio.  The amount of your       
distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or

The issuers in the trust's portfolio make dividend payments at various times
during the year.  When the trust receives dividends from issuers, the trustee   
credits the dividends to the trust's accounts.  Because the trust does not      
necessarily receive dividends from the underlying issuers at a constant rate    
throughout the year, the trust's income distributions to unitholders will       
fluctuate from month to month.                                                  

ESTIMATED ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual distributions are 
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  We generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive 
on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer (or      
adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign 
issuers) or on scheduled income payments.  However, dividend conventions for    
certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in  
the United States and in certain instances, dividends paid or declared over     
several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions.  Due 
to this and various other factors, actual income payments received by the trust 
will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled  
income payments.  The actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary
with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in income payments received and  
with the sale of securities.  The estimated net annual distributions for        
subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the   
first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio  
will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs, the creation  
and development fee and the deferred sales fee.                                 

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement

showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution.  Each    
year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trust's activity and
certain tax information.  You can request copies of security evaluations to     
enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your 
trust, if available.                                                            

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.  

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to various factors.  These 
can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a  
security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even   
though we supervise your portfolio, you should remember that we do not manage   
your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a security solely because the market  
value falls as is possible in a managed fund.                                   

DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling 
or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent ownership interests in 
the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.  Common stockholders have a 
right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of   
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  Common stocks do not    
assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's 
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.           

STRATEGY CORRELATION RISK is the risk that the trust's performance will not 
sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trust's        
investment strategy.  This can happen for reasons such as:                      

*  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact
weightings at a given time,                                           

 *  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may
 be created at various times during the year and generally have 15 month
terms,                                                                

*  the trust may not be fully invested at all times, and                    

*  trust fees and expenses.                                                 

CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more         
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry  
because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry.  A        
portfolio "concentrates" in an industry when stocks in a particular industry    
make up 25% or more of the portfolio.                                           

 The trust invests primarily in stocks of HEALTH CARE COMPANIES.  Companies in
the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of their        
products and services, a factor which could have a significant and possibly     
unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services.  
Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new    
products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent protection for  
drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances

will render their products obsolete.  The research and development costs of     
bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental     
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.   
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for      
several years.  Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new     
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may be affected by events  
and conditions including, among other things, demand for services, the ability  
of the facility to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the 
facility, management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by 
insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing     
state rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and      
possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or         
restriction of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with
Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.                

LEGISLATION/LITIGATION.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives 
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain of the companies represented in the trust.  In addition, litigation     
regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented 
by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities.  No
one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on   
the share prices of the securities.                                             

LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security.                                     

NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank 
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

The following table compares hypothetical performance information for the   
strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the DJIA(SM) in    
each of the years listed below (and as of the most recent month).  These        
hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the    
trust.  Returns from the trust will differ from the hypothetical strategy       
returns for several reasons, such as:                                           

 *  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on
the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur;                   

*  strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent     
month), while trusts begin and end on various dates;                  

*  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year;                     

  *  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in all
stocks comprising its strategy; and                                   

 *  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the
closing prices used in buying and selling units.                      

You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any 
index, and it is not expected that it will do so.  In fact, the trust's strategy
underperformed its comparative index in certain years and we cannot guarantee   
that the trust will outperform its related index

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Past performance of the
strategy stocks is hypothetical (not any actual trust), is shown for            
illustrative purposes only and is not intended to indicate the future           
performance of any investment, including the trust.  The strategy stocks for a  
given year consist of the common stocks selected by applying the strategy as of 
the beginning of the period (and not the date the trust actually sells units).  
Total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group of  
stocks between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total        
dividends paid on each group of stocks during such period divided by the opening
market value of each group of stocks as of the first trading day of a period.   
Total return figures assume that all dividends are reinvested semi-annually.    
Strategy figures reflect the deduction of sales charges and expenses but have   
not been reduced by estimated brokerage commissions paid by the trust in        
acquiring securities or any taxes incurred by investors.                        

The trust's strategy begins with the DJIA(SM).  The DJIA(SM) consists of 30 
U.S. stocks chosen by the editors of The Wall Street Journal as being           
representative of the broad market and of American industry.  Changes in the    
component stocks of the DJIA(SM) are made entirely by the editors of The Wall   
Street Journal without consulting the companies, the stock exchange or any      
official agency.  For the sake of continuity, changes are made rarely.

 HOW THE TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and    
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities   
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of                       

14     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->48716th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
your trust to us.  Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of  
your trust.  These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust  
terminates.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's         
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units and fractional interest of each 
unit in the trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.    

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will   
generally buy and sell securities:                                              

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,                           

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been  
made for a security or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been    
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or     
accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the    
best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to 
unitholders.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will      
either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities  
or property and distribute the proceeds.                                        

We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create   
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio.  When your  
trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You     
could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and        
fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time   
your trust buys the securities.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we   
may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers   
that sell units or are affiliated with us, your trust or the trustee.           

 Pursuant to an exemptive order, your trust may be able to purchase securities
from other trusts that we sponsor when we create additional units.  Your trust  
may also be able to sell securities to other trusts that we sponsor to satisfy  
unit redemption, pay deferred sales charges or expenses, in connection with     
periodic tax compliance or in connection with the termination of your trust.    
The exemption may enable each trust to eliminate commission costs on these      
transactions.  The price for those securities will be the closing price on the  
sale date on the exchange where the securities are principally traded as        
certified by us to the trustee.                                                 

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect 
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change 
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.      
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this  
agreement.                                                                      

 TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of  
this prospectus.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the
trust is less than 40% of the

original value of the securities in the trust at the time of deposit.  At this  
size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on your investment. 
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may also vote to         
terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate the trust in the event   
that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for   
redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than 40% 
of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.  If
this happens, we will refund any sales charge that you paid.                    

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to   
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other       
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, 
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using 
the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a registered  
broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of FINRA and Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities      
Rulemaking Board (MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor 
or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust  
without a sponsor, or terminate your trust.                                     

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in  
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or  
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and       
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in  
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for  
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and   
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a         
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports  
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an     
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the      
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have 
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or        
director for the issuers of the securities.                                     

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust.  Its
principal unit investment trust division office is located at 2 Hanson Place,   
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling   
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its  
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some    
cases without your

consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and investors.            

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  During the initial offering period, the distribution fee (the 
broker-dealer concession or agency commission) for broker-dealers and other     
firms is as follows:                                                            

TRANSACTION             CONCESSION OR                             
AMOUNT:             AGENCY COMMISSION:                        
------------------------------------------

$50,000 - $99,999             2.00                                    
$100,000 - $249,999           1.75

We apply these concessions or agency commissions as a percent of the public 
offering price per unit at the time of the transaction.  We also apply the      
different levels on a unit basis using a $10 unit equivalent.  The broker-dealer
concession or agency commission is 65% of the sales fee for secondary market    
sales.  For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts  
who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase units of the trust,
the distribution fee is 1.30% of the public offering price per unit.  No        
distribution fee is paid to broker-dealers or other selling firms in connection 
with unit sales in Fee Accounts subject to a Wrap Fee.  In addition to the      
foregoing, we will pay UBS an additional concession within a reasonable time    
following the initial offering period equal to 0.15% of the public offering     
price per unit sold by UBS during the initial offering period, excluding units  
sold to Fee Accounts subject to a Wrap Fee.                                     

Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit investment   
trusts for which AAM acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional         
compensation for volume sales.  The sponsor offers two separate volume          
concession structures for certain trusts that are referred to as "Volume        
Concession A" and "Volume Concession B."  The trust offered in this prospectus  
is a Volume Concession A trust.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units 
of any Volume Concession A trust are eligible to receive the additional         
compensation described below.  Such payments will be in addition to the regular 
concessions paid to firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus.    
The additional concession is based on total initial offering period sales of all
Volume Concession A trusts during a calendar quarter as set forth in the        
following table:

This volume concession will be paid on units of all Volume Concession A     
trusts sold in the initial offering period, except as described below.  For a   
trust to be eligible for this additional Volume Concession A compensation for   
calendar quarter sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related  
to this additional Volume Concession A compensation; a trust is not eligible for
this additional Volume Concession A compensation                                

                                            Understanding Your Investment     17

if the prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure related to this    
additional Volume Concession A compensation.  Broker-dealer firms will not      
receive additional compensation unless they sell at least $5.0 million of units 
of Volume Concession A trusts during a calendar quarter.  For example, if a firm
sells $4.5 million of units of Volume Concession A trusts in the initial        
offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will not receive any        
additional compensation with respect to such trusts.  Once a firm reaches a     
particular breakpoint during a quarter, the firm will receive the stated volume 
concession on all initial offering period sales of Volume Concession A trusts   
during the applicable quarter.  For example, if a firm sells $7.5 million of    
units of Volume Concession A trusts in the initial offering period during a     
calendar quarter, the firm will receive additional compensation of 0.05% of $7.5
million and if a firm sells $12.5 million of units of Volume Concession A trusts
in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive 
additional compensation of 0.075% of $12.5 million.                             

In addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge.  However, such     
sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level    
breakpoints for volume concessions.  Secondary market sales of all unit trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions.  We will pay these       
amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time following each calendar  
quarter.                                                                        

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the distribution fee.  We reserve the right to change the amount of concessions 
or agency commissions from time to time.                                        

We currently provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,        
additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this   
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in       
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales.  A number of factors are considered in determining     
whether to pay these additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not 
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the     
level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its     
agents, the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list  
and access to an intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for      
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to,      
expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising,  
sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of 
unit sales among an intermediary's representations or offices, obtaining shelf  
space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale
of our products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of            
intermediaries that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or
on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the
purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or          
purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional 
compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described   
above, some of which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an   
incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our
products, including this trust, over other products.  These arrangements will   
not change the price you pay for your units.                                    

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for

sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not constitute an offer of   
units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully.   
We may reject any order for units in whole or in part.                          

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to      
create units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of       
securities into the trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio."
 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

 This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any   
conclusions set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked  
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income  
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be      
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

ASSETS OF THE TRUST.  The trust is expected to hold shares of stock in      
corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated as equity for federal income tax   
purposes.  It is possible that the trust will also hold other assets, including 
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those  
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section.  All of the   
assets held by the trust constitute the "Trust Assets."  Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets and
thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal 
income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.                                       

TRUST STATUS.  If the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the 
documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes.  As a unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata      
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any) 
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets.  This is true even if you elect to have 
your distributions reinvested into additional units.  In addition, the income   
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax        
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses. 
Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from   
the trust may also be subject to a new 3.8 percent "medicare tax"  imposed for  
taxable years beginning after 2012.  This tax

will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income
exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married    
couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.    

YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION.  If your trust disposes 
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss.  If you dispose of  
your units or redeem your units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss.  To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your  
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction.  You can generally determine your initial tax basis
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your units, including sales     
charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date   
you acquire your units.  In certain circumstances, however, you may have to     
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units (for example, in the case of 
certain dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits, 
as discussed below).                                                            

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net     
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 0% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets).  These capital gains rates are generally effective for       
taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013.  For later periods, if you are  
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is    
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).  The 
20% rate is reduced to 18% for net capital gains from most property acquired    
after December 31, 2000 with a holding period of more than five years, and the  
10% rate is reduced to 8% for net capital gains from most property (regardless  
of when acquired) with a holding period of more than five years.                

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

 DIVIDENDS FROM STOCKS.  Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013.              

 DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  Generally, a domestic corporation owning units
in a trust may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to 
such unit owner's pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the
trust.  However, a corporation generally will not be entitled to the dividends  
received deduction with respect to dividends from most foreign corporations.    

IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances as described in this    
prospectus, you may request an In-Kind Distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your units or at your trust's termination.  By electing to receive an In-
Kind Distribution, you will receive Trust Assets plus, possibly, cash.  You will
not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in exchange   
for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust Assets held 
by your trust.

However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional 
portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the
difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such    
Trust Asset or fractional portion.                                              

ROLLOVERS AND EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust
rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax 
purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any    
loss will be treated as a capital loss.  However, any loss you incur in         
connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of the next  
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Generally, for federal 
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses.  You 
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense.  You may be required to treat some  
or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.      
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

FOREIGN INVESTORS, TAXES AND INVESTMENTS.  Distributions by your trust that 
are treated as U.S. source income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of        
domestic corporations) will generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and    
withholding in the case of Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign 
corporations or other non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty.  If   
you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or      
resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be   
subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some or   
all of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of 
your Units, provided that certain conditions are met.  You should consult your  
tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt  
for U.S. tax purposes.  Distributions after December 31, 2012 may be subject to 
a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-  
U.S. financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the    
U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and (ii) certain other
non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications and information    
about the entity's U.S. owners.  You should also consult your tax advisor with  
respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.               

 Some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.  Under the grantor  
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign 
taxes that are paid.  Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.                        

If any U.S. investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly 10 percent 
or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and 
all U.S. shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than 50 percent 
of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation, the foreign corporation  
may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).  If you own 10 percent
or more of a CFC (through the trust and in combination with your other          
investments) you

will be required to include certain types of the CFC's income in your taxable   
income for federal income tax purposes whether or not such income is distributed
to the trust or to you.                                                         

A foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign        
investment company (PFIC) if 75 percent or more of its income is passive income 
or if 50 percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive income.  If  
the trust purchases shares in a PFIC, you may be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the disposition of   
such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any gain may be    
recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the lower net       
capital gains tax rate.  Additional charges in the nature of interest may also  
be imposed on you.  Certain elections may be available with respect to PFICs    
that would limit these consequences.  However, these elections would require you
to include certain income of the PFIC in your taxable income even if not        
distributed to the trust or to you, or require you to annually recognize as     
ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the PFIC, thus       
requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in excess of  
your actual distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC     
stock during a particular year.  Dividends paid by PFICs will not be eligible to
be taxed at the net capital gains tax rate.                                     

NEW YORK TAX STATUS.  Under the existing income tax laws of the State and   
City of New York, your trust will not be taxed as a corporation subject to the  
New York state franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax.  You 
should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local     
taxation with respect to your units.                                            

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

The sponsor will receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing  
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions.  This "creation and     
development fee" is a charge of $0.025 per unit.  The trustee will deduct this  
amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. 
No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as 
compensation for sales efforts.  This fee will not be deducted from proceeds    
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before the close of 
the initial public offering period.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.               

Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),      
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking

action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the sponsor,
legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs incurred 
to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.  Your trust 
will pay a license fee for the use of certain service marks, trademarks and/or  
trade names of Dow Jones.  Your trust may pay the costs of updating its         
registration statement each year.  The trustee will generally pay trust expenses
from distributions received on the securities but in some cases may sell        
securities to pay trust expenses.

ADVISORS DISCIPLINED TRUST 701                                                  

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including    
the trust portfolio on page 4, of Advisors Disciplined Trust 701, as of         
May 17, 2011, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial          
condition is the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is  
to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our     
audit.                                                                          

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public      
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require    
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  The     
trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its   
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit        
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over 
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also   
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as       
evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation.  Our      
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of  
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities
as shown in the statement of financial condition as of May 17, 2011.  We        
believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined
Trust 701 as of May 17, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles          
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the closing sale price                                 
     evaluations as determined by the evaluator.                                                         
(2)  Cash or an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited with the trustee                         
     covering the funds (aggregating $200,000) necessary for the purchase of                             
     securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.                                          
(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to                           
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing and offering                         
     the trust.  These costs have been estimated at $0.05 per unit for the                               
     trust.  A distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the                           
     initial offering period or six months following the trust's inception date                          
     to an account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation of the                           
     investors will be satisfied.  To the extent the actual organization costs                           
     are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization                              
     costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the sponsor                          
     and deducted from the assets of the trust.                                                          
(4)  The total sales fee consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee                          
     and a creation & development fee.  The initial sales fee is equal to the                            
     difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining                               
     deferred sales fee and the total creation & development fee.  On the                                
     inception date, the total sales fee is 2.95% of the public offering price                           
     per unit.  The deferred sales fee is equal to $0.170 per unit and the                               
     creation & development fee is equal to $0.025 per unit.                                             
(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming                          
     no reduction of sales fees.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset  
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).                                                            

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's 
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units, fractional interest of each    
unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or   
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of 
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with           
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued 
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,  
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the    
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be     
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities  
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts, which  
will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the       
securities in such trust.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each 
unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each     
security.  If the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities,      
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a 
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of  
the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the          
securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.        

The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities   
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the     
trust portfolio.                                                                

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any   
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions 
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.      
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure  
in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase of any 
of the securities initially

deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless substantially all of the    
moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute    
securities in accordance with the trust agreement, refund the cash and sales fee
attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution
date.                                                                           

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

The trust seeks to provide total return, through dividend income and  
capital appreciation, by investing in a portfolio consisting of the 10 stocks   
with the highest dividend yield chosen from among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average(SM) ("DJIA(SM)") as of the trust's selection date.  There is,
of course, no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective.  The         
prospectus provides additional information regarding the trust's objective and  
investment strategy.                                                            

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in special circumstances as provided in the  
trust agreement.  Thus, the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged   
under normal circumstances.  The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may  
(but need not) direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events    
such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding    
obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other  
such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention
of such securities would be detrimental to the trust.  If a public tender offer 
has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced      
affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or accept a      
tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in
the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any excess cash  
proceeds to unitholders.  Pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited      
exceptions, the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in 
exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or   
other transaction.  If offered such new or exchanged securities or property     
other than cash, trustee shall generally reject the offer.  However, in the     
event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust, they   
may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in
a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor.                               

     The trustee may sell securities, designated by the supervisor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.                                                            

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital     
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.

P-->48730th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the
proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be    
reinvested, no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of
time its present size and composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee     
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.  
In the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a 
trust under a contract ("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under   
the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities           
("Replacement Securities") to make up the original corpus of such trust.        

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The Replacement Securities must be equity securities of 
the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income
tax status of the trust.  Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for a     
trust, the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition 
of the Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date    
which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the      
amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded  
the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are
acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust,  
i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market     
variations to improve a unitholder's investment.                                

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
cash attributable to such Failed Securities not more than 30 days after the date
on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a Replacement         
Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that, at the time of receipt
of such cash, they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities
at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have  
earned for unitholders of such trust.                                           

  In the event that a Replacement Security is not acquired by a trust, the
income for such trust may be reduced.                                           

   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be    
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

  MARKET RISK.  Because the trust invests in stocks, you should understand
the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units.  These risks include  
the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of
the stock market may worsen and the value                                       

 -4-

P-->48731st�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
of the stocks (and therefore units) will fall.  Stocks are especially           
susceptible to general stock market movements.  The value of stocks often rises 
or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of      
companies change.  These perceptions are based on factors including expectations
regarding government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic     
expansion or contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises.    
The value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and 
may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units.  As with 
any investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be   
positive over any period of time.  Because the trust is unmanaged, the Trustee  
will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed 
investments.  In addition, because some trusts hold a relatively small number of
stocks, you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified        
investment.                                                                     

   DIVIDENDS.  Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company.  Common stockholders have a right to receive        
payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors,       
bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company.  This means that common   
stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of     
directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  If a company issues     
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities   
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common     
stock was issued first.  As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.                                   

HEALTH CARE ISSUERS. The trust may invest significantly in health care
companies.  Healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and       
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health        
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field.  These companies are subject to governmental regulation of    
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and        
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or   
services.  Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition  
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent        
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological  
advances will render their products obsolete.  The research and development     
costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy         
governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come 
to market.  Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain       
products for several years.  Such companies may also have persistent losses     
during a new product's transition from development to production, and revenue   
patterns may be erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may be     
affected by events and conditions including, among other things, demand for     
services, the ability of the facility to provide the services required,         
physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition    
with other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit    
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,          
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice      
insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial          
assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar 
third-party payor programs.

   Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time.  These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and  
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of
healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare         
insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans.  The sponsor is   
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the      
issuers of securities in your trust.                                            

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase
of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and
other acquisition costs.                                                        

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

  DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account for the trust.  All other receipts are        
credited by the trustee to a separate Capital Account for the trust.  The       
trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each         
distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the         
preceding record date.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal  
to their pro rata share of the available balance of the Income Account of the   
trust.  All distributions will be net of applicable expenses.  There is no      
assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends        
received may be used to pay expenses.  In addition, excess amounts from the     
Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed on each distribution    
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record     
date.  The trustee is not required to make a distribution from the Income       
Account or the Capital Account unless the total cash held for distribution      
equals at least 0.1% of the trust's net asset value as determined under the     
trust agreement.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the          
securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will
be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next distribution  
date applicable to the Capital Account.  The trustee shall be required to make a
distribution from the Capital Account if the cash balance on deposit therein    
available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least $1.00 per 
unit.  The trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Capital 
or Income Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits 
from the use of such funds).                                                    

    The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an   
amount substantially equal to the unitholders' pro rata share of the available  
balance of the Income Account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses.  
Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the 
year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate.  Persons who 
purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person     
becomes a record owner.  A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a 
unitholder of record, on the date

of settlement provided payment has been received.  Notification to the trustee  
of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser, but in the     
normal course of business the selling broker-dealer provides such notice.       

 The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account of
a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust.  The trustee also   
may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to  
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust.        
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trust's assets until   
such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate accounts.  In addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and
Capital Accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover           
redemptions of units.                                                           

 DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT.  Unitholders may reinvest distributions into
additional units of their trust without a sales fee.  Your trust will pay any   
deferred sales fee and creation and development fee per unit regardless of any  
sales fee discounts.  However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such   
that the sales fee you must pay is less than the applicable deferred sales fee  
and creation and development fee, you will be credited the difference between   
your sales fee and the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee  
at the time you buy your units.  Accordingly, if you reinvest distributions into
additional units of your trust, you will be credited the amount of any remaining
deferred sales fee and creation and development fee on such units at the time of
reinvestment.                                                                   

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Income Account:                                        

          (1)  the amount of income received on the securities (including income
         received as a portion of the proceeds of any disposition of
securities);                                      

        (2)  the amounts paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
     purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any, and for redemptions;           

         (3)  the deductions, if any, from the Income Account for payment into
the Reserve Account;

       (5)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for
              purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or
         for purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust

  (6)  the deductions for payment of the depositor's expenses of
      maintaining the registration of the trust units, if any;

(7)  the aggregate distributions to unitholders; and        

       (8)  the balance remaining after such deductions and distributions,

            liquidation or disposition of any of the securities, excluding
 any portion thereof credited to the Income Account;

       (2)  the amount paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
     purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any, and for redemptions;

into the Reserve Account;                         

    (4)  the deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and
        expenses of the trustee, the depositor, the evaluator, the
              supervisor, counsel, auditors and any other expenses paid by the
trust;                                            

  (5)  the deductions for payment of the depositor's expenses of
organizing the trust;

              purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or

       (10) the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
            expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount
            per unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar
year; and                                         

(C)  the following information:                                       

          (1)  a list of the securities held as of the last business day of such

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as 
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has 
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of    
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association  
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not   
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States   
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be      
amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as
(1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the  
acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the       
schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the   
holders of which are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The    
trust agreement may not be amended so                                           

 -9-

P-->48736th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
as to reduce the interest in a trust represented by units without the consent of
all affected unitholders.  Except for the amendments, changes or modifications  
described above, neither the sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other   
amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without the giving of  
notice and the obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing 
at least 66 2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No       
amendment may reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are 
required to consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust       
agreement without the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then       
outstanding of the affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made     
which would (1) alter the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2)  
provide the trustee with the power to engage in business or investment          
activities other than as specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3)      
adversely affect the tax status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or 
result in the units being deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax 
purposes or (4) unless the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated         
investment company for federal income tax purposes, result in a variation of the
investment of unitholders in the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of 
the substance of any such amendment.                                            

The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held 
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination 
date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the applicable minimum value  
stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total value of securities        
deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), the trustee may, in 
its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.
A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units representing 66   
2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.  In addition, the sponsor may       
terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer 
maintained.  A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a      
sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than
40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.
If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the       
sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee
paid by such purchaser.                                                         

 Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the scheduled
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all 
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection   
with the termination of the trust.  The sponsor may assist the trustee in these 
sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law.  The  
sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales.     

   The sponsor will generally instruct the trustee to sell the securities as
quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its        
judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but 
it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of      
within a reasonable time after a trust's termination.  The sponsor does not     
anticipate that the period will be longer than one month, and it could be as    
short as one day, depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold.  The 
liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security   
and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day.   
Of course, no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities   
will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings.              

-10-

P-->48737th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
     Approximately thirty days prior to termination of a trust, the trustee will
notify unitholders of the termination and provide a form allowing qualifying    
unitholders to elect an in-kind distribution.  A unitholder who owns the minimum
number of units described in the prospectus may request an in-kind distribution 
from the trustee instead of cash.  The trustee will make an in-kind distribution
through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry   
form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository     
Trust Company.  The unitholder will be entitled to receive whole shares of each 
of the securities comprising the portfolio of a trust and cash from the Capital 
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the unitholder is entitled.  The
trustee may adjust the number of shares of any security included in a           
unitholder's in-kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
shares.  The sponsor may terminate the in-kind distribution option at any time  
upon notice to the unitholders.  Special federal income tax consequences will   
result if a unitholder requests an in-kind distribution.                        

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata    
share of the balances remaining in the Income and Capital Accounts of the trust.

The sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a   
subsequent series of a trust at approximately the time of the mandatory         
termination date.  If the sponsor does offer such units for sale, unitholders   
may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price  
that includes a reduced sales fee.  There is, however, no assurance that units  
of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at that time, or if       
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the     
requests of any or all unitholders.                                             

   THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York.  The Bank of New York Mellon has its      
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468.  The Bank of New York Mellon is       
subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the    
State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and 
its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the    
extent permitted by law.                                                        

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.

P-->48738th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The 
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a     
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after        
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent            
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the       
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or    
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the      
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in  
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any  
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for the  
trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the sponsor, 
or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred either (1) a 
material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or (2) one or more
grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect to a trust, the  
sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the trustee and      
appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written instrument, in 
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and   
one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution of a written       
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,       
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the        
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the   
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise  
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided  
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

   THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
acting through its unit investment trust division.  The sponsor is a broker-    
dealer specializing in providing services to broker-dealers, registered         
representatives, investment advisers and other financial professionals.  The    
sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, Monument, Colorado
80132.  You can contact the unit investment trust division at 8100 East 22nd    
Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using the contacts   
listed on the back cover of the prospectus.  The sponsor is a registered broker-
dealer and investment adviser and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation      
(SIPC), and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).   

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of

reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the

trust agreement and liquidate any trust as provided therein, or (c) continue to 
act as trustee without terminating the trust agreement.                         

THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the   
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor 
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor  
or trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by 
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has 
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the        
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of 
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be    
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                                       

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or        
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale  
of any securities.                                                              

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided, 
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or       
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross           
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its   
obligations under the trust agreement.                                          

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

   The sponsor may receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial                                    

-13-

P-->48740th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
functions.  The amount of this "creation and development fee" is set forth in   
the prospectus.  The trustee will deduct this amount from your trust's assets as
of the close of the initial offering period.  No portion of this fee is applied 
to the payment of distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts.   
This fee will not be deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase,         
redemption or exchange of units before the close of the initial public offering 
period.                                                                         

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing   
and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part of the 
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from   
the use of these funds.                                                         

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor   
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate  
cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the 
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any  
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based  
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                              

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as    
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the     
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during  
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at   
the end of each month.                                                          

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when 
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the  
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate  
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,   
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units    
outstanding at the end of each month.                                           

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Income Account of the related trust to the extent funds are   
available and then from the Capital Account.  Each such fee (other than any     
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders  
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon         
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable   
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the     
trust.  If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to  
provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell     
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or     
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration  
statement each year.                                                            

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION                                 

When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the   
securities in the trust may be altered.  In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the sponsor to specify minimum amounts in which  
blocks of securities are to be sold.  In effecting purchases and sales of a     
trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct that orders be placed with 
and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be    
affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or dealers participating in the offering 
of units.                                                                       

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  The public offering price per unit is equal to the net asset    
value per unit plus organization costs plus the applicable sales fee referred to
in the prospectus.  The initial sales fee is equal to the difference between the
maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the total 
creation and development fee.  The sales fee as a percentage of the public      
offering price and the net amount invested is set forth in the prospectus.  The 
deferred sales fee is a fixed dollar amount and will be collected in            
installments as described in the prospectus.  The creation and development fee  
is a fixed dollar amount and will be collected at the end of the initial        
offering period as described in the prospectus.  Units purchased after the      
initial deferred sales fee payment will be subject to the remaining deferred    
sales fee payments.  Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire    
applicable deferred sales fee has been collected will be assessed the remaining 
deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  Units sold or       
redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable creation and development   
fee has been collected will not be assessed the remaining creation and          
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  During the initial     
offering period, a portion of the public offering price includes an amount of   
securities to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a  
trust.  These costs                                                             

-15-

P-->48742nd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
include the cost of preparing the registration statement, the trust indenture   
and other closing documents, registering units with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and states, the initial audit of the trust portfolio, legal fees and 
the initial fees and expenses of the trustee.  These costs will be deducted from
a trust as of the end of the initial offering period or after six months, if    
earlier.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing    
unit purchases.                                                                 

As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the 
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of     
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation 
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of 
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised     
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and  
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such       
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   
each such day as discussed in the prospectus.  Orders received by the trustee,  
sponsor or authorized financial professionals for purchases, sales or           
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is    
closed, will be held until the next determination of price as discussed in the  
prospectus.                                                                     

  Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering    
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus. 
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or  
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of 
the underlying securities.  Net asset value per unit is determined by dividing  
the value of a trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities, by the total number of units outstanding.  The portfolio securities
are valued by the evaluator as follows: If the security is listed on a national 
securities exchange, the evaluation will generally be based on the last sale    
price on the exchange (unless the evaluator deems the price inappropriate as a  
basis for evaluation).  If the security is not so listed or, if so listed and   
the principal market for the security is other than on the exchange, the        
evaluation will generally be made by the evaluator in good faith based on an    
appraisal of the fair value of the securities using recognized pricing methods. 

     The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing 
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made 
during the preceding 24-hour period.                                            

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934.                                                           

-16-

P-->48743rd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.  and through others.    
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial   
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The 
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in       
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional 
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products.  These arrangements will not  
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In 
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the         
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the 
cost of such securities to a trust.  The sponsor may also realize profits or    
losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from 
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or   
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or  
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such          
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of     
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said    
units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator, provided that the     
repurchase price will not be reduced by any remaining creation and development  
fee or organization costs during the initial offering period.  While the sponsor
may repurchase units from time to time, it does not currently intend to maintain
an active secondary market for units.  Unitholders who wish to dispose of their 
units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to    
determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption   
price and, if so, the amount thereof.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units     
prior to such time as the entire deferred sales fee on such units has been      
collected will be assessed the amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the
time of such sale or redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to 
such time as the entire creation and development fee on such units has been     
collected will not be assessed the amount of the remaining creation and         
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  The offering price of  
any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the    
currently effective prospectus describing                                       

-17-

P-->48744th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
such units.  Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will    
belong to the sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market,  
it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of  
units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.                            

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office.    
Unitholders must sign the request exactly as their names appear on the records  
of the trustee.  Additional documentation may be requested, and a signature     
guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors, administrators,     
trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be guaranteed by a    
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or    
such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in substitution for,   
STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.                                       

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the     
entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the 
amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or          
redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the     
entire creation and development fee on such units has been collected will not be
assessed the amount of the remaining creation and development fee at the time of
such sale or redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee   
for processing redemption requests.                                             

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances, the  
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Income Account of a trust to  
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Capital Account for a trust.             

  Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request a distribution in
kind (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash redemption of  
an amount and value of securities per unit equal to the redemption price per    
unit as determined as of the evaluation time next following the tender, provided
that the tendering unitholder meets the requirements stated in                  

-18-

P-->48745th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�45th
the prospectus and the unitholder has elected to redeem at least thirty days    
prior to the termination of the trust.  If the unitholder meets these           
requirements, a Distribution In Kind will be made by the trustee through the    
distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry form to the   
account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company.  
The tendering unitholder shall be entitled to receive whole shares of each of   
the securities comprising the portfolio of the trust and cash from the Capital  
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the tendering unitholder is     
entitled.  The trustee shall make any adjustments necessary to reflect          
differences between the redemption price of the units and the value of the      
securities distributed in kind as of the date of tender.  If funds in the       
Capital Account are insufficient to cover the required cash distribution to the 
tendering unitholder, the trustee may sell securities.  The in kind redemption  
option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time.                            

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold  
or redeemed in-kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust  
may be, reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately
the same proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a    
time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices 
than might otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be    
more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of   
the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                      

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.                                            

COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units of each
trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation time stated in the      
prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for redemption and on   
any other business day desired by it, by:                                       

A.   Adding: (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the 
     trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such securities
and (2) the aggregate value of                                        

-19-

P-->48746th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
each issue of the securities held in the trust as determined by the   
evaluator as described above;                                         

B.   Deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
   Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses, including
  but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee (including legal and
  auditing fees), the evaluator, the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash
     held for distribution to unitholders of record as of the business day prior
 to the evaluation being made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the
trust, provided that the redemption price will not be reduced by any  
 remaining creation and development fee or organization costs during the
initial offering period; and                                          

C.   Finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust will lower the  
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts.  Fees and charges with respect 
to such plans may vary.                                                         

OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates.  Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any       
multiple thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement.  Fractions of  
units, if any, will be computed to three decimal places.                        

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

    Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the prospectus,
as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included from time to 
time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information on the      
performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may be     
included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and may
reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may also
be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund        
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services  
Inc.  (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates         
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund 
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies     
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of  
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index  
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock          
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial

INVESTMENT SUMMARY





INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the
trust will achieve its objective.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing in a diversified
portfolio of common stocks of companies involved in the health care sector.
Eugene E. Peroni, Jr. selected the trust's portfolio through the application of
his proprietary method of technical analysis, the Peroni Method, and
consideration of investment opportunities under the health care theme.  In an
effort to reduce risks associated with volatile foreign economies, securities
markets and currencies, Mr. Peroni focused on U.S.-based companies, including
companies with multinational business exposure, but also considered U.S.-traded
stocks of foreign companies for inclusion in the portfolio.  Companies within
the health care sector include companies involved in biotechnology, medical
devices technology, pharmaceuticals, surgical supplies and testing activities.


The Peroni Method is a bottom-up approach to stock selection that is
primarily based on technical analysis.  The methodology examines a stock's price
architecture, accumulation and distribution trends and relative strength
patterns, among other more subtle trading characteristics.  This information is
partly gathered and analyzed through hand drawn point and figure charts which
have been a part of the methodology for over half a century.  While the Peroni
Method is primarily focused on the technical characteristics of individual
stocks, economic, monetary, geopolitical and sentiment factors at play in the
market place are also incorporated to identify leading stocks and sectors.


Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis, which generally
involves financial scrutiny of the issuing company and considers such factors as
earnings projections, P/E ratios, cash flow and other balance sheet data.  The
Peroni Method may be an investment alternative to fundamental analysis.


Mr. Peroni uses the Peroni Method to select stocks that he believes are best
able to provide capital appreciation.  He believes that technical factors can
help identify industry sector relative strength patterns that may play an
important role in investment success.  The methodology allows an unconstrained
approach to stock selection, spanning all market caps and investment styles,

i.e. growth and value.


Additional information regarding Mr. Peroni's stock selection using the
Peroni Method is described under "Understanding Your Investment--The Peroni
Method."



PRINCIPAL RISKS



As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:


*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
time.


*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.


*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
in the value of your units.


*  THE TRUST IS CONSIDERED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES
IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR.  Negative developments in this sector will
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more
diversified investment.


*  THE PERONI METHOD MAY NOT IDENTIFY STOCKS THAT WILL SATISFY THE TRUST'S
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.


*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
publicly available information.


*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
circumstances, the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same
securities even if their market value declines.




<F1>*  "AAM," "we" and related terms mean Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
trust sponsor, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise.


2     Investment Summary






WHO SHOULD INVEST



You should consider this investment if you want:


*  to own a defined portfolio of stocks of companies involved in aspects of
the health care sector selected based on technical analysis (rather than
fundamental analysis).


*  the potential for capital appreciation.


You should not consider this investment if you:


*  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
stocks selected based on technical analysis (rather than fundamental
analysis).


*  are uncomfortable investing in stocks of companies involved in aspects of
the health care sector.


*  seek current income or capital preservation.

The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 3.95% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.245 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning
September 20, 2016.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per
unit and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).



EXAMPLE



This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:


1 year                           $462
2 years (life of trust)          $492


These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $148,039 and $0,
     respectively.

(3)  This is a security issued by a foreign.

     Common stocks comprise approximately 100.00% of the investments in the
     trust, broken down by country of organization as set forth below:

          Ireland             6.03%
          United Kingdom      1.97%

longer-term investments.  Mr. Peroni regularly appears on CNBC, CBS MarketWatch,
PBS Nightly Business Report, Fox Business News and Bloomberg Radio, and has been
quoted in publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times,
U.S. News and World Report and Investors Business Daily.


Mr. Peroni began training in the field of technical research at age 16 with
his father, Eugene E. Peroni, Sr., who founded the Peroni Method more than
50 years ago.  Mr. Peroni has more than 39 years of experience in his field.
The Peroni Method uses a bottom-up approach, primarily emphasizing the technical
merits of individual stocks.


Mr. Peroni has a library of approximately 1,000 hand-charted stocks that is
the result of extensive technical research and is regularly refreshed to include
new opportunities gleaned through ticker tape analysis, news outlets, corporate
developments and practical observations.  Charts with attractive price
architecture are noted and stocks are ranked and screened on a regular basis.
Historical characteristics are analyzed for price and volume shifts and
evaluations are made using money flow and relative strength trends.  Sector
relative strength is then determined by unbiased groupings of attractive
stocks.  Portfolio construction progresses as weightings are determined by
analyzing individual stock price behavior, economic factors, monetary trends,
psychological oscillators and investor psychology.  Those stocks with the best
technical characteristics in strong or emerging leadership sectors are
candidates for inclusion in the portfolio while also taking into consideration
appropriate diversification.


The Peroni Method examines numerous technical, psychological and fundamental
data.  The data may include:


*  a stock's historical price architecture


*  net money flow trends in individual stocks


*  the relative behavior of a stock's price performance compared to other
stocks in the same sector


*  sentiment readings such as the volatility index


*  fiscal and monetary factors


*  geopolitical events and their impact on specific sectors


Mr. Peroni selects stocks he believes are best suited to the trust's
investment objective, which is capital appreciation.



HOW TO BUY UNITS



You can buy units of the trust on any business day the New York Stock
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMLIVE.COM.  The public offering price
of units includes:


*  the net asset value per unit plus


*  organization costs plus


*  the sales fee.


6     Understanding Your Investment





The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.


VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value
after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security.  We
will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national
securities exchange, or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.


We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in
this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the New
York Stock Exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus.  On
the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,
if later.


ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the securities represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your
trust.  These costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement
and legal documents, federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and
expenses of the trustee and the initial audit.  Your trust will sell securities
to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or
after six months, if earlier.  The value of your units will decline when the
trust pays these costs.


TRANSACTIONAL SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.
We refer to this fee as the "transactional sales fee."  The transactional sales
fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals 3.35% of the public
offering price per unit based on a $10 public offering price per unit.  This
percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on
the trust's inception date.  The transactional sales fee equals the difference
between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee.  As a result,
the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the
public offering price per unit varies.  The transactional sales fee does not



Understanding Your Investment     7






include the creation and development fee which is described under "Fees and
Expenses."


The maximum sales fee equals 3.95% of the public offering price per unit at
the time of purchase.  You pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units.
The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage
(maximum of 3.95% of the public offering price per unit) and the sum of the
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation
and development fee.  The initial sales fee will be approximately 1.00% of the
public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit.
The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.245 per unit.  Your trust pays the
deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page 3.  If you
redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee,
you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your
units.


If you purchase units after the last deferred sales fee payment has been
assessed, the secondary market sales fee is equal to 3.95% of the public
offering price and does not include deferred payments (i.e., unitholders who buy
in the secondary market after collection of the deferred sales fees are not
charged deferred sales fees).


MINIMUM PURCHASE.  The minimum amount you can purchase of the trust appears
on page 3 under "Essential Information", but such amounts may vary depending on
your selling firm.


REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of
any discount when you order units.  Except as expressly provided herein, you may
not combine discounts.  Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and
development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these
fees per unit regardless of any discounts.  However, if you are eligible to
receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the fixed dollar
amounts of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee, we will
credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these fixed dollar
fees at the time you buy units.


Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of
your investment:








 IF YOU PURCHASE:        YOUR FEE WILL BE:
------------------------------------------

Less than $50,000             3.95%
$50,000 - $99,999             3.70
$100,000 - $249,999           3.45
$250,000 - $499,999           3.10
$500,000 - $999,999           2.95
$1,000,000 or more            2.45








We apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the
time of purchase.  The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration
purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to
the requirements that only whole units be issued.


You aggregate initial offering period unit orders submitted by the same
person for units of any of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one
broker-dealer to qualify for a purchase level.  If you purchase initial offering
period units that qualify for the fee account or rollover/exchange discount
described below and also purchase additional initial offering period units on a
single day from the same broker-dealer that do not qualify for the fee account
or rollover/exchange discount, you aggregate all initial offering period units
purchased for purposes of determining the applicable breakpoint level in the
table above on the additional units, but such


8     Understanding Your Investment





additional units will not qualify for the fee account or rollover/exchange
discount described below.  Secondary market unit purchases are not aggregated
with initial offering period unit purchases for purposes of determining the
applicable breakpoint level.  You can also include these orders as your own for
purposes of this aggregation:


*  orders submitted by your spouse or children (including step-children)
under 21 years of age living in the same household and


*  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.


The discounts described above apply only to initial offering period
purchases.


Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed.  You should
consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these
accounts.  To purchase units in these Fee Accounts, your financial advisor must
purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if
available.  Please contact your financial advisor for more information.  If
units of the trust are purchased for a Fee Account and the units are subject to
a Wrap Fee in such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible") then
investors may be eligible to purchase units of the trust in these Fee Accounts
that are not subject to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the
creation and development fee that is retained by the sponsor.  For example, this
table illustrates the sales fee you will pay as a percentage of the initial $10
public offering price per unit (the percentage will vary with the unit price).








Initial sales fee                0.00%
Deferred sales fee               0.00%
                                -------
  Transactional sales fee        0.00%
                                =======
Creation and development fee     0.50%
                                -------
  Total sales fee                0.50%
                                =======








This discount applies only during the initial offering period.  Certain Fee
Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees on the purchase
and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other processing
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.  We
reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee Accounts by
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be
detrimental to the trust.


Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by
officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of the sponsor
and its affiliates.  These purchases are not subject to the transactional sales
fee but will be subject to the creation and development fee.  We also waive a
portion of the sales fee for purchases made by officers, directors and employees
(and immediate family members) of selling firms.  These purchases are made at
the public offering price per unit less the applicable regular dealer
concession.  Immediate family members for the purposes of this section include
your spouse, children (including step-children) under the age of 21 living in
the same household, and parents (including step-parents).  These discounts apply
to initial offering period and secondary market purchases.  All employee
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm, including but
not limited to, householding policies or limitations.  Only officers, directors
and employees (and their



Understanding Your Investment     9






immediate family members) of selling firms that allow such persons to
participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discount.


Rollover/Exchange Option.  We waive a portion of the sales fee on units of
the trust offered in this prospectus if you buy your units with redemption or
termination proceeds from any unit investment trusts (regardless of sponsor).
You may also purchase units of the trust offered in this prospectus at this
reduced fee if you purchase your units with (1) termination proceeds from an
unaffiliated unit trust or (2) redemption proceeds from an unaffiliated unit
trust if such trust is scheduled to terminate within 30 days of the redemption.
The discounted public offering price per unit for these transactions is equal to
the regular public offering price per unit less 1.00%.  However, if you invest
redemption or termination proceeds of $500,000 or more in units of the trust,
the maximum sales fee on your units will be limited to the maximum sales fee for
the applicable amount invested in the table under "Large Purchases" above.  To
qualify for this discount, the termination or redemption proceeds used to
purchase units of the trust offered in this prospectus must be derived from a
transaction that occurred within 30 calendar days of your purchase of units of
the trust offered in this prospectus.  In addition, the discount will only be
available for investors that utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different
broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for both the unit purchase and the
transaction resulting in the receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds
used for the unit purchase.  You may be required to provide appropriate
documentation or other information to your broker-dealer to evidence your
eligibility for this sales fee discount.


Please note that if you purchase units of the trust in this manner using
redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining
deferred sales fee at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales
fee remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption proceeds.
These discounts apply only to initial offering period purchases.


Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  We do not charge any sales fee when you reinvest
distributions from your trust into additional units of the trust.  This sales
fee discount applies to initial offering period and secondary market purchases.
Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these fees per unit regardless
of this discount.  If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan, we will
credit you with additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover the
amount of any remaining deferred sales fee or creation and development fee that
will be collected on such units at the time of reinvestment.  The dollar value
of these units will fluctuate over time.


RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.



HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS



You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMLIVE.COM or through your financial
professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and
development fee or organization costs if you sell or redeem units during the
initial offering period.


10     Understanding Your Investment





The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to as the "liquidation
price."  You pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem your
units.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for
processing unit redemption or sale requests.


SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset
value, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and development fee
or organization costs if you sell units during the initial offering period.  We
may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or
redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase price is
the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a
secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial professional for
current repurchase prices to determine the best price available.  We may
discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice.  Even if we do not
make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any
business day for the current redemption price.


REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and
development fee or organization costs if you redeem units during the initial
offering period.   You will pay any remaining deferred sales fee at the time you
redeem units.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if the
trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons
that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the
trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price
provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It
is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit
redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in
a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a timely manner or is
incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after
the trustee receives your completed request.


If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.


You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.



Understanding Your Investment     11






The trustee will make any in-kind distribution of securities by distributing
applicable securities in book entry form to the account of your financial
professional at Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole shares of the
applicable securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.  You may not
request this option in the last 30 days of your trust's life.  We may
discontinue this option at any time without notice.


EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.



DISTRIBUTIONS



DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment
income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of
record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution dates are
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this
prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special distribution if it
holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  For example, this could
happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose
stock is in your portfolio.  The trust will also generally make required
distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each
year because it is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal
tax purposes.  The amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as
companies change their dividends or trust expenses change.


ESTIMATED ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual distributions are
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this
prospectus.  We generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive
on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer (or
adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign
issuers) or on scheduled income payments.  However, dividend conventions for
certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in
the United States and in certain instances, dividends paid or declared over
several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions.  Due
to this and various other factors, actual income payments received by the trust
will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled
income payments.  The actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary
with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in income payments received and
with the sale of securities.  The estimated net annual distributions for
subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the
first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio
will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs, the creation
and development fee and the deferred sales fee.


REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each
distribution.  Each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your
trust's activity and certain tax information.  You can request copies of
security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited
financial statements for your trust, if available.


12     Understanding Your Investment






INVESTMENT RISKS



All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.


MARKET RISK.  Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in
your trust will fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall
below your original purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors.  These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or
ratings on a security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you should
remember that we do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a
security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.


DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK.  Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when
declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may
vary over time.


SECTOR CONCENTRATION RISK.  Sector concentration risk is the risk that the
value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that
impact a particular sector because the portfolio concentrates in companies
within that sector.  A portfolio "concentrates" in a sector when securities in a
particular sector make up 25% or more of the portfolio.  Refer to the "Principal
Risks" in the "Investment Summary" section in this prospectus for sector
concentrations.


The trust invests primarily in securities of HEALTH CARE COMPANIES.
Companies in the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or
services.  Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological
advances will render their products obsolete.  The research and development
costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy
governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come
to market.  Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain
products for several years.  Such companies may also have persistent losses
during a new product's transition from development to production, and revenue
patterns may be erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may be
affected by events and conditions including, among other things, demand for
services, the ability of the facility to provide the services required,
physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition
with other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice
insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial
assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar
third-party payor programs.



Understanding Your Investment     13






Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time.  These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of
healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare
insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans.  We are unable to
predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the issuers of
securities in your trust.


FOREIGN ISSUER RISK.  An investment in securities of foreign issuers involves
certain risks that are different in some respects from an investment in
securities of domestic issuers. These include risks associated with future
political and economic developments, international trade conditions, foreign
withholding taxes, liquidity concerns, currency fluctuations, volatility,
restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities, potential for
expropriation of assets, confiscatory taxation, difficulty in obtaining or
enforcing a court judgment, potential inability to collect when a company goes
bankrupt and economic, political or social instability. Moreover, individual
foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy for
reasons including differences in growth of gross domestic product, rates of
inflation, capital reinvestment, resources, self-sufficiency and balance of
payments positions. There may be less publicly available information about a
foreign issuer than is available from a domestic issuer as a result of different
accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards. Some foreign markets are
less liquid than U.S. markets which could cause securities to be bought at a
higher price or sold at a lower price than would be the case in a highly liquid
market.


Securities of certain foreign issuers may be denominated or quoted in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Foreign issuers also make payments and
conduct business in foreign currencies. Many foreign currencies have fluctuated
widely in value against the U.S. dollar for various economic and political
reasons. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of
foreign securities and income payments. Generally, when the U.S. dollar rises in
value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that currency loses
value because the currency is worth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the
U.S. dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency, a security
denominated in that currency gains value because the currency is worth more U.S.
dollars. The U.S. dollar value of income payments on foreign securities will
fluctuate similarly with changes in foreign currency values.


Certain foreign securities may be held in the form of American Depositary
Receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs"), or other similar
receipts. Depositary receipts represent receipts for foreign securities
deposited with a custodian (which may include the trustee of the trust).
Depository receipts may not be denominated in the same currency as the
securities into which they may be converted. ADRs typically trade in the U.S. in
U.S. dollars and are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
GDRs are similar to ADRs, but GDRs typically trade outside of the U.S. and
outside of the country of the issuer in the currency of the country where the
GDR trades. Depositary receipts generally involve most of the same types of
risks as foreign securities held directly but typically also involve additional
expenses associated with the cost of the custodian's services. Some depositary
receipts may experience less liquidity than the underlying securities traded in
their home market. Certain depositary receipts are unsponsored (i.e. issued
without the participation or involvement of the issuer of the


14     Understanding Your Investment





underlying security). The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not
obligated to disclose information that may be considered material in the U.S.
Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers which
can impact the relationship between certain information impacting a security and
the market value of the depositary receipts.


SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  The trust may invest in securities issued by
small and mid-size companies.  The share prices of these companies are often
more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors
common to many such issuers, including limited trading volumes, products or
financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available
information.


LEGISLATION/LITIGATION.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain of the companies represented in the trust.  In addition, litigation
regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented
by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities.  No
one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on
the share prices of the securities.


LIQUIDITY RISK.  Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will
fall if trading in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that
a liquid trading market will exist for any security.


NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.



HOW THE TRUST WORKS



YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to us.
Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.  These
units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.  At the
close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's inception date, the number
of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals $10.
The number of units and fractional interest of each unit in the trust will
increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.


CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Under normal
circumstances, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in health care
companies.  Your trust will generally buy and sell securities:


*  to pay expenses,


*  to issue additional units or redeem units,


*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,


*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
or


*  as permitted by the trust agreement.


When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversification of the
securities in the



Understanding Your Investment     15






portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been made for a security
or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a
security, the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if
the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of
unitholders. The trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders. If an
offer by the issuer of any of the portfolio securities or any other party is
made to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for trust portfolio
securities, the trustee will at the direction of the sponsor, vote for or
against, or accept or reject, any offer for new or exchanged securities or
property in exchange for a trust portfolio security.  If any such issuance,
exchange or substitution occurs (regardless of any action or rejection by a
trust), any securities and/or property received will be deposited into the trust
and will be promptly sold by the trustee pursuant to the sponsor's direction,
unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities or property.  If
any contract for the purchase of securities fails, the sponsor will refund the
cash and sales fee attributable to the failed contract to unitholders on or
before the next distribution date unless substantially all of the moneys held to
cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with
the trust agreement. The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale
proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors
which, in the opinion of the sponsor, would make retention of the securities
detrimental to the trust. In such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated
to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet
the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trust's inception date. The
sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that
the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment
company.


We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio.  When your
trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You
could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and
fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time
your trust buys the securities.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we
may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers
that sell units or are affiliated with us, your trust or the trustee.


Pursuant to an exemptive order, your trust may be able to purchase securities
from other trusts that we sponsor when we create additional units.  Your trust
may also be able to sell securities to other trusts that we sponsor to satisfy
unit redemption, pay deferred sales charges or expenses, in connection with
periodic tax compliance or in connection with the termination of your trust.
The exemption may enable each trust to eliminate commission costs on these
transactions.  The price for those securities will be the closing price on the
sale date on the exchange where the securities are principally traded as
certified by us to the trustee.


AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this
agreement.


TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under


16     Understanding Your Investment





"Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus.
The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less
than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at the time of
deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on
your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may
also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate the trust in
the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are
tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to
less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in
the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales charge that you paid.


The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you
originally paid for your units.


THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Building 800, Suite 102, Wichita, Kansas 67226 or
by using the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a
registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor or become
bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust without a
sponsor, or terminate your trust.


We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your
trust.


The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or
director for the issuers of the securities.


THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust.  Its
principal unit investment trust division office is located at 2 Hanson Place,
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by



Understanding Your Investment     17






calling the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing
to its unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in
some cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us
and investors.


HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  These distribution firms each pay part of the sales fee when
they sell units.  During the initial offering period, the broker-dealer
concession or agency commission for broker-dealers and other firms is as
follows:








  TRANSACTION             CONCESSION OR
    AMOUNT:             AGENCY COMMISSION:
------------------------------------------

Less than $50,000             3.10%
$50,000 - $99,999             2.85
$100,000 - $249,999           2.60
$250,000 - $499,999           2.30
$500,000 - $999,999           2.20
$1,000,000 or more            1.75








We apply these concessions or agency commissions as a percent of the public
offering price per unit at the time of the transaction.  The broker-dealer
concession or agency commission is 65% of the sales fee for secondary market
sales.  For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts
who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase units of the trust,
the broker-dealer concession or agency commission is 2.15% of the public
offering price per unit.  No broker-dealer concession or agency commission is
paid to broker-dealers, investment advisers or other selling firms in connection
with unit sales in Fee Accounts subject to a Wrap Fee.


Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit investment
trusts for which AAM acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional
compensation for volume sales.  The sponsor offers two separate volume
concession structures for certain trusts that are referred to as "Volume
Concession A" and "Volume Concession B."  The trust offered in this prospectus
is a Volume Concession A trust.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units
of any Volume Concession A trust are eligible to receive the additional
compensation described below.  Such payments will be in addition to the regular
concessions paid to firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus.
The additional concession is based on total initial offering period sales of all
Volume Concession A trusts during a calendar quarter as set forth in the
following table:








  INITIAL OFFERING PERIOD SALES                  VOLUME
     DURING CALENDAR QUARTER                   CONCESSION
---------------------------------------------------------

Less than $10,000,000                            0.000%
$10,000,000 but less than $25,000,000            0.050
$25,000,000 but less than $50,000,000            0.100
$50,000,000 but less than $75,000,000            0.110
$75,000,000 but less than $100,000,000           0.120
$100,000,000 but less than $250,000,000          0.125
$250,000,000 but less than $500,000,000          0.135
$500,000,000 or more                             0.150








This volume concession will be paid on units of all Volume Concession A
trusts sold in the initial offering period, except as described below.  For a
trust to be eligible for this additional Volume Concession A compensation for
calendar quarter sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related
to this additional Volume Concession A compensation; a trust is not eligible for
this additional Volume Concession A compensation if the prospectus for such
trust does not include disclosure related to this additional Volume Concession A
compensation.  Broker-dealer firms will not receive additional compensation
unless they sell at least $10.0 million of units of Volume Concession A trusts
during a calendar


18     Understanding Your Investment





quarter.  For example, if a firm sells $9.5 million of units of Volume
Concession A trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter,
the firm will not receive any additional compensation with respect to such
trusts.  Once a firm reaches a particular breakpoint during a quarter, the firm
will receive the stated volume concession on all initial offering period sales
of Volume Concession A trusts during the applicable quarter.  For example, if a
firm sells $12.5 million of units of Volume Concession A trusts in the initial
offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive additional
compensation of 0.05% of $12.5 million and if a firm sells $27.0 million of
units of Volume Concession A trusts in the initial offering period during a
calendar quarter, the firm will receive additional compensation of 0.100% of
$27.0 million.


In addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge.  However, such
sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level
breakpoints for volume concessions subject to the policies of the related
selling firm.  Secondary market sales of all unit trusts are excluded for
purposes of these volume concessions.  We will pay these amounts out of our own
assets within a reasonable time following each calendar quarter.


Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of
the broker-dealer concession or agency commission.  We reserve the right to
change the amount of concessions or agency commissions from time to time.


We currently provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,
additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial
advisors for past sales.  A number of factors are considered in determining
whether to pay these additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the
level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its
agents, the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list
and access to an intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to,
expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising,
sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of
unit sales among an intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf
space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale
of our products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of
intermediaries that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or
on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the
purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or
purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional
compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described
above, some of which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an
incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our
products, including this trust, over other products.  These arrangements will
not change the price you pay for your units.


We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in
part.



Understanding Your Investment     19






We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to
create units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of
securities into the trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio."



TAXES



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax
treatment of the assets to be deposited in your trust.  This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


TRUST STATUS.  Your trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the federal tax laws.  If your trust qualifies as a regulated
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, your
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.  If your trust invests in a
partnership, an adverse federal income tax audit of that partnership could
result in the trust being required to pay federal income tax or pay a deficiency
dividend (without having received additional cash).


DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's
distributions into three categories, ordinary income distributions, capital gain
dividends and return of capital.  Ordinary income distributions are generally
taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, certain
ordinary income distributions received from your trust may be taxed at the
capital gains tax rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gain dividends
as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units.  To
determine your actual tax liability for your capital gain dividends, you must
calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering
all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In addition, your
trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes
and thus will generally not be taxable to you.  A return of capital, although
not initially taxable to you, will result in a reduction in the basis in your
units and subsequently result in higher levels of taxable capital gains in the
future.  In addition, if the non-dividend distribution exceeds your basis in
your units, you will have long-term or short-term gain depending upon your
holding period.  The tax status of your distributions from your trust is not
affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or
receive them in cash.  The income from your trust that you must take into
account for federal income tax


20     Understanding Your Investment





purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.
The tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if
you had received them on December 31 of the previous year.  Income from your
trust may also be subject to a 3.8 percent "medicare tax."  This tax generally
applies to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds
certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples
filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.


DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received from your trust because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by your trust from certain corporations may be
reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.


SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.


CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain
is generally 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15% for taxpayers in
the 25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in the 10% and 15%
tax brackets.  Some portion of your capital gain dividends may be subject to
higher maximum marginal stated federal income tax rates.  Some portion of your
capital gain dividends may be attributable to the trust's interest in a master
limited partnership which may be subject to a maximum marginal stated federal
income tax rate of 28%, rather than the rates set forth above.  In addition,
capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered
"unrecaptured section 1250 gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some
capital gains attributable to equity interests in real estate investment trusts
that constitute interests in entities treated as real estate investment trusts
for federal income tax purposes) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%.
In the case of capital gain dividends, the determination of which portion of the
capital gain dividend, if any, is subject to the 28% tax rate or the 25% tax
rate, will be made based on rules prescribed by the United States Treasury.
Capital gains may also be subject to the "medicare tax" described above.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the
same as for ordinary income.  The Internal



Understanding Your Investment     21






Revenue Code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special
situations.


Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a
regulated investment company such as your trust are generally taxed at the same
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are
attributable to qualifying dividends received by your trust itself.
Distributions with respect to shares in real estate investment trusts are
qualifying dividends only in limited circumstances.  Your trust will provide
notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken
into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates.


IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of trust securities when you
redeem units or when your trust terminates.  This distribution will be treated
as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain
or loss, generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the
amount of cash received.  The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that
a loss could not be currently deducted.


ROLLOVERS AND EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust
rolled over into a future trust, the exchange would generally be considered a
sale for federal income tax purposes.


DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In some cases,
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as
income.  In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.  Some individuals may also
be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions,
depending on their income.


FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.


INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.  If your trust holds an equity
interest in any "passive foreign investment companies" ("PFICs"), which are
generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual
gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents
and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in
investments producing such passive income, the trust could be subject to U.S.
federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain
distributions with respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or
gain is timely distributed to its unitholders.  Your trust will not be able to
pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes.  Your
trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax
consequences.  In this case, your trust would recognize as ordinary income any
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in
such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income.
Under this election, your trust might be required to recognize in a year income
in excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of
PFIC stock


22     Understanding Your Investment





during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to the
distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4%
excise tax.  Dividends paid by PFICs are not treated as qualified dividend
income.


FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from your trust will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which your trust properly reports as
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However,
distributions received by a foreign investor from your trust that are properly
reported by your trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that your trust
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met.  Distributions
from your trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interest-related
dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a
short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net short-term capital
gain income received by the trust may not be subject to U.S. federal income
taxes, including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors,
provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are
met.  In addition, distributions in respect of units may be subject to a U.S.
withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-U.S.
financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the U.S.
Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a
jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury and

(ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications
and information about the entity's U.S. owners.  Dispositions of units by such
persons may be subject to such withholding after December 31, 2018.  You should
also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and
reporting requirements.



EXPENSES



Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the
estimated amount of these expenses.


The sponsor will receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions.  This "creation and
development fee" is a charge of $0.05 per unit.  The trustee will deduct this
amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period.
No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as
compensation for sales efforts.  This fee will not be deducted from proceeds
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before the close of
the initial public offering period.


Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of
services provided to all



Understanding Your Investment     23






of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.   All of these fees may
adjust for inflation without your approval.


Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the
sponsor, legal fees and expenses and expenses incurred in contacting you.  Your
trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.  The
trustee will generally pay trust expenses from distributions received on the
securities but in some cases may sell securities to pay trust expenses.

ADVISORS DISCIPLINED TRUST 1666



We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the
trust portfolio on pages 4 and 5, of Advisors Disciplined Trust 1666, as of
June 7, 2016, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial
condition is the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our
audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the trust's internal control over financial
reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the trust's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of
financial condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by the sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall statement of
financial condition presentation.  Our procedures included confirmation with
The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit
deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of financial
condition as of June 7, 2016.  We believe that our audit of the statement
of financial condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined
Trust 1666 as of June 7, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the closing sale price
     evaluations as determined by the evaluator.
(2)  Cash or an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited with the trustee
     covering the funds (aggregating $200,000) necessary for the purchase of
     securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.
(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing and offering
     the trust.  These costs have been estimated at $0.038 per unit for the
     trust.  A distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the
     initial offering period or six months following the trust's inception date
     to an account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation of the
     investors will be satisfied.  To the extent the actual organization costs
     are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization
     costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the sponsor
     and deducted from the assets of the trust.
(4)  The total sales fee consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee
     and a creation and development fee.  The initial sales fee is equal to the
     difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining
     deferred sales fee and the total creation and development fee.  On the
     inception date, the total sales fee is 3.95% of the public offering price
     per unit.  The deferred sales fee is equal to $0.245 per unit and the
     creation and development fee is equal to $0.05 per unit.
(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming
     no reduction of sales fees.

GENERAL INFORMATION



Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the
initial date of deposit set forth in the prospectus for such trust under the
laws of the state of New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement
among Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as sponsor/depositor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).


When a trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities
or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee
delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the
trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on a trust's initial date of
deposit or the first day units are offered to the public, the number of units
may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals $10.  The
number of units, fractional interest of each unit in a trust and any estimated
income distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any
adjustment.  Additional units of a trust may be issued from time to time by
depositing in the trust additional securities (or contracts for the purchase
thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit) or cash (including
a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional
securities.  As additional units are issued by a trust, the aggregate value of
the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided
interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased.  The sponsor
may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust, provided
that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain
the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust.
Thus, although additional units will be issued, each unit will generally
continue to represent the approximately same number of shares of each security.
If the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities, existing and new
investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a
trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.


Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any
failure in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase
of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will,
unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase
are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement,
refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all
unitholders on the next distribution date.



INVESTMENT  POLICIES



Each trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed"
fund.  Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic,
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.


-2-





The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in special circumstances as provided in the
applicable trust agreement.  Thus, the assets of a trust will generally remain
unchanged under normal circumstances.  Each trust agreement provides that the
sponsor may direct the trustee to sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of
securities in the trust at such price and time and in such manner as shall be
determined by the sponsor, provided that the supervisor has determined, if
appropriate, that any one or more of the following conditions exist with respect
to such securities: (i) that there has been a default in the payment of
dividends, after declared and when due and payable; (ii) that any action or
proceeding has been instituted at law or equity seeking to restrain or enjoin
the payment of dividends, or that there exists any legal question or impediment
affecting such securities or the payment of dividends from the same; (iii) that
there has occurred any breach of covenant or warranty in any document relating
to the issuer of the securities which would adversely affect either immediately
or contingently the payment of dividends on the securities, or the general
credit standing of the issuer or otherwise impair the sound investment character
of such securities; (iv) that there has been a default in the payment of
dividends, principal of or income or premium, if any, on any other outstanding
obligations of the issuer of such securities; (v) that the price of the security
has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the
opinion of the supervisor, as evidenced in writing to the trustee, the retention
of such securities would be detrimental to the trust and to the interest of the
unitholders; (vi) that all of the securities in the trust will be sold pursuant
to termination of the trust; (vii) that such sale is required due to units
tendered for redemption; (viii) that there has been a public tender offer made
for a security or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security, and
that in the opinion of the supervisor the sale or tender of the security is in
the best interest of the unitholders; (ix) if the trust is designed to be a
grantor trust for tax purposes, that the sale of such securities is required in
order to prevent the trust from being deemed an association taxable as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes; (x) if the trust has elected to be
a "regulated investment company" for tax purposes, that such sale is necessary
or advisable (a) to maintain the qualification of the trust as a "regulated
investment company" or (b) to provide funds to make any distribution for a
taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on the
trust or on undistributed income in the trust; (xi) that as result of the
ownership of the security, the trust or its unitholders would be a direct or
indirect shareholder of a passive foreign investment company as defined in
section 1297(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; or (xii) that such sale is
necessary for the trust to comply with such federal and/or state securities
laws, regulations and/or regulatory actions and interpretations which may be in
effect from time to time.  The trustee may also sell securities, designated by
the supervisor, from a trust for the purpose of the payment of expenses.  In the
event a security is sold as a direct result of serious adverse credit factors
affecting the issuer of such security and a trust is a "regulated investment
company" for tax purposes, then the sponsor may, if permitted by applicable law,
but is not obligated, to direct the reinvestment of the proceeds of the sale of
such security in any other securities which meet the criteria necessary for
inclusion in such trust on the initial date of deposit.


If the trustee is notified at any time of any action to be taken or
proposed to be taken by holders of the portfolio securities, the trustee will
notify the sponsor and will take such action or refrain from taking any action
as the sponsor directs and, if the sponsor does not within five business days of
the giving of such notice direct the trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action, the trustee will take such reasonable action or refrain from taking any
action so that the


-3-





securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same
general proportion, with respect to all issues, as are shares of such securities
that are held by owners other than the trust.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that the trustee shall have been notified at any time of any action to
be taken or proposed to be taken by holders of shares of any registered
investment company, the trustee will thereupon take such reasonable action or
refrain from taking any action with respect to the fund shares so that the fund
shares are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general
proportion, with respect to all issues, as are shares of such fund shares that
are held by owners other than the related trust.


In the event that an offer by the issuer of any of the securities or any
other party is made to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for
trust portfolio securities, the trustee will reject such offer, provided that in
the case of a trust that is a "regulated investment company" for tax purposes,
if an offer by the issuer of any of the securities or any other party is made to
issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for trust portfolio securities,
the trustee will at the direction of the sponsor, vote for or against, or accept
or reject, any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for
a trust portfolio security.  If any such issuance, exchange or substitution
occurs (regardless of any action or rejection by a trust), any securities, cash
and/or property received will be deposited into the trust and will be promptly
sold, if securities or property, by the trustee pursuant to the sponsor's
direction, unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities, cash
or property.  The sponsor may rely on the supervisor in so advising the trustee.


Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital
Account of the trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in a prospectus or in a
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the
portfolio securities is prohibited.


Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the
proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be
reinvested, no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of
time its present size and composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.
In the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a
trust under a contract ("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under
the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities
("Replacement Securities") to make up the original corpus of such trust.


The Replacement Securities must be securities as originally selected for
deposit in a trust or, in the case of a trust that is a "regulated investment
company" for tax purposes, securities which the sponsor determines to be similar
in character as the securities originally selected for deposit in the trust and
the purchase of the Replacement Securities may not adversely affect the federal
income tax status of the trust.  The Replacement Securities must be purchased
within thirty days after the deposit of the Failed Security.  Whenever a
Replacement Security is acquired for a trust, the trustee shall notify all
unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the Replacement Security and
shall, on the next monthly distribution date which is more than thirty days
thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the
cost to the trust


-4-





of the Failed Security exceeded the cost of the Replacement Security.  The
trustee will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of any purchase made pursuant to, or any failure to make any
purchase of Replacement Securities.  The sponsor will not be liable for any
failure to instruct the trustee to purchase any Replacement Securities, nor
shall the trustee or sponsor be liable for errors of judgment in connection with
Failed Securities or Replacement Securities.


If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to such Failed
Securities to all unitholders of the related trust and the trustee will
distribute the cash attributable to such Failed Securities not more than thirty
days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a
Replacement Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that, at the
time of receipt of such cash, they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in
other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such
proceeds would have earned for unitholders of a trust.  In the event that a
Replacement Security is not acquired by a trust, the income for such trust may
be reduced.



RISK FACTORS



An investment in units of a trust, and/or shares of other registered
investment companies ("funds") held by a trust, if any, may be subject to some
or all of the risks described below.  In addition, you should carefully review
the objective, strategy and risk of the trust as described in the prospectus and
consider your ability to assume the risks involved before making an investment
in a trust.


MARKET RISK. You should understand the risks of investing in securities
before purchasing units. These risks include the risk that the financial
condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen
and the value of the securities (and therefore units) will fall. Securities are
especially susceptible to general stock market movements. The value of
securities often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence
and perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on factors
including expectations regarding government economic policies, inflation,
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates and
economic or banking crises. The value of units of a trust will fluctuate with
the value of the securities in the trust and may be more or less than the price
you originally paid for your units. As with any investment, no one can guarantee
that the performance of a trust will be positive over any period of time.
Because each trust is unmanaged, the trustee will not sell securities in
response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments. In
addition, because some trusts hold a relatively small number of securities, you
may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment.


EQUITY SECURITIES.  Investments in securities representing equity ownership
of a company are exposed to risks associated with the companies issuing the
securities, the sectors and geographic locations they are involved in and the
markets that such securities are traded on among other risks as described in
greater detail below.


-5-





FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.  Investments in fixed income and similar
securities involve certain unique risks such as credit risk and interest rate
risk among other things as described in greater detail below.


DIVIDENDS.  Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company.  Common stockholders have a right to receive
payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors,
bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company.  This means that common
stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of
directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  If a company issues
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common
stock was issued first.  As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.


CREDIT RISK.  Credit risk is the risk that a borrower is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on a security.  This could cause the
value of an investment to fall and may reduce the level of dividends an
investment pays which would reduce income.


INTEREST RATE RISK.  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed
income securities and similar securities will fall if interest rates increase.
Bonds and other fixed income securities typically fall in value when interest
rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall.  Securities with longer
periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.


LIQUIDITY RISK.  Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security
will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee
that a liquid trading market will exist for any security.


INVESTMENT IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES.  As with other investments,
investments in other investment companies are subject to market and selection
risk.  In addition, when a trust acquires shares of investment companies,
unitholders bear both their proportionate share of fees and expenses in the
trust and, indirectly, the expenses of the underlying investment companies.
Investment companies' expenses are subject to the risk of fluctuation including
in response to fluctuation in a fund's assets.  Accordingly, a fund's actual
expenses may vary from what is indicated at the time of investment by a trust.
There are certain regulatory limitations on the ability of a trust to hold other
investment companies which may impact the trust's ability to invest in certain
funds, the weighting of the fund in a trust's portfolio and the trust's ability
to issue additional units in the future.


CLOSED-END FUNDS.  Closed-end investment companies ("closed-end funds") are
actively managed investment companies registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 that invest in various types of securities.  Closed-end funds issue
shares of common stock that are generally traded on a securities exchange
(although some closed-end fund shares are not listed on a securities exchange).
Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including management's ability to
meet the closed-end fund's investment objective, and to manage the closed-end
fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during
periods of market turmoil


-6-





and as investors' perceptions regarding closed-end funds or their underlying
investments change. If a trust invests in closed-end funds, you will bear not
only your share of the trust's expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying
funds.  By investing in the other funds, a trust may incur greater expenses than
you would incur if you invested directly in the closed-end funds.


The net asset value of closed-end fund shares will fluctuate with changes
in the value of the underlying securities that the closed-end fund owns.  In
addition, for various reasons closed-end fund shares frequently trade at a
discount from their net asset value in the secondary market.  This risk is
separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closed-end fund
shares may decrease.  The amount of such discount from net asset value is
subject to change from time to time in response to various factors.


Certain closed-end funds employ the use of leverage in their portfolios
through the issuance of preferred stock, debt or other borrowings.  While
leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closed-end fund, this leverage
also subjects the closed-end fund to increased risks.  These risks may include
the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closed-end
fund's common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred
shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises.


Closed-end funds' governing documents may contain certain anti-takeover
provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a fund's possible conversion
to open-end status and limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control
of a fund.  In certain circumstances, these provisions might also inhibit the
ability of stockholders (including a trust) to sell their shares at a premium
over prevailing market prices.  This characteristic is a risk separate and
distinct from the risk that a fund's net asset value will decrease.  In
particular, this characteristic would increase the loss or reduce the return on
the sale of those closed-end fund shares that were purchased by a trust at a
premium.  In the unlikely event that a closed-end fund converts to open-end
status at a time when its shares are trading at a premium there would be an
immediate loss in value to a trust since shares of open-end funds trade at net
asset value.  Certain closed-end funds may have in place or may put in place in
the future plans pursuant to which the fund may repurchase its own shares in the
marketplace.  Typically, these plans are put in place in an attempt by a fund's
board of directors to reduce a discount on its share price.  To the extent that
such a plan is implemented and shares owned by a trust are repurchased by a
fund, the trust's position in that fund will be reduced and the cash will be
distributed.


A trust may be prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for shares
of any of the closed-end funds in which it invests.  In the event of a rights
offering for additional shares of a fund, unitholders should expect that a trust
holding shares of the fund will, at the completion of the offer, own a smaller
proportional interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case.  It is not
possible to determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without
knowing what proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed.
This may be particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the
offer is less than the fund's net asset value per share.  Assuming that all
rights are exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share,
the aggregate net asset value of each shareholder's shares of common stock
should decrease as a result of the offer.  If a fund's subscription price per
share is below that fund's net asset value per share at the expiration of the
offer, shareholders would experience an immediate


-7-





dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares of common stock as a
result of the offer, which could be substantial.


BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES.  Business development companies ("BDCs")
are closed-end investment companies that have elected to be treated as business
development companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. BDCs are
required to at least 70% of their investments in eligible assets which include,
among other things, (i) securities of eligible portfolio companies (generally,
domestic companies that are not investment companies and that cannot have a
class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or have securities
that are marginable that are purchased from that company in a private
transaction), (ii) securities received by the BDC in connection with its
ownership of securities of eligible portfolio companies, or (iii) cash, cash
items, government securities, or high quality debt securities maturing one year
or less from the time of investment.


BDCs' ability to grow and their overall financial condition is impacted
significantly by their ability to raise capital. In addition to raising capital
through the issuance of common stock, BDCs may engage in borrowing. This may
involve using revolving credit facilities, the securitization of loans through
separate wholly-owned subsidiaries and issuing of debt and preferred securities.
BDCs are less restricted than other closed-end funds as to the amount of debt
they can have outstanding. Generally, a BDC may not issue any class of senior
security representing an indebtedness unless, immediately after such issuance or
sale, it will have asset coverage of at least 200%.  (Thus, for example, if a
BDC has $5 million in assets, it can borrow up to $5 million, which would result
in assets of $10 million and debt of $5 million.) These borrowings, also known
as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and,
accordingly, the risks associated with investing in BDC securities. While the
value of a BDC's assets increases, leveraging would cause the net value per
share of BDC common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had such
BDC not leveraged. However, if the value of a BDC's assets decreases, leveraging
would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have
had such BDC not leveraged. In addition to decreasing the value of a BDC's
common stock, it could also adversely impact a BDC's ability to make dividend
payments. A BDC's credit rating may change over time which could adversely
affect their ability to obtain additional credit and/or increase the cost of
such borrowing. Agreements governing BDC's credit facilities and related funding
and service agreements may contain various covenants that limit the BDC's
discretion in operating its business along with other limitations.  Any defaults
may restrict the BDC's ability to manage assets securing related assets which
may adversely impact the BDC's liquidity and operations.


BDCs compete with other BDCs along with a large number of investment funds,
investment banks and other sources of financing to make their investments.
Competitors may have lower costs or access to funding sources that cause BDCs to
lose prospective investments if they do not match competitors' pricing, terms
and structure.  As a result of this competition, there is no assurance that a
BDC will be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment
opportunities or that they will fully be able to invest available capital.


BDC investments are frequently not publicly traded and, as a result, there
is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments. BDCs may use
independent valuation firms to


-8-





value their investments and such valuations may be uncertain, be based on
estimates and/or differ materially from that which would have been used if a
ready market for those investments existed. The value of a BDC could be
adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair value of investments
was materially higher than the value realized upon sale of such investments. Due
to the relative illiquidity of certain BDC investments, if a BDC is required to
liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly, it may realize
significantly less than the value at which such investments are recorded.
Further restrictions may exist on the ability to liquidate certain assets to the
extent that subsidiaries or related parties have material non-public information
regarding such assets.


BDCs may enter into hedging transaction and utilize derivative instruments
such as forward contracts, options and swaps. Unanticipated movements and
improper correlation of hedging instruments may prevent a BDC from hedging
against exposure to risk of loss. BDCs are required to make available
significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies. Significant
managerial assistance refers to any arrangement whereby a BDC provides
significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or
business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Examples of such
activities include arranging financing, managing relationships with financing
sources, recruiting management personnel, and evaluating acquisition and
divestiture opportunities. BDCs are frequently externally managed by an
investment adviser which may also provide this external managerial assistance to
portfolio companies. Such investment adviser's liability may be limited under
their investment advisory agreement which may lead such investment adviser to
act in a riskier manner than it would were it investing for its own account.
Such investment advisers may be entitled to incentive compensation which may
cause such adviser to make more speculative and riskier investments than it
would if investing for its own account. Such compensation may be due even in the
case of declines to the value of a BDC's investments.


BDCs may issue options, warrants, and rights to convert to voting
securities to its officers, employees and board members. Any issuance of
derivative securities requires the approval of the company's board of directors
and authorization by the company's shareholders. A BDC may operate a profit-
sharing plan for its employees, subject to certain restrictions. BDCs frequently
have high expenses which may include, but are not limited to, the payment of
management fees, administration expenses, taxes, interest payable on debt,
governmental charges, independent director fees and expenses, valuation
expenses, and fees payable to third parties relating to or associated with
making investments. These expenses may fluctuate significantly over time.


If a BDC fails to maintain its status as a BDC it may be regulated as a
closed-end fund which would subject such BDC to additional regulatory
restrictions and significantly decrease its operating flexibility. In addition,
such failure could trigger an event of default under certain outstanding
indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on its business.


EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS.  Exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") are typically
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that
have obtained exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission
allowing fund shares to trade on a securities exchange.  Shares of ETFs may
trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary


-9-





market.  This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset
value of ETFs may decrease.  The amount of such discount from net asset value is
subject to change from time to time in response to various factors.  ETFs are
subject to various risks, including management's ability to meet the ETF's
investment objective, and to manage the ETF portfolio when the underlying
securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as
investors' perceptions regarding ETFs or their underlying investments change.  A
trust and any underlying ETFs have operating expenses.  If a trust invests in
ETFs, you will bear not only your share of the trust's expenses, but also the
expenses of the underlying funds.  By investing in the other funds, a trust may
incur greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the
funds.


Most ETFs replicate the composition or returns of a securities index.
These ETFs face index correlation risk which is the risk that the performance of
an ETF will vary from the actual performance of the fund's target index, known
as "tracking error."  This can happen due to transaction costs, market impact,
corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs) and timing variances.  Some
funds use a technique called "representative sampling," which means that the
fund invests in a representative sample of securities in its target index rather
than all of the index securities.  This could increase the risk of tracking
error.


Some ETFs are open-end funds.  Open-end funds of this type can be actively-
managed or passively-managed investment companies that are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  These open-end funds have received orders from
the Securities and Exchange Commission exempting them from various provisions of
the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Regular open-end funds generally issue
redeemable securities that are issued and redeemed at a price based on the
fund's current net asset value and are not traded on a securities exchange.
Exchange-traded open-end funds, however, issue shares of common stock that are
traded on a securities exchange based on negotiated prices rather than the
fund's current net asset value.  These funds only issue new shares and redeem
outstanding shares in very large blocks, often called "creation units," in
exchange for an in-kind distribution of the fund's portfolio securities.  Due to
a variety of cost and administrative factors, a trust that invests in ETFs will
generally buy and sell shares of its underlying open-end fund ETFs on securities
exchanges rather than engaging in transactions in creation units.  Shares of
exchange-traded open-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market.  This risk is separate and distinct from
the risk that the net asset value of open-end fund shares may decrease.  The
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to
time in response to various factors.


Some ETFs are unit investment trusts ("UITs").  UITs of this type are
passively-managed investment companies that are registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.  ETFs that are UITs differ significantly from your trust in
certain respects, even though the UITs that may be held in the trust's portfolio
and the trust itself are registered unit investment trusts.  UITs that are ETFs
have received orders from the Securities and Exchange Commission exempting them
from various provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Regular UITs,
such as your trust, generally issue redeemable securities that are issued and
redeemed at a price based on the UIT's current net asset value and are not
traded on a securities exchange.  ETFs that are UITs, however, issue units that
are traded on a securities exchange based on negotiated prices rather than the
UIT's current net asset value.  These UITs only issue new shares and redeem


-10-





outstanding shares in very large blocks, often called "creation units," in
exchange for an in-kind distribution of the UIT's portfolio securities.  Due to
a variety of cost and administrative factors, a trust that invests in ETFs will
generally buy and sell shares of its underlying ETFs on securities exchanges
rather than engaging in transactions in creation units.  Units of exchange-
traded UITs frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the
secondary market.  This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net
asset value of UIT units may decrease.  The amount of such discount from net
asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various
factors.


INVERSE ETFS.  Certain ETFs may be "inverse" ETFs.  An inverse ETF,
sometimes referred to as a "bear ETF" or "short ETF," is a special type of index
ETF that is designed to provide investment results that move in the opposite
direction of the daily price movement of the index to which it is benchmarked.
Put another way, an inverse ETF is designed to go up in value when its benchmark
index goes down in value, and go down in value when its benchmark index goes up
in value.  Inverse ETFs can be used to establish a hedge position within an
investment portfolio to attempt to protect its value during market declines.
Though inverse ETFs may reduce downside risk and volatility in a down market,
they are not suitable for all investors. The value of an inverse investment may
tend to increase on a daily basis by the amount of any decrease in the index,
but the converse is also true that the value of the investment will also tend to
decrease on a daily basis by the amount of any increase in the index.


Investing in inverse ETFs involves certain risks, which may include
increased volatility due to the ETFs' possible use of short sales of securities
and derivatives such as options and futures. Inverse ETFs are subject to active
trading risks that may increase volatility and impact the ETFs' ability to
achieve their investment objectives. The use of leverage by an ETF increases the
risk to the ETF. The more an ETF invests in leveraged instruments, the more the
leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments.  Most inverse
ETFs "reset" daily, meaning that they are designed to achieve their stated
objectives on a daily basis only and not over any longer time period.  Due to
the effect of compounding, the performance of these ETFs over longer periods of
time can differ significantly from the inverse of the performance of the ETF's
underlying index or benchmark during the same period of time.  This effect can
be magnified in volatile markets.  Inverse ETFs typically are not suitable for
retail investors who plan to hold them for more than one trading session,
particularly in volatile markets.


LEVERAGED ETFS.  Certain ETFs may be "leveraged" ETFs.  These ETFs seek to
match a multiple or multiples of the performance, or the inverse of the
performance, of a benchmark index on a given day and not for greater periods of
time. This means that the return of a leveraged ETF for a period longer than a
single day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period
and not the point-to-point return of the index over the entire time period. As a
result, the use of leverage will very likely cause the performance of such an
ETF to be either greater than, or less than, the index performance times the
stated multiple in an ETF's investment objective. Investors should recognize
that the degree of volatility of the underlying index can have a dramatic effect
on an ETF's longer-term performance. The greater the volatility, given a
particular index return, the greater the downside deviation will be of the ETF's
longer-term performance from a simple multiple of its index's longer-term
return. Leveraged ETFs use investment techniques that may be considered
aggressive, including the use of futures contracts,


-11-





options on futures contracts, securities and indexes, forward contracts, swap
agreements and similar instruments. Leveraged ETFs are typically unsuitable for
investors who plan to hold them for longer than one trading session,
particularly in volatile markets.


NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK.  Certain funds held by a trust may be classified
as "non-diversified."  Such funds may be more exposed to the risks associated
with and developments affecting an individual issuer, industry and/or asset
class than a fund that invests more widely.


FOREIGN ISSUERS.  An investment in securities of non-U.S. issuers involves
certain investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment
in the securities of domestic issuers.  These investment risks include future
political or governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment
or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities, the possibility
that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities may become
impaired or that the general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen
(both of which would contribute directly to a decrease in the value of foreign
securities), the limited liquidity and relatively small market capitalization of
the relevant securities market, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, economic
uncertainties and foreign currency devaluations and fluctuations.  In addition,
for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there may be less publicly available
information than is available from a domestic issuer.  In addition, foreign
issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting, auditing and
financial reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those
applicable to domestic issuers.  The securities of many foreign issuers are less
liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable domestic
issuers.  In addition, fixed brokerage commissions and other transaction costs
in foreign securities markets are generally higher than in the United States and
there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges,
brokers and issuers in foreign countries than there is in the United States.


Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers generally pay income in foreign
currencies and principally trade in foreign currencies.  Therefore, there is a
risk that the U.S. dollar value of these securities will vary with fluctuations
in the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates for the various securities.


There can be no assurance that exchange control regulations might not be
adopted in the future which might adversely affect payment to a trust or a fund
held by a trust.  The adoption of exchange control regulations and other legal
restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of foreign
securities and on the ability to liquidate securities.  In addition,
restrictions on the settlement of transactions on either the purchase or sale
side, or both, could cause delays or increase the costs associated with the
purchase and sale of the foreign securities and correspondingly could affect the
price of trust units.


Investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all securities
at the same time because of the unavailability of any security, and restrictions
applicable to a trust relating to the purchase of a security by reason of the
federal securities laws or otherwise.


-12-





Foreign securities generally have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such
Act.  Sales of non-exempt securities in the United States securities markets are
subject to severe restrictions and may not be practicable.  Accordingly, sales
of these securities will generally be effected only in foreign securities
markets.  Investors should realize that the securities might be traded in
foreign countries where the securities markets are not as developed or efficient
and may not be as liquid as those in the United States.  The value of securities
will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or
absent.


EMERGING MARKETS.  Compared to more mature markets, some emerging markets
may have a low level of regulation, enforcement of regulations and monitoring of
investors' activities.  Those activities may include practices such as trading
on material non-public information.  The securities markets of developing
countries are not as large as the more established securities markets and have
substantially less trading volume, resulting in a lack of liquidity and high
price volatility.  There may be a high concentration of market capitalization
and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of
industries as well as a high concentration of investors and financial
intermediaries.  These factors may adversely affect the timing and pricing of
the acquisition or disposal of securities.  In certain emerging markets,
registrars are not subject to effective government supervision nor are they
always independent from issuers.  The possibility of fraud, negligence, undue
influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists,
which, along with other factors, could result in the registration of a
shareholding being completely lost.  Investors could suffer loss arising from
these registration problems.  In addition, the legal remedies in emerging
markets are often more limited than the remedies available in the United States.


Practices pertaining to the settlement of securities transactions in
emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets, in large
part because of the need to use brokers and counterparties who are less well
capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be
unreliable.  As a result, brokerage commissions and other fees are generally
higher in emerging markets and the procedures and rules governing foreign
transactions and custody may involve delays in payment, delivery or recovery of
money or investments.  Delays in settlement could result in investment
opportunities being missed if a trust or a fund held by a trust is unable to
acquire or dispose of a security.  Certain foreign investments may also be less
liquid and more volatile than U.S. investments, which may mean at times that
such investments are unable to be sold at desirable prices.


Political and economic structures in emerging markets often change rapidly,
which may cause instability.  In adverse social and political circumstances,
governments have been involved in policies of expropriation, confiscatory
taxation, nationalization, intervention in the securities market and trade
settlement, and imposition of foreign investment restrictions and exchange
controls, and these could be repeated in the future.  In addition to withholding
taxes on investment income, some governments in emerging markets may impose
different capital gains taxes on foreign investors.  Foreign investments may
also be subject to the risks of seizure by a foreign government and the
imposition of restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency.
Additionally, some governments exercise substantial influence over the private


-13-





economic sector and the political and social uncertainties that exist for many
developing countries are considerable.


Another risk common to most developing countries is that the economy is
heavily export oriented and, accordingly, is dependent upon international trade.
The existence of overburdened infrastructures and obsolete financial systems
also presents risks in certain countries, as do environmental problems.  Certain
economies also depend to a large degree upon exports of primary commodities and,
therefore, are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices which, in turn, may be
affected by a variety of factors.


DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS.  Certain of the securities in a trust may be in
depositary receipt form, including American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") or
Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs"). Depositary receipts represent stock
deposited with a custodian in a depositary.  Depositary receipts are issued by a
bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a
foreign corporation. These instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the
same currency as the securities into which they may be converted.


Depositary receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored. In an unsponsored
facility, the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of
market makers and acts as agent for the depositary receipts holder, while the
company itself is not involved in the transaction. In a sponsored facility, the
issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative
and shareholder-related expenses. Sponsored facilities use a single depositary
and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer, the shareholder and
the depositary; unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no
contractual relationship to the company. The depositary bank that issues
depositary receipts generally charges a fee, based on the price of the
depositary receipts, upon issuance and cancellation of the depositary receipts.
This fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the
acquisition or surrender of the security. In addition, the depositary bank
incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash
distributions paid in local currency into U.S. dollars and such expenses are
deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders,
resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the depositary
receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly.
Certain tax considerations, including tax rate differentials and withholding
requirements, arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to
nationals of another and from certain practices in the depositary receipts
market may also exist with respect to certain depositary receipts. In varying
degrees, any or all of these factors may affect the value of the depositary
receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market.
In addition, the rights of holders of depositary receipts may be different than
those of holders of the underlying shares, and the market for depositary
receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares. Depositary
receipts are registered securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and
may be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.


For the securities that are depositary receipts, currency fluctuations will
affect the United States dollar equivalent of the local currency price of the
underlying domestic share and, as a result, are likely to affect the value of
the depositary receipts and consequently the value of the securities. The
foreign issuers of securities that are depositary receipts may pay dividends in


-14-





foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars. Most foreign currencies
have fluctuated widely in value against the United States dollar for many
reasons, including supply and demand of the respective currency, the soundness
of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as compared to
the economies of the United States and other countries. Therefore, for any
securities of issuers (whether or not they are in depositary receipt form) whose
earnings are stated in foreign currencies, or which pay dividends in foreign
currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies, there is a risk that their
United States dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the United States
dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies.


CURRENCY RISK.  A trust that invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers will
be subject to currency risk, which is the risk that an increase in the U.S.
dollar relative to the non-U.S. currency will reduce returns or portfolio value.
Generally, when the U.S. dollar rises in value relative to a non-U.S. currency,
a trust's investment in securities denominated in that currency will lose value
because its currency is worth fewer U.S. dollars. On the other hand, when the
value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to a non-U.S. currency, a trust's
investments denominated in that currency will tend to increase in value because
that currency is worth more U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and non-U.S. currencies depend upon such factors as supply and demand in
the currency exchange markets, international balance of payments, governmental
intervention, speculation and other economic and political conditions. A trust
may incur conversion costs when it converts its holdings to another currency.
Non-U.S. exchange dealers may realize a profit on the difference between the
price at which a trust buys and sells currencies. A trust may engage in non-U.S.
currency exchange transactions in connection with its portfolio investments. A
trust may also be subject to currency risk through investments in ADRs, GDRs and
other non-U.S. securities denominated in U.S. dollars.


FOREIGN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES RISK.  The ability of a government issuer,
especially in an emerging market country, to make timely and complete payments
on its debt obligations will be strongly influenced by the government issuer's
balance of payments, including export performance, its access to international
credits and investments, fluctuations of interest rates and the extent of its
foreign reserves.  A country whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities
or whose economy depends on certain strategic imports could be vulnerable to
fluctuations in international prices of these commodities or imports.  If a
government issuer cannot generate sufficient earnings from foreign trade to
service its external debt, it may need to depend on continuing loans and aid
from foreign governments, commercial banks, and multinational organizations.
There are no bankruptcy proceedings similar to those in the United States by
which defaulted government debt may be collected.  Additional factors that may
influence a government issuer's ability or willingness to service debt include,
but are not limited to, a country's cash flow situation, the ability of
sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due (where applicable), the
relative size of its debt burden to the economy as a whole, and the issuer's
policy towards the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other international agencies to which a
government debtor may be subject.


SUPRANATIONAL ENTITIES' SECURITIES.  Certain securities are obligations
issued by supranational entities such as the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank).  The government members, or
"stockholders," usually make initial capital


-15-





contributions to supranational entities and in many cases are committed to make
additional capital contributions if a supranational entity is unable to repay
its borrowings.  There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of a
supranational entity will continue to make any necessary additional capital
contributions.  If such contributions are not made, the entity may be unable to
pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, and an investor in such
securities may lose money on such investments.


SMALL-CAP AND MID-CAP COMPANIES.  Smaller company stocks customarily
involve more investment risk than larger company stocks. Small-capitalization
and mid-capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets or
financial resources; may lack management depth or experience; and may be more
vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large
companies. Some of these companies may distribute, sell or produce products
which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key
personnel.


The prices of small or mid-size company securities are often more volatile
than prices associated with large company issues, and can display abrupt or
erratic movements at times, due to limited trading volumes and less publicly
available information. Also, because small-cap and mid-cap companies normally
have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large
companies, it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities
to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact
on prevailing market prices.


REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.  Many factors can have an adverse impact on
the performance of a particular real estate investment trust or other real
estate-related investments (a "REIT"), including its cash available for
distribution, the credit quality of a particular REIT or the real estate
industry generally.  The success of REITs depends on various factors, including
the occupancy and rent levels, appreciation of the underlying property and the
ability to raise rents on those properties. Economic recession, overbuilding,
tax law changes, higher interest rates or excessive speculation can all
negatively impact REITs, their future earnings and share prices.


REITs are subject to risks associated with the direct ownership of real
estate which include, among other factors: general U.S. and global as well as
local economic conditions; decline in real estate values; the financial health
of tenants; overbuilding and increased competition for tenants; oversupply of
properties for sale; changing demographics; changes in interest rates, tax rates
and other operating expenses; changes in government regulations; changes in
zoning laws; the ability of the owner to provide adequate management,
maintenance and insurance; faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital
improvements; the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act;
regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability for
environmental hazards; natural or man-made disasters; changes in the perception
of prospective tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the
properties changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand; and the
unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable
to developers.


Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate
generally and REITs in particular.


-16-





Properties owned by a REIT may not be adequately insured against certain losses
and may be subject to significant environmental liabilities, including
remediation costs.


You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject
to the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical,
and, if a trust or a fund held by a trust acquires REIT securities at or near
the top of the cycle, there is increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT
securities and therefore the value of the units. REITs are also subject to
defaults by borrowers and the market's perception of the REIT industry
generally.


Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute
a certain percentage of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs
require frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and
issuing stock. Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial
amounts of new equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new
properties. This may have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices.
Both existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices
in the future, especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate
prices are relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.


The value of REITs and other real-estate related investments may also be
affected by downturns in the housing and mortgage lending markets.  In the past,
government authorities have engaged in administrative and legislative action
intended to address both short- and long-term difficulties facing the housing
and mortgage lending markets and the broader economy.  No one can predict the
action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have and it
is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or
help improve the state of such difficulties as intended.  Downturns in the
housing market and corresponding government action may have far reaching
consequences into many geographic regions and, consequently, the value of
securities may decline in response to such developments.


MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.  Master limited partnerships ("MLPs") are
limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are generally taxed as
partnerships whose interests are traded on securities exchanges.  MLP ownership
generally consists of a general partner and limited partners.  The general
partner manages the partnership, has an ownership stake in the partnership and
is eligible to receive an incentive distribution.  The limited partners provide
capital to the partnership, have a limited (if any) role in the operation and
management of the partnership and receive cash distributions. Most MLPs
generally operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors and
are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in those sectors.
MLPs are also subject to the risk that authorities could challenge the tax
treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes which could have a negative
impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.


BOND QUALITY RISK.  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in
value if a rating agency decreases or withdraws the bond's rating.


PREPAYMENT RISK.  When interest rates fall, among other factors, the issuer
of a fixed income security may prepay its obligations earlier than expected.
Such amounts will result in early distributions to an investor who may be unable
to reinvest such amounts at the yields


-17-





originally invested which could adversely impact the value of your investment.
Certain bonds include call provisions which expose such an investor to call
risk.  Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before
its stated maturity.  An issuer might call a bond if interest rates, in general,
fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money
for the original purpose.  If an issuer calls a bond, the holder of such bond
will receive principal but will not receive any future interest distributions on
the bond.  Such investor might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high
a yield.  A bond's call price could be less than the price paid for the bond and
could be below the bond's par value.  Certain bonds may also be subject to
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as
certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or
other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and
various other events.


EXTENSION RISK.  When interest rates rise, among other factors, issuers of
a security may pay off obligations more slowly than expected causing the value
of such obligations to fall.


"WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  Certain debt obligations may
have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis.
The delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on
these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of investors on their respective
dates of delivery.  Investors will be "at risk" with respect to all "when, as
and if issued" and "delayed delivery" bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or
loss from fluctuations in the values of such bonds) from the date they purchase
their investment.


PREMIUM SECURITIES.  Certain securities may have been acquired at a market
premium from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on the premium
securities at the time they were purchased by the fund were higher than the
current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating
and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable
securities decrease, the market premium of previously issued securities will be
increased, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities
increase, the market premium of previously issued securities will be reduced,
other things being equal.  The current returns of securities trading at a market
premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable securities
of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium
securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the
face amount becomes payable.  Because part of the purchase price is thus
returned not at maturity but through current income payments, early redemption
of a premium security at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a
reduction in yield.  Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and
redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the
redeemed securities have an offering side valuation which represents a premium
over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted
value.


MARKET DISCOUNT.  Certain fixed income securities may have been acquired at
a market discount from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on
discount securities at the time of purchase are lower than the current market
interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type.  If
such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase, the market
discount of previously issued securities will become greater, and if such
interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline, the market
discount of previously issued securities will be reduced, other things being
equal.  Investors should also note that the


-18-





value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster
than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease.
Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of securities purchased at a
market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market
premium.  In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher
yielding, premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding,
discount securities will be reduced.


ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Original issue discount bonds were
initially issued at a price below their face (or par) value.  These bonds
typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or
above their par value.  In a stable interest rate environment, the market value
of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater
increments as the bonds approach maturity.  The issuers of these bonds may be
able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price
less than the bond's par value.  Under current law, the original issue discount,
which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the
issue price of the bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued
portion is treated as taxable interest income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.


ZERO COUPON BONDS.  Certain bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds.  Zero coupon
bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right
to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any
periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds which do
not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is that a
fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in effect,
on all discount earned during the life of such obligation.  This implicit
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future.  For this reason, zero coupon bonds
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which
pay interest.


RESTRICTED SECURITIES.  Certain securities may only be resold pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act").  Such
securities may not be readily marketable. Restricted securities may be sold only
to purchasers meeting certain eligibility requirements in privately negotiated
transactions or in a public offering with respect to which a registration
statement is in effect under the Securities Act. Where registration of such
securities under the Securities Act is required, an owner may be obligated to
pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may
elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time an owner may be
permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement.  If,
during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop, an owner might
obtain a less favorable price than that which prevailed when it decided to sell.


PREFERRED STOCK RISKS.  Preferred stocks may be susceptible to general
stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as
market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change. These perceptions
are based on unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government,
economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic
expansion or contraction, market liquidity, and global or regional


-19-





political, economic or banking crises. Preferred stocks are also vulnerable to
Congressional reductions in the dividends-received deduction which would
adversely affect the after-tax return to the investors who can take advantage of
the deduction. Such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred
stocks in general. Holders of preferred stocks, as owners of the entity, have
rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are
generally subordinate to those of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations
or, in some cases, other senior preferred stocks of, such issuers. Preferred
stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and, therefore, do not offer
any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as
do debt securities. The issuance of additional debt securities or senior
preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest
and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of
the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of
holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation
or bankruptcy. The value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations
for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding, and thus the value of
the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of a trust to values
higher or lower than those prevailing on the trust's initial date of deposit.


TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES RISKS.  Holders of trust preferred securities
incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of
holding preferred stocks. Trust preferred securities are limited-life preferred
securities that are typically issued by corporations, generally in the form of
interest-bearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations, or by an
affiliated business trust of a corporation, generally in the form of beneficial
interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation, or similarly
structured securities. The maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred
securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures. Trust
preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interest-
bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be
redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for
any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances at any time. Trust preferred securities generally have a yield
advantage over traditional preferred stocks, but unlike preferred stocks,
distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as
interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes. Unlike most
preferred stocks, distributions received from trust preferred securities are
generally not eligible for the dividends received deduction. Certain of the
risks unique to trust preferred securities include: (i) distributions on trust
preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interest-
bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made; (ii) a
corporation issuing the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or
subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up
to 20 consecutive quarters and if such election is made, distributions will not
be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period; (iii)
certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interest-
bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing
corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to
their stated maturity date; (iv) future legislation may be proposed or enacted
that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax
purposes, making redemption of these instruments likely; (v) a corporation may
redeem the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated
debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a
stated call


-20-





date; (vi) trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights;
and (vii) payment of interest on the interest-bearing notes, preferred
securities or subordinated debentures, and therefore distributions on the trust
preferred securities, is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing
corporation.


HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES.  "High-yield" or "junk" securities, the generic
names for securities rated below BBB by Standard & Poor's or below Baa by
Moody's (or similar ratings of other rating agencies), are frequently issued by
corporations in the growth stage of their development, by established companies
whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies
purchased in leveraged buyout transactions.  These obligations that are
considered below "investment grade" and should be considered speculative as such
ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade.  The market for high-
yield securities is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly
financial institutions.  High-yield securities are generally not listed on a
national securities exchange.  Trading of high-yield securities, therefore,
takes place primarily in over-the-counter markets that consist of groups of
dealer firms that are typically major securities firms.  Because the high-yield
security market is a dealer market, rather than an auction market, no single
obtainable price for a given security prevails at any given time.  Prices are
determined by negotiation between traders.  The existence of a liquid trading
market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in
the securities.  There can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of
the securities, that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the
liquidity of the securities in any markets made.  Not all dealers maintain
markets in all high-yield securities.  Therefore, since there are fewer traders
in these securities than there are in "investment grade" securities, the bid-
offer spread is usually greater for high-yield securities than it is for
investment grade securities.  The price at which the securities may be sold to
meet redemptions and the value of a trust may be adversely affected if trading
markets for the securities are limited or absent.


An investment in "high-yield, high-risk" debt obligations or "junk"
obligations may include increased credit risks and the risk that the value of
the units will decline, and may decline precipitously, with increases in
interest rates.  During certain periods there have been wide fluctuations in
interest rates and thus in the value of debt obligations generally.  Certain
high-yield securities may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss of income and principal than are investments in lower-yielding, higher-
rated securities, and their value may decline precipitously because of increases
in interest rates, not only because the increases in rates generally decrease
values, but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy
and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the
credit of issuers of high-yield, high-risk securities resulting in a higher
incidence of defaults among high-yield, high-risk securities. A slowdown in the
economy, or a development adversely affecting an issuer's creditworthiness, may
result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the
rate and at the prices, respectively, that are required to produce sufficient
cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements.  For an issuer that
has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated high-yield,
high-risk securities, an increase in interest rates will increase that issuer's
interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating.
However, many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements
to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt.  This
reduces exposure to increasing rates, but reduces the benefit to the issuer of
declining rates.  The sponsor cannot predict future economic


-21-





policies or their consequences or, therefore, the course or extent of any
similar market fluctuations in the future.


Lower-rated securities tend to offer higher yields than higher-rated
securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers
of lower-rated securities may not be as strong as that of other issuers.
Moreover, if a security is recharacterized as equity by the Internal Revenue
Service for federal income tax purposes, the issuer's interest deduction with
respect to the security will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely
affect the issuer's credit rating.  Because investors generally perceive that
there are greater risks associated with the lower-rated securities, the yields
and prices of these securities tend to fluctuate more than higher- rated
securities with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their issuers.
In addition, the market value of high-yield, high-risk securities may fluctuate
more than the market value of higher-rated securities since these securities
tend to reflect short-term credit development to a greater extent than higher-
rated securities.  Lower-rated securities generally involve greater risks of
loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities.  Issuers of lower-
rated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than issuers
of higher-rated securities and, especially in the case of issuers whose
obligations or credit standing have recently been downgraded, may be subject to
claims by debt-holders, owners of property leased to the issuer or others which,
if sustained, would make it more difficult for the issuers to meet their payment
obligations.  High-yield, high-risk securities are also affected by variables
such as interest rates, inflation rates and real growth in the economy.


Should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or
interest, the holders of such security may incur additional expenses seeking
payment on the defaulted security.  Because the amounts (if any) recovered in
payment under the defaulted security may not be reflected in the value of a fund
held by a trust or units of a trust until actually received, and depending upon
when a unitholder purchases or sells his or her units, it is possible that a
unitholder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any
portion of the payment recovered.


High-yield, high-risk securities are generally subordinated obligations.
The payment of principal (and premium, if any), interest and sinking fund
requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is
subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the
issuer.  Senior obligations generally include most, if not all, significant debt
obligations of an issuer, whether existing at the time of issuance of
subordinated debt or created thereafter.  Upon any distribution of the assets of
an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution, total or partial
liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer,
the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full
before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any
payment.  Moreover, generally no payment with respect to subordinated
indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior
indebtedness.  Thus, in the event of insolvency, holders of senior indebtedness
of an issuer generally will recover more, ratably, than holders of subordinated
indebtedness of that issuer.


MUNICIPAL BONDS.  Certain municipals bonds are "general obligation bonds"
and are general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the
taxing power of such entity.


-22-





Other municipals bonds are "revenue bonds" payable from the income of a specific
project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.
General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit
and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on
the other hand, are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular
facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a
special excise tax or other specific revenue source. There are, of course,
variations in the security of the different bonds, both within a particular
classification and between classifications, depending on numerous factors.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from
mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured or may be
single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from
originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences
located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate
income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to
their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged
premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds are
subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. Additionally,
unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce
revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage
revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, which include certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of
such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its tax-exempt
status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with
applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion
that the interest on the bonds is exempt from Federal income tax under existing
laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various
ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates
for such bonds.


Certain municipal bonds may be health care revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds
issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that
contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's
gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by
future events and conditions including, among other things, demand for services
and the ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition with other
health care facilities, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost
and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs, government regulation
and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance,
including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party
pay or programs.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers,
including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas. General
problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large
construction programs in an inflationary period, the limitations on operations
and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental


-23-





considerations, the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt,
the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy
conservation. In addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities
may from time to time review existing, and impose additional, regulations
governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants,
which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain bonds to make
payments of principal and/or interest on such bonds.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are
derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such bonds are
generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include the
ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.


Certain municipal bonds may be industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have
generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and
receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular
project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers. In some cases, a mortgage
on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the IRBs.
Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon the
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate
guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors
which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company
or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, regulatory and
environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents or
environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or
effected.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease
payments of a governmental entity ("lease obligations"). Lease obligations are
often in the form of certificates of participation. Although the lease
obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which
the municipality's taxing power is pledged, a lease obligation is ordinarily
backed by the municipality's covenant to appropriate for and make the payments
due under the lease obligation. However, certain lease obligations contain "non-
appropriation" clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to
make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such
purpose on a yearly basis. A governmental entity that enters into such a lease
agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease
payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease
payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A
governmental entity's failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its
lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the
obligations secured thereby. Although "non-appropriation" lease


-24-





obligations are secured by the leased property, disposition of the property in
the event of foreclosure might prove difficult.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations of issuers which are, or which
govern the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and whose revenues
are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems, from
tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to
school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a
disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools
in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of
funds available for the payment of school bonds. General problems relating to
college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining
percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals, possible
inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating
costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding,
and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the
revenues or costs of such issuers.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations which are payable from and
secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such
as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and
arenas. The major portion of an airport's gross operating income is generally
derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements
which consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain terminal space
and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be affected by the
ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements. From
time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations
in earnings and traffic, due to increased competition, excess capacity,
increased costs, deregulation, traffic constraints and other factors, and
several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties. Similarly,
payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents
from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in
revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of
a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel
and reduction or loss of rents.


Certain municipal bonds may be obligations which are payable from and
secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities.
Resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam
and convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a
project; contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw materials,
operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or
technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of
a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts
relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose
unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. No one can predict the causes or
likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds prior to the stated
maturity of the bonds.


-25-





Certain municipal bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from
par value at maturity. A "tax-exempt" municipal bond purchased at a market
discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in
the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt
interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates.


Certain municipal bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated
maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call provisions or
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise. A
sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement
of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A refunding is a method
by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds
of a new debt obligation. In general, call provisions are more likely to be
exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it
is at a discount from par. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit
redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may result in a
reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions. Extraordinary
optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of
certain events. Generally, events that may permit the extraordinary optional
redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include,
among others: a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable;
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project
for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; an exercise by a local, state or
Federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or
substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used;
changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or
facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic; changes in law
or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the
agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance
the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes
excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed on the date the bonds are
issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds; an
administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial
part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds;
an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of
the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to
redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds
resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of
certain bonds may have sold or reserved the right to sell, upon the satisfaction
of certain conditions, to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call
bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds. In such
a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption
unless it reacquires the rights from such third party. A third party pursuant to
these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a
time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had
it not sold such rights. No one can predict all of the circumstances which may
result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See also the discussion of
single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more information
on the call provisions of such bonds.

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.  Convertible securities are generally debt
obligations or preferred stock of a company that are convertible into another
security of the company, typically common stock.  Convertible securities
generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than non-convertible fixed-
income securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital
appreciation. The market values of convertible securities tend to decline as
interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline.
However, a convertible security's market value also tends to reflect the market
price of the common stock of the issuing company, particularly when the stock
price is greater than the convertible security's conversion price. The
conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at
which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying
common stock. As the market price of the underlying common stock declines below
the conversion price, the price of the convertible security tends to be
increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security than by
the market price of the underlying common stock. Thus, it may not decline in
price to the same extent as the underlying common stock, and convertible
securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks.
However, mandatory convertible securities (as discussed below) generally do not
limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the
option of the holder. In the event of a liquidation of the issuing company,
holders of convertible securities would be paid before that company's common
stockholders. Consequently, an issuer's convertible securities generally entail
less risk than its common stock. However, convertible securities generally fall
below other debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or
priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower
than such debt obligations. In addition, contingent payment, convertible
securities allow the issuer to claim deductions based on its nonconvertible cost
of debt, which generally will result in deduction in excess of the actual cash
payments made on the securities (and accordingly, holders will recognize income
in amounts in excess of the cash payments received).


Mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of
convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion
price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common
stock, which may be significantly less than par or the price (above or below
par) paid. For these reasons, the risks associated with investing in mandatory
convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common
stocks. Mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield
to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss
upon conversion. Because the market price of a mandatory convertible security
increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as
the convertible security approaches its conversion date, there can be no
assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the potential loss.


SENIOR LOANS.  Senior loans may be issued by banks, other financial
institutions, and other investors to corporations, partnerships, limited
liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts,
recapitalizations, mergers, acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt refinancings
and, to a lesser extent, for general operating and other purposes.  Senior loans
generally are of below investment grade credit quality and may be unrated at the
time of investment. They generally are not registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any state securities commission and generally are not
listed on any securities exchange.

An investment in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior
loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due.
Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, there can be no
assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrower's obligation
in the event of non-payment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated.
Senior loans are typically structured as floating rate instruments in which the
interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes.
As a result, the yield on an investment in senior loans will generally decline
in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate
environment.


The amount of public information available on senior loans generally will
be less extensive than that available for other types of assets. No reliable,
active trading market currently exists for many senior loans, although a
secondary market for certain senior loans does exist. Senior loans are thus
relatively illiquid. If a fund held by a trust invests in senior loans,
liquidity of a senior loan refers to the ability of the fund to sell the
investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the
fund's books. The illiquidity of senior loans may impair a fund's ability to
realized the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary
liquidation of such assets. Because of the lack of an active trading market,
illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external
pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities. However, many
senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by financial
institutions. To the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain
senior loans, the market may be subject to irregular trading activity, wide
bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods. The market for senior
loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial
increase or decrease in interest rates. This could result in increased
volatility in the market and in a trust's net asset value.


If legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional
requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make
loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions, the availability of
senior loans for investment may be adversely affected. In addition, such
requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for
certain borrowers. This would increase the risk of default. If legislation or
federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior
loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior
loans to increased regulatory scrutiny, financial institutions may determine to
sell such senior loans. Such sales could result in depressed prices.  The price
for the senior loan may be adversely affected if sold at a time when a financial
institution is engaging in such a sale.


Some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court, pursuant to
fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws, could subordinate the senior loans
to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other
action detrimental to lenders. Such court action could under certain
circumstances include invalidation of senior loans. Any lender, which could
include a fund held by a trust, is subject to the risk that a court could find
the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common
laws of tort or contracts or anti-fraud provisions of certain securities laws
for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms
of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral
underlying the senior loan.

FLOATING RATE INSTRUMENTS.  A floating rate security is an instrument in
which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates on a periodic basis
based upon changes in a benchmark, often related to interest rates.  As a
result, the yield on such a security will generally decline with negative
changes to the benchmark, causing an investor to experience a reduction in the
income it receives from such securities.  A sudden and significant increase in
the applicable benchmark may increase the risk of payment defaults and cause a
decline in the value of the security.


ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.  Asset-backed securities ("ABS") are securities
backed by pools of loans or other receivables.  ABS are created from many types
of assets, including auto loans, credit card receivables, home equity loans, and
student loans.  ABS are issued through special purpose vehicles that are
bankruptcy remote from the issuer of the collateral.  The credit quality of an
ABS transaction depends on the performance of the underlying assets.  To protect
ABS investors from the possibility that some borrowers could miss payments or
even default on their loans, ABS include various forms of credit enhancement.
Some ABS, particularly home equity loan transactions, are subject to interest
rate risk and prepayment risk.  A change in interest rates can affect the pace
of payments on the underlying loans, which in turn, affects total return on the
securities.  ABS also carry credit or default risk.  If many borrowers on the
underlying loans default, losses could exceed the credit enhancement level and
result in losses to investors in an ABS transaction.  Finally, ABS have
structure risk due to a unique characteristic known as early amortization, or
early payout, risk.  Built into the structure of most ABS are triggers for early
payout, designed to protect investors from losses.  These triggers are unique to
each transaction and can include: a big rise in defaults on the underlying
loans, a sharp drop in the credit enhancement level, or even the bankruptcy of
the originator.  Once early amortization begins, all incoming loan payments
(after expenses are paid) are used to pay investors as quickly as possible based
upon a predetermined priority of payment.


MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.  Mortgage-backed securities are a type of ABS
representing direct or indirect participations in, or are secured by and payable
from, mortgage loans secured by real property and can include single- and
multi-class pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.
Mortgage-backed securities are based on different types of mortgages, including
those on commercial real estate or residential properties.  These securities
often have stated maturities of up to thirty years when they are issued,
depending upon the length of the mortgages underlying the securities.  In
practice, however, unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on
the underlying mortgages may make the securities' effective maturity shorter
than this.  Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgage-backed
securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates, and may
reduce the market value of the securities.  In addition, mortgage-backed
securities are subject to prepayment risk, the risk that borrowers may pay off
their mortgages sooner than expected, particularly when interest rates decline.


SOVEREIGN DEBT.  Sovereign debt instruments are subject to the risk that a
governmental entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on
its sovereign debt, due, for example, to cash flow problems, insufficient
foreign currency reserves, political considerations, the relative size of the
governmental entity's debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to
put in place required economic reforms.  If a governmental entity defaults, it
may ask for more time in which to pay or for further loans.  There is no legal
process for collecting


-29-





sovereign debt that a government does not pay nor are there bankruptcy
proceedings through which all or part of the sovereign debt that a governmental
entity has not repaid may be collected.


U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS RISK.  Obligations of U.S. government agencies,
authorities, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically
involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity.  However, not all
U.S. government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States.  Obligations of certain agencies, authorities, instrumentalities and
sponsored enterprises of the U.S. government are backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States (e.g., the Government National Mortgage
Association); other obligations are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow
from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., the Federal Home Loan Banks) and others are
supported by the discretionary authority of the U.S. government to purchase an
agency's obligations.  Still others are backed only by the credit of the agency,
authority, instrumentality or sponsored enterprise issuing the obligation.  No
assurance can be given that the U.S. government would provide financial support
to any of these entities if it is not obligated to do so by law.


MONEY MARKET SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by a trust may invest in money
market securities.  If market conditions improve while a fund has temporarily
invested some or all of its assets in high quality money market securities, this
strategy could result in reducing the potential gain from the market upswing,
thus reducing a fund's opportunity to achieve its investment objective.


DERIVATIVES RISK.  Certain funds held by a trust may engage in transactions
in derivatives.  Derivatives are subject to counterparty risk which is the risk
that the other party in a transaction may be unable or unwilling to meet
obligations when due.  Use of derivatives may increase volatility of a fund and
reduce returns.  Fluctuations in the value of derivatives may not correspond
with fluctuations of underlying exposures.  Unanticipated market movements could
result in significant losses on derivative positions including greater losses
than amounts originally invested and potentially unlimited losses in the case of
certain derivatives.  There are no assurances that there will be a secondary
market available in any derivative position which could result in illiquidity
and the inability of a fund to liquidate or terminate positions as valued.
Valuation of derivative positions may be difficult and increase during times of
market turmoil.  Certain derivatives may be used as a hedge against other
securities positions, however, hedging can be subject to the risk of imperfect
alignment and there are no assurances that a hedge will be achieved as intended
which can pose significant loss to a fund.  Recent legislation has called for
significant increases to the regulation of the derivatives market.  Regulatory
changes and rulemaking is ongoing and the full impact may not be known for some
time.  This increased regulation may make derivatives more costly, limit the
availability of derivatives or otherwise adversely affect the value or
performance of derivatives.  Examples of increased regulation include, but are
not limited to, the imposition of clearing and reporting requirements on
transactions that fall within the definition of "swap" and "security-based
swap," increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements, changing definitional
and registration requirements, and changes to the way that funds' use of
derivatives is regulated.  No one can predict the effects of any new
governmental regulation that may be implemented on the ability of a fund to use
any financial derivative product, and there can be no assurance that any new
governmental regulation will not adversely affect a fund's ability to achieve
its investment objective.  The federal income


-30-





tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in
the asset that a derivative provides exposure to, which may adversely impact the
timing, character and amount of income a fund realizes from its investment.  The
tax treatment of certain derivatives is unsettled and may be subject to future
legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements.


OPTIONS.  A trust may hold a fund or funds that write (sell) or purchase
options as part of its investment strategy.  In addition to general risks
associated with derivatives described above, options are considered speculative.
When a fund purchases an option, it may lose the premium paid for it if the
price of the underlying security or other assets decreases or remains the same
(in the case of a call option) or increases or remains the same (in the case of
a put option).  If a put or call option purchased by a fund were permitted to
expire without being sold or exercised, its premium would represent a loss to a
fund.  To the extent that a fund writes or sells an option, if the decline or
increase in the underlying asset is significantly below or above the exercise
price of the written option, a fund could experience substantial and potentially
unlimited losses.


There can be no assurance that a liquid market for the options will exist
when a fund seeks to close out an option position. Reasons for the absence of a
liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following: (i) there may be
insufficient trading interest in certain options; (ii) restrictions may be
imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both;

(iii) trading halts, suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with
respect to particular classes or series of options; (iv) unusual or unforeseen
of an exchange or The Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC") may not at all times
be adequate to handle current trading volume; or (vi) one or more exchanges
could, for economic or other reasons, decide or be compelled at some future date
to discontinue the trading of options (or a particular class or series of
options). If trading were discontinued, the secondary market on that exchange
(or in that class or series of options) would cease to exist. However,
outstanding options on that exchange that had been issued by the OCC as a result
of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with
their terms. A fund's ability to terminate over-the-counter options is more
limited than with exchange-traded options and may involve the risk that broker-
dealers participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations.
If a fund were unable to close out a covered call option that it had written

(sold) on a security, it would not be able to sell the underlying security
unless the option expired without exercise.


The hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which
the underlying securities are traded. To the extent that the options markets
close before the markets for the underlying securities, significant price and
rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected
in the options markets. Additionally, the exercise price of an option may be
adjusted downward before the option's expiration as a result of the occurrence
of certain corporate events affecting the underlying equity security, such as
extraordinary dividends, stock splits, merger or other extraordinary
distributions or events. In certain circumstances, a reduction in the exercise
price of an option could reduce a fund's capital appreciation potential on the
underlying security.


To the extent that a fund purchases options pursuant to a hedging strategy,
the fund will be subject to the following additional risks. If a put or call
option purchased by a fund is not sold when it has remaining value, and if the
market price of the underlying security remains equal to


-31-





or greater than the exercise price (in the case of a put), or remains less than
or equal to the exercise price (in the case of a call), the fund will lose its
entire investment in the option. Also, where a put or call option on a
particular security is purchased to hedge against price movements in a related
security, the price of the put or call option may move more or less than the
price of the related security. If restrictions on exercise were imposed, a fund
might be unable to exercise an option it had purchased. If a fund were unable to
close out an option that it had purchased on a security, it would have to
exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option may expire
worthless.


The writing (selling) and purchase of options is a highly specialized
activity which involves investment techniques and risks different from those
associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The successful use
of options depends in part on the ability of a fund's adviser to predict future
price fluctuations and, for hedging transactions, the degree of correlation
between the options and securities or currency markets.


If a fund employs a covered call strategy, a fund will generally write

(sell) call options on a significant portion of the fund's managed assets. These
call options will give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to
purchase a security from the fund at the strike price on or prior to the
option's expiration date. The ability to successfully implement the fund's
investment strategy depends on the fund adviser's ability to predict pertinent
market movements, which cannot be assured. Thus, the use of options may require
a fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other
than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can
realize on an investment, or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might
otherwise sell. The writer (seller) of an option has no control over the time
when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer (seller) of the
option. Once an option writer (seller) has received an exercise notice, it
cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its
obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the
exercise price. As the writer (seller) of a covered call option, a fund forgoes,
during the option's life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market
value of the security underlying the call option above the sum of the premium
and the strike price of the call option, but has retained the risk of loss
should the price of the underlying security decline. The value of the options
written (sold) by a fund will be affected by changes in the value and dividend
rates of the underlying equity securities, an increase in interest rates,
changes in the actual or perceived volatility of securities markets and the
underlying securities and the remaining time to the options' expirations. The
value of the options may also be adversely affected if the market for the
options becomes less liquid or smaller.


An option is generally considered "covered" if a fund owns the security
underlying the call option or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire
that security without additional cash consideration (or, if required, liquid
cash or other assets are segregated by the fund) upon conversion or exchange of
other securities held by the fund. In certain cases, a call option may also be
considered covered if a fund holds a call option on the same security as the
call option written (sold) provided that certain conditions are met.  By writing
(selling) covered call options, a fund generally seeks to generate income, in
the form of the premiums received for writing (selling) the call options.
Investment income paid by a fund to its shareholders (such as a trust) may be
derived primarily from the premiums it receives from writing (selling) call
options and,


-32-





to a lesser extent, from the dividends and interest it receives from the equity
securities or other investments held in the fund's portfolio and short-term
gains thereon. Premiums from writing (selling) call options and dividends and
interest payments made by the securities in a fund's portfolio can vary widely
over time.


SWAPS.  Certain funds held by a trust may invest in swaps.  In addition to
general risks associated with derivatives described above, swap agreements
involve the risk that the party with whom a fund has entered into the swap will
default on its obligation to pay a fund and the risk that a fund will not be
able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.  Swaps
entered into by a fund may include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps,
total return swaps and/or credit default swaps.  In an interest rate swap
transaction, two parties exchange rights to receive interest payments, such as
exchanging the right to receive floating rate payments based on a reference
interest rate for the right to receive fixed rate payments.  In addition to the
general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above, interest
rate swaps are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.  In a total return
swap transaction, one party agrees to pay another party an amount equal to the
total return on a reference asset during a specified period of time in return
for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or on the total
return from a different reference asset.  In addition to the general risks
associated with derivatives and swaps described above, total return swaps could
result in losses if the reference asset does not perform as anticipated and
these swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses.  In a credit default
swap transaction, one party makes one or more payments over the term of the
contract to the counterparty, provided that no event of default with respect to
a specific obligation or issuer has occurred.  In return, upon any event of
default, such party would receive from the counterparty a payment equal to the
par (or other agreed-upon) value of such specified obligation.  In addition to
general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above, credit
default swaps involve special risks because they are difficult to value, are
highly susceptible to liquidity and credit risk, and generally pay a return to
the party that has paid the premium only in the event of an actual default by
the issuer of the underlying obligation (as opposed to a credit downgrade or
other indication of financial difficulty).


FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.  Certain funds held by a trust
may engage in forward foreign currency exchange transactions.  Forward foreign
exchange transactions are contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of a
specified currency or multinational currency unit at a price and future date set
at the time of the contract.  Forward foreign currency exchange contracts do not
eliminate fluctuations in the value of non-U.S. securities but rather allow a
fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time.  This
strategy can have the effect of reducing returns and minimizing opportunities
for gain.


INDEXED AND INVERSE SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by a trust may invest
in indexed and inverse securities.  In addition to general risks associated with
derivatives described above, indexed and inverse securities are subject to risk
with respect to the value of the particular index.  These securities are subject
to leverage risk and correlation risk.  Certain indexed and inverse securities
have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates or index levels than other
securities, and a fund's investment in such instruments may decline
significantly in value if interest rates or index levels move in a way a fund's
management does not anticipate.


-33-





FUTURES.  Certain funds held by a trust may engage in futures transactions.
In addition to general risks associated with derivatives described above, the
primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options are

(a) the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the
instruments held by a fund and the price of the futures contract or option;

(b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the
resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired; (c) losses caused
by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d) the
investment adviser's inability to predict correctly the direction of securities
prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic factors; and

(e) the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its
obligations.  While futures contracts are generally liquid instruments, under
certain market conditions they may become illiquid.  Futures exchanges may
impose daily or intra-day price change limits and/or limit the volume of
trading.  Additionally, government regulation may further reduce liquidity
through similar trading restrictions.


REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RISK.  A repurchase agreement is a form of short-term
borrowing where a dealer sells securities to investors (usually on an overnight
basis) and buys them back the following day.  If the other party to a repurchase
agreement defaults on its obligation under such agreement, a fund held by a
trust may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights
under the agreement.  If the seller fails to repurchase the security under a
repurchase agreement and the market value of such security declines, such fund
may lose money.


SHORT SALES RISK.  Certain funds held by a trust may engage in short sales.
Because making short sales in securities that it does not own exposes a fund to
the risks associated with those securities, such short sales involve speculative
exposure risk.  A fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the
price of the security increases between the date of the short sale and the date
on which such fund replaces the security sold short.  A fund will realize a gain
if the security declines in price between those dates.  As a result, if a fund
makes short sales in securities that increase in value, it will likely
underperform similar funds that do not make short sales in securities they do
not own.  There can be no assurance that a fund will be able to close out a
short sale position at any particular time or at an acceptable price.  Although
a fund's gain is limited to the amount at which it sold a security short, its
potential loss is limited only by the maximum attainable price of the security,
less the price at which the security was sold.  Short sale transactions involve
leverage because they can provide investment exposure in an amount exceeding the
initial investment.  A fund may also pay transaction costs and borrowing fees in
connection with short sales.


COMMODITIES.  Certain funds held by a trust may have exposure to the
commodities market.  This exposure could expose such funds and to greater
volatility than investment in other securities.  The value of investments
providing commodity exposure may be affected by changes in overall market
movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors
affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather,
embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory
developments.


-34-





CONCENTRATION RISK.  Concentration risk is the risk that the value of a
trust may be more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a
particular sector because the trust provides exposure to investments
concentrated within a particular sector or sectors.


CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY AND CONSUMER STAPLES SECTORS.  The profitability of
companies that manufacture or sell consumer products or provide consumer
services will be affected by various factors including the general state of the
economy and consumer spending trends. In the past, there have been major changes
in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the
major corporations involved in the retail industry, particularly the department
store segment. The continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the
industry's ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social
conditions, to attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion.
Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic climate
with the consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable trends in
unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth
could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer
confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending habits. In addition,
competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for
investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control
inventory, to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of
sales campaigns. Increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an
adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the retail industry,
competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging consumer tastes
and other factors. Many retailers are involved in entering global markets which
entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies, difficulty in
adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs.


ENERGY SECTOR.  Energy companies may include but are not limited to
companies involved in: production, generation, transmission, marketing, control,
or measurement of energy; the provision of component parts or services to
companies engaged in the above activities; energy research or experimentation;
and environmental activities related to the solution of energy problems, such as
energy conservation and pollution control.


The securities of companies in the energy field are subject to changes in
value and dividend yield which depend, to a large extent, on the price and
supply of energy fuels. Swift price and supply fluctuations may be caused by
events relating to international politics, energy conservation, the success of
exploration projects, and tax and other regulatory policies of various
governments. As a result of the foregoing, the securities issued by energy
companies may be subject to rapid price volatility.


Any future scientific advances concerning new sources of energy and fuels
or legislative changes relating to the energy sector or the environment could
have a negative impact on the petroleum products sector. While legislation has
been enacted to deregulate certain aspects of the oil sector, no assurances can
be given that new or additional regulations will not be adopted. Each of the
problems referred to could adversely affect the financial stability of the
issuers of any petroleum sector securities.


-35-





FINANCIALS SECTOR.  Banks and their holding companies are especially
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates;
portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential
real estate loans; and competition from new entrants in their fields of
business.  In addition, banks and their holding companies are extensively
regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by
increased regulations.  Banks will face increased competition from
nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley financial services overhaul legislation, permit new entrants to offer
various financial products.  Technological advances such as the Internet allow
these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more
efficient use of customer data.  Banks are already facing tremendous pressure
from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the
competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks.


Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries may engage in
administrative and legislative action intended to address both short- and long-
term difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets, mortgage
backed securities, the financial services industry and the broader economy.
These government actions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on
investment activities; increased oversight, regulation and involvement in
financial services company practices; adjustments to capital requirements; the
acquisition of interests in and the extension of credit to private entities; and
increased investigation efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in
the financial service industry.  No one can predict any action that might be
taken or the effect any action or inaction will have.  It is possible that any
actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the
state of these difficulties as intended.  No one can predict the impact that the
difficulties will have on the economy, generally or financial services
companies.  The difficulties and corresponding government action or inaction may
have far reaching consequences and your investment may be adversely affected by
such developments.


Banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal
regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation
as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on
the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore,
bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their
supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the
permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant
risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit
insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital
requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums
required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a
company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental
regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their
holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in the securities
issued by such institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have
undergone substantial change in the past, including, but not limited to the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, enacted in August
1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of


-36-





1991; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under these
laws.


Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.  Adverse changes
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,
competitive pressures, including increased competition from new and existing
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and self-
regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the
interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect the
stock prices of such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather
catastrophes or other natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client
mergers. Individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve
inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and profitability. In
addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies continue to shrink
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as: the
inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property-liability loss
reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established
loss reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on results of
operations and financial condition; the fact that insurance companies have
experienced, and can be expected in the future to experience, catastrophic
losses, which could have a material adverse impact on their financial
conditions, results of operations and cash flow; the inherent uncertainty in the
process of establishing property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss
payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices; the need for
insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of
statutory capital and surplus, particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by
rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to
maintain acceptable financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings; the
extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject,
and various regulatory and other legal


-37-





actions; the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the attractiveness
of certain of its products; and the uncertainty involved in estimating the
availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered
or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to
regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance
regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing
on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of
new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated
the condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine
whether to promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to
predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the
nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any,
such legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-
admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


HEALTH CARE SECTOR.  Healthcare companies involved in advanced medical
devices and instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital
management/health services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to
their sector of the healthcare field.  These companies are subject to
governmental regulation of their products and services, a factor which could
have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability
of such products or services.  Furthermore, such companies face the risk of
increasing competition from new products or services, generic drug sales,
termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the
risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete.  The
research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and
include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product
will ever come to market.  Many of these companies may have losses and not offer
certain products for several years.  Such companies may also have persistent
losses during a new product's transition from development to production, and
revenue patterns may be erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may
be affected by events and conditions including, among other things, demand for
services, the ability of the facility to provide the services required,
physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition
with other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice
insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial
assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar
third-party payor programs.


Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time.  These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might


-38-





include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), national health insurance
incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services, tax
incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion
of prepaid healthcare plans.


INDUSTRIALS SECTOR.  General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In
addition, capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall
capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and ecommerce initiatives.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny
for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of
their financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar
scrutiny.


Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to
their individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject
to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel.


INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.  Information technology companies generally
include companies involved in the development, design, manufacture and sale of
computers and peripherals, software and services, data networking and
communications equipment, internet access and information providers,
semiconductors and semiconductor equipment and other related products, systems
and services. The market for these products, especially those specifically
related to the internet, may be characterized by rapidly changing technology,
product obsolescence, cyclical markets, evolving industry standards and frequent
new product introductions. The success of companies in this sector depends, in
substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of new products. An
unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting a company's
products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could
have a material adverse effect on an issuer's operating results. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that any particular company will be able to respond in
a timely manner to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.


Factors such as announcements of new products or development of new
technologies and general conditions of the industry have caused and are likely
to cause the market price of high-technology common stocks to fluctuate
substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating
performance of such companies. Such market volatility may adversely affect the
market price of shares of these companies. Some key components of certain
products of technology issuers are currently available only from single sources.


There can be no assurance that in the future suppliers will be able to meet
the demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner. Accordingly, an
issuer's operating results and customer relationships could be adversely
affected by either an increase in price for, or an


-39-





interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally, many
technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous industry standards. Any failure to comply with
such standards may result in a significant loss or reduction of sales. Because
many products and technologies of technology companies are incorporated into
other related products, such companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of the personal computer, electronics and telecommunications
industries. There can be no assurance that these customers will place additional
orders, or that an issuer will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
from other customers. Similarly, the success of certain technology companies is
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies.
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such
customers could have a material adverse impact on companies in this sector.


Many technology companies rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary
rights in their products and technologies. There can be no assurance that the
steps taken to protect proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent
misappropriation of technology or that competitors will not independently
develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to an
issuer's technology. In addition, due to the increasing public use of the
internet, it is possible that other laws and regulations may be adopted to
address issues such as privacy, pricing, characteristics, and quality of
internet products and services. The adoption of any such laws could have a
material adverse impact on the issuers of securities in the information
technology sector.


Like many areas of technology, the semiconductor business environment is
highly competitive, notoriously cyclical and subject to rapid and often
unanticipated change. Recent industry downturns have resulted, in part, from
weak pricing, persistent overcapacity, slowdown in Asian demand and a shift in
retail personal computer sales toward the low-end segment. Industry growth is
dependent upon several factors, including: the rate of global economic
expansion; demand for products such as personal computers and networking and
communications equipment; excess productive capacity and the resultant effect on
pricing; and the rate of growth in the market for low-priced personal computers.


MATERIALS SECTOR.  Companies in the basic materials sector are engaged in
the manufacture, mining, processing, or distribution of raw materials and
intermediate goods used in the industrial sector. These may include materials
and products such as chemicals, commodities, forestry products, paper products,
copper, iron ore, nickel, steel, aluminum, precious metals, textiles, cement,
and gypsum. Basic materials companies may be affected by the volatility of
commodity prices, exchange rates, import controls, worldwide competition,
depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution
control devices. In addition, they may be adversely affected by technical
progress, labor relations, and governmental regulation. These companies are also
at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of
industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or
economic downturns, which may lead to poor investment returns.


TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES SECTOR.  General risks of telecommunication
services companies include rapidly changing technology, rapid product
obsolescence, loss of patent


-40-





protection, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent
new product introductions. Certain communications/bandwidth companies are
subject to substantial governmental regulation, which among other things,
regulates permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may
offer. Such companies can also be negatively impacted by any failure to obtain,
or delays in obtaining, financial or regulatory approval for new products or
services. Companies in this sector are subject to fierce competition for market
share from existing competitors and new market entrants. Such competitive
pressures are intense and communications stocks can experience extreme
volatility.


Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash
flows and heavy debt burdens due to the need to commit substantial capital to
meet increasing competition, particularly in formulating new products and
services using new technology. Technological innovations may also make the
existing products and services of telecommunications companies obsolete. In
addition, companies in this sector can be impacted by a lack of investor or
consumer acceptance of new products, changing consumer preferences and lack of
standardization or compatibility with existing technologies making
implementation of new products more difficult.


UTILITIES SECTOR.  General problems of utility companies include risks of
increases in fuel and other operating costs; restrictions on operations and
increased costs and delays as a result of environmental, nuclear safety and
other regulations; regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing
wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer; energy conservation;
technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment or
products obsolete; the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty
in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors; natural or
manmade disasters; difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital;
the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation; difficulties
of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities; and
increased competition. In addition, taxes, government regulation, international
politics, price and supply fluctuations, and volatile interest rates and energy
conservation may cause difficulties for utilities. All of such issuers
experience certain of these problems to varying degrees.


CALIFORNIA.  The information provided below is only a brief summary of the
complex factors affecting the financial situation in California and is derived
from sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be
accurate.  Except where otherwise indicated, the information is based on
California's 2014-15 fiscal year running from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015.  No
independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of
the following information. It is based in part on information obtained from
various state and local agencies in California or contained in official
statements for various California municipal obligations.


Economic Outlook.  The U.S. economy completed its sixth year of recovery as
California ended its fiscal year on June 30, 2015.  California's income growth
outperformed that of the nation as a whole during the 2014-2015 fiscal year.
The state's total personal income increased 5.5% during the 2014-15 fiscal year,
compared to the 4.6% increase the nation experienced.  Auto registrations
increased by 9.9% in California for a total of 1.9 million registered vehicles
for the 2014-15 fiscal year.  The state's real estate market showed signs of
continued growth at the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year compared to the market a
year earlier.  As of June 2015, prices


-41-





for existing single-family homes were 7.0% higher and sales were up 11% compared
to the prior year. Homebuilding continued in California at an accelerated rate,
with permits issued during the 2014-2015 fiscal year increasing by 10% to nearly
94,000 units.  Nonresidential construction increased by 4.1%, with the value of
nonresidential permits increasing to $23.5 billion.


California's labor market continued to add jobs during the 2014-2015 fiscal
year.  Total employment for June 2015 rose to 17.8 million jobs, a gain of more
than 481,000 jobs from June 2014.  Mirroring that increase, California's
unemployment rate fell from 7.5% at June 2014 to 6.3% at June 2015.


Net Assets.  The primary government's net position as of the end of the
2014-15 fiscal year was a net deficit position of $41 billion.  The total net
deficit position was reduced by $103.0 billion for net investment in capital
assets and by $31.1 billion for restricted net position, yielding a negative
unrestricted net position of $175.1 billion.  Restricted net position is
dedicated for specified uses and is not available to fund current activities.
More than half of the negative $175.1 billion consisted of unfunded, employee-
related, long-term liabilities that are recognized as soon as an obligation has
been incurred, even though payment will occur over many future periods. Another
38.3% ($67.1 billion) consist of outstanding bonded debt issued to build capital
assets for school districts and other local governmental entities.  The bonded
debt reduced the unrestricted net position; however, local governments, not the
state, own the capital assets that would offset this reduction.


The primary government's combined net deficit position (governmental and
business-type activities) as originally reported at June 30, 2014, decreased by
$48.3 (or more than 659%) to a negative $41.0 billion a year later, but
increased $15.8 billion (27.8%) when adjusted for restatements.


California General Fund.  The state's main operating fund (the "California
General Fund") ended the 2014-15 fiscal year with assets of $22.2 billion;
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources of $24.4 billion; and non-
spendable, restricted, and committed fund balances of $53 million, $2.3 billion,
and $103 million, respectively, leaving the California General Fund with a
negative unassigned fund balance of $4.7 billion.  Total assets of the
California General Fund increased by $2.8 billion (14.3%) over the 2013-14
fiscal year, while the total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources of
the California General Fund decreased by $2.4 billion (9.1%).  Total net fund
deficit balance decreased by $5.2 billion (70.1%).


As of the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year, the California General Fund had
an excess of revenues over expenditures of $9.6 billion ($116.8 billion in
revenues and $107.2 billion in expenditures).  Approximately $111.3 billion
(95.3%) of California General Fund revenue was derived from the state's largest
three taxes--personal income taxes ($76.9 billion), sales and use taxes ($23.6
billion), and corporation taxes ($10.8 billion).  As a result of fund
classifications made to comply with governmental accounting standards, a total
of $336 million in revenue, essentially all from unemployment programs, was
included in the California General Fund.  These revenues were not considered
California General Fund revenues for any budgetary purposes or for the state's
"Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Report."  During the 2014-15 fiscal year, total
California General Fund revenue increased by $12.6 billion (12.1%).  The
increase


-42-





was a result of increases in personal income taxes of $9.3 billion (13.8%),
sales and use taxes of $1.4 billion (6.1%), and corporation taxes of $1.5
billion (16.6%).


California General Fund expenditures increased by $11.8 billion (12.4%)
during the 2014-15 fiscal year.  The largest increases were in education and
general government expenditures, which were up $9.7 billion and $1 billion,
respectively.  The California General Fund's deficit for the 2014-15 fiscal year
was $2.2 billion, an improvement of $5.2 billion from the prior year's restated
ending fund deficit of $7.4 billion.


Budget Outlook.  California enacted Budget Act of 2015 (the "California
Budget Act") for the 2014-15 fiscal year on June 24, 2015.  The California
Budget Act appropriated $167.6 billion: $115.4 billion from the California
General Fund, $45.7 billion from special funds and $6.5 billion from bond funds.
The California General Fund's budgeted expenditures increased $896 million
(0.8%) over the previous year's California General Fund budget.  The California
Budget Act projected California General Fund's revenue to be $115.0 billion
after a projected $1.9 billion transfer to the "Budget Stabilization Account."
California General Fund revenue comes predominantly from taxes, personal income
taxes were projected to provide 66.5% of total revenue for 2015-16 fiscal year.
California's major taxes (personal income, sales and use, and corporation taxes)
were projected to supply approximately 96.9% of the California General Fund's
resources in the 2015-16 fiscal year.


The spending plan for 2015-2016 fiscal year implemented the first year of
Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, which uses spikes in capital
gains to save money for the next recession and to pay down California's debts
and unfunded liabilities.  Despite the projected $1.9 billion transfer to the
Budget Stabilization Account and $1.9 billion allocated for debt reduction,
including special fund loan repayments and a partial settle-up of Proposition 98
underfunding, the budget projected a surplus in the California General Fund for
the fourth consecutive year.  The California General Fund is projected to end
the 2015-2016 fiscal year with $4.6 billion in total reserves--$3.5 billion in
the Budget Stabilization Account and $1.1 billion reserved for economic
uncertainties.


Governor Brown released his proposed 2016-17 fiscal year budget on January
7, 2016.  The budget restores some previous budget cuts and expands services,
but continues to place strong emphasis on building reserves, paying down
existing obligations, and restoring and upgrading California's infrastructure.
Although a strengthening economy continues to push revenues higher, the
Governor's budget includes provisions for the next recession, as history has
shown that the California General Fund's major revenue source, personal income
taxes, drops precipitously during economic downturns.  The budget allocated a
significant portion of discretionary resources to increasing total reserves
beyond constitutional funding requirements such as those required by Proposition
2 and Proposition 98.  The budget projects total reserves of $10.2 billion by
the end of the 2016-17 fiscal year--$6 billion in the Budget Stabilization
Account required under Proposition 2 and $2.2 billion in the California General
Fund's reserve for economic uncertainties, and an additional optional reserve of
$2.0 billion.  In addition to the required transfer to the Budget Stabilization
Account, Proposition 2 requires an equivalent amount be used to pay down
existing debts and reduce unfunded liabilities in excess of current base
amounts.  During the 2016-17 fiscal year, Governor Brown proposes to spend a
total of $1.6


-43-





billion to repay some of the California General Fund's loans from special funds
and transportation projects, to partially settle-up previous Proposition 98
underfunding, and to reduce some of the University of California employee
pension liabilities.


The 2016-17 governor's budget projects that the California General Fund
revenues and transfers to be $120.6 billion and expenditures to be $122.6
billion, with an estimated $3.2 billion year-end balance, which includes the
$2.2 billion reserve for economic uncertainties.  In the proposed budget, the
California General Fund began fiscal year 2015-16 with a surplus balance of $3.7
billion; it is projected to begin fiscal year 2016-17 with a surplus of
approximately $5.2 billion.  The 2016-17 governor's budget estimated California
General Fund revenues and transfers to be 2.6% more than the revised 2015-16
estimate of $117.5 billion, while the fiscal year 2016-17 expenditures are
estimated to be 5.6% greater than the revised 2015-16 estimate of $116.1
billion.


Capital Assets.  The state's investment in capital assets for its
governmental and business-type activities as of the end of the 2014-15 fiscal
year amounted to $132.4 billion (net of accumulated depreciation/amortization).
The state's capital assets include land, state highway infrastructure,
collections, buildings and other depreciable property, intangible assets, and
construction in progress.  The buildings and other depreciable property account
includes buildings, improvements other than buildings, equipment, certain
infrastructure assets, certain books, and other capitalized and depreciable
property.  Intangible assets include computer software, land use rights,
patents, copyrights, and trademarks.  Infrastructure assets are items that
normally are immovable, such as roads and bridges, and can be preserved for a
greater number of years than can most capital assets.


As of the end of 2014-15 fiscal year, the state's capital assets increased
$7.3 billion (5.8%) over the prior fiscal year.  The majority of this increase
occurred in state highway infrastructure, buildings and other depreciable
property, and construction/development in progress.  Included in the capital
assets increase is a $3.6 billion beginning balance restatement, primarily for
understated state highway infrastructure construction in progress.


Debt Administration. As of the end of 2014-15 fiscal year, the primary
government had total bonded debt outstanding of $112.2 billion.  Of this amount,
$81.1 billion (72.3%) represents general obligation bonds, which are backed by
the full faith and credit of the state.  Included in the $81.1 billion of
general obligation bonds is $944 million of Economic Recovery Bonds that are
secured by a pledge of revenues derived from dedicated sales and use taxes and
will be fully paid during fiscal year 2015-2016.  As of the end of 2014-15
fiscal year, the current portion of general obligation bonds outstanding was
$3.0 billion and the long-term portion was $78.1 billion.  The remaining $31.1
billion (27.7%) of bonded debt outstanding represents revenue bonds, which are
secured solely by specified revenue sources.  As of the end of 2014-15 fiscal
year, the portion of revenue bonds outstanding was $1.7 billion and the long-
term portion was $29.4 billion.  During the 2014-15 fiscal year, the state
issued $6.6 billion in new general obligation bonds for children's hospitals,
public primary, secondary, community college and university education
facilities, highway safety, traffic reduction, air quality and port security,
transportation, housing and emergency shelters, local and passenger rail
projects, safe drinking water, water quality and supply, flood control, river
and coastal protection, medical research,


-44-





earthquake safety and public building rehabilitation, veteran's homes, high-
speed passenger train projects, and to refund previously outstanding general
obligation bonds and commercial paper.


Budgetary Control.  The California state legislature prepares an annual
budget that contains estimates of revenues and expenditures for the ensuing
fiscal year.  This budget is the result of negotiations between the governor and
the California legislature. Throughout the fiscal year, adjustments in the form
of budget revisions, executive orders, and financial legislation agreed to by
the governor and the California legislature are made to the budget.  The
California State Controller's Office ("State Controller's Office") is
statutorily responsible for control over revenues due the primary government and
for expenditures of each appropriation contained in the budget.  Budgeted
appropriations are the expenditure authorizations that allow state agencies to
purchase or create liabilities for goods and services.


The state's accounting system provides the State Controller's Office with a
centrally-controlled record system to fully account for each budgeted
appropriation, including its unexpended balance, and for all cash receipts and
disbursements.  The accounting system is decentralized, meaning the detail of
each control account is maintained by each state agency. During the fiscal year,
the control accounts and the agency accounts are maintained and reconciled on a
cash basis.  At the end of the fiscal year, each agency prepares annual accrual
reports for receivables and payables.  The State Controller's Office combines
its control account balances with the agency accrual reports to prepare
California's Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Report.  State laws and regulations
that, in some cases, do not fully agree with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principals, govern the methods of accounting for expenditures and revenues in
these reports.


Cash Management.  As of the end of the 2014-2015 fiscal year, there were no
revenue anticipation notes outstanding.


Risk Management.  The primary government has elected, with a few
exceptions, to be self-insured against loss or liability.  The primary
government generally does not maintain reserves.  Losses are covered by
appropriations from each fund responsible for payment in the year in which the
payment occurs.  The state has been permissively self-insured and barring any
extraordinary catastrophic event, the potential amount of loss faced by the
state is not considered material in relation to the primary government's
financial position.  Generally, the exceptions are when a bond resolution or a
contract requires the primary government to purchase commercial insurance for
coverage against property loss or liability.  There have been no significant
reductions in insurance coverage in 2015 from the prior year.  In addition, no
insurance settlement from 2012 to 2015 has exceeded insurance coverage.  All
claim payments are on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, with workers' compensation
benefits for self-insured agencies initially being paid by California's "State
Compensation Insurance Fund."


The discounted liability for unpaid self-insurance claims of the primary
government was estimated to be $3.8 billion as of the end of the 2014-15 fiscal
year.  This estimate was based primarily on actuarial reviews of the state's
workers' compensation program and included indemnity payments to claimants, as
well as all other costs of providing workers' compensation benefits, such as
medical care and rehabilitation.  The estimate also included the liability for


-45-





unpaid services fees, industrial disability leave benefits, and incurred-but-
not-reported amounts.  The estimated total liability of approximately $5.4
billion was discounted to $3.8 billion using a 3.5% interest rate.  Of the
total, $392 million was reported as a current liability, of which $263 million
was included in the California General Fund, $127 million in the special revenue
funds, and $2 million in the internal service funds.  The remaining $3.4 billion
was reported as other noncurrent liabilities in the government-wide statement of
net position.


The University of California, a discretely presented component unit, is
self-insured or insured through a wholly-owned captive insurance company for
medical malpractice, workers' compensation, employee health care, and general
liability claims.  These risks are subject to various claim and aggregate
limits, with excess liability coverage provided by an independent insurer.
Liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  These losses include an
estimate for claims that have been incurred but not reported. The estimated
liabilities are based on an independent actuarial determination of the
anticipated future payments, discounted at rates ranging from 2% to 5%.


Ratings.  As of May 6, 2016, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the state of California were rated "AA-" by S&P Global Ratings, a division of
S&P Global, Inc., and "Aa3" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.  Any explanation
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating
agencies.  There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period
of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


Local Issuances.  It should be noted that the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by local California issuers may be unrelated to the
creditworthiness of obligations issued by the state of California, and there is
no obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations
in the event of default.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the
general factors which may impact certain issuers of California bonds and does
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions
to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.  Additionally, many
factors including national economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such bonds, could
affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the state
and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof.  The sponsor is unable
to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect
the issuers of the bonds, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds to pay interest on or principal
of such bonds.


NEW JERSEY.  Economic Outlook.  The State's economic recovery continued,
having added 64,500 new private sector jobs over the course of 2015.  The
increase in payrolls was led by the following sectors - education and health
services; trade, transportation and utilities; and construction.  The State
gained 222,000 new private sector jobs from the start of February 2010 through
the end of 2015.  The State's unemployment rate continued to decline over the
course of 2015, falling from 6.3 percent in December 2014 to 5.1 percent in
December 2015.  The national unemployment rate was 5.0 percent as of December
2015.


-46-





Other measures of the State's economy, also, showed signs of continued
improvement.  The State's housing market continued to expand with existing home
sales in 2015 12.3 percent higher than a year ago and the number of residential
building permits issued by the State 10.4 percent higher than a year ago.  New
car sales in 2015 were 5.2 percent higher than a year ago. Aggregate personal
income, which includes wage income as well as income from other sources such as
assets or transfers, grew for a tenth consecutive quarter and by the third
quarter of 2015 had reached an all-time high.


Revenues and Expenditures.  During Fiscal Year 2015, State revenues,
including transfers, totaled $60.6 billion or an increase of $3.1 billion when
compared to the prior fiscal year.  This increase in total revenues is primarily
attributable to an overall increase in general taxes, primarily the State's
Gross Income Tax and Corporate Business Tax resulting from a strengthening of
the economy.  General taxes totaled $30.8 billion and accounted for 50.8 percent
of total State revenues for Fiscal Year 2015.  The State's Gross Income Tax
totaled $13.3 billion, the Sales and Use Tax totaled $9.1 billion, and the
Corporation Business Tax totaled $2.7 billion.  The State's three major taxes
comprised 81.6 percent of the total general taxes that were collected during
Fiscal Year 2015.  The State's economy showed improvement, as indicated by the
$1.9 billion increase in general taxes when compared to Fiscal Year 2014.


Fiscal Year 2015 expenses totaled $66.7 billion, an increase of $5.5
billion in comparison to the prior fiscal year.  State spending increased by
$3.4 billion in government direction, management, and control mainly due to the
increase in the pension expense based on the requirements of Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Pensions,  $2.0 billion in physical and mental health
predominately attributable to Medicaid expansion, and $778.6 million in
educational, cultural, and intellectual development.


New Jersey General Fund.  The General Fund is the State's chief operating
fund and is the fund into which all State revenues, not otherwise restricted by
statute, are deposited.  The General Fund's ending fund balance totaled $4.5
billion of which $806.4 million represented unassigned fund balance.


On a budgetary basis, general revenues of $35.2 billion were $3.0 billion
lower than the final budget.  The negative variance was the result of unearned
federal and other grant revenues of $2.5 billion and declines of $0.5 billion in
other revenues.  Federal and other grant revenues are not earned unless there
has been a grant award and eligible grant expenses incurred.  To the extent that
federal and grant appropriations are made in anticipation of grant awards and
the incurrence of grant expenditures, grant revenues are budgeted.


Total expenditures were $3.3 billion lower than original appropriations as
set forth in the annual Appropriations Act plus supplemental appropriations
enacted during the fiscal year.  A major cause for under-spending resulted from
the overestimate of federal funds.  This practice allows the State to receive
the maximum federal dollars that become available.  During Fiscal Year 2015, the
State's appropriation of federal funds and other grants exceeded expenditures by
$2.5 billion.  These excess appropriations are available for use in future
years.  From a Fiscal Year 2015 program perspective, under-spending transpired
in community development and


-47-





environmental management ($857.3 million); physical and mental health ($702.7
million); economic planning, development, and security ($496.8 million); public
safety and criminal justice ($444.7 million); government direction, management,
and control ($325.5 million); educational, cultural, and intellectual
development ($186.4 million); special government services ($180.1 million); and
transportation programs ($105.4 million).


Net Assets.  The primary government's assets and deferred outflows of
resources totaled $46.7 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion from the prior
fiscal year.  As of June 30, 2015, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources
exceeded assets and deferred outflows of resources by $113.9 billion.  The
State's unrestricted net position, which represents net assets that have no
statutory commitments and are available for discretionary use, totaled a
negative $127.9 billion.  The negative balance is primarily a result of the
State implementing GASB Statement No. 68  and the State's recognition of other
postemployment benefits under GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial
Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions.
Financing activities that have contributed to the State's negative unrestricted
net position amount include liabilities from pension obligation bonds, the
funding of a portion of local elementary and high school construction, and the
securitization of a major portion of annual tobacco master settlement agreement
receipts with no corresponding assets.


Changes in Net Assets.  The State's Fiscal Year 2015 net position decreased
by $6.1 billion.  Approximately 50.8 percent of the State's total revenues came
from general taxes, while 29.0 percent was derived from operating grants.
Charges for services amounted to 18.2 percent of total revenues, while other
items such as capital grants and miscellaneous revenues accounted for the
remainder.  State expenses cover a range of services.  The largest expense, 24.7
percent, was for educational, cultural, and intellectual development, which
includes approximately $310.1 million disbursed by the New Jersey Schools
Development Authority (a blended component unit) to help finance school
facilities construction.  Government direction, management, and control amounted
to 22.7 percent of total expenses, while physical and mental health amounted to
22.4 percent.  Other major expenditures focused on economic planning,
development, and security and public safety and criminal justice.  During Fiscal
Year 2015, governmental activity expenses exceeded program revenues.  This
imbalance was mainly funded through $32.9 billion of general revenues (mostly
taxes and transfers).  The remaining $6.7 billion resulted in a decrease in net
position.  Offsetting the governmental net position decrease, Business-type
Activities reflected a net position increase of $631.4 million as the
Unemployment Compensation Fund's available resources exceeded the need to pay
claims.


Debt Administration.  As of June 30, 2015, New Jersey's outstanding long-
term obligations for governmental activities totaled $153.5 billion, a $9.9
billion increase over the prior fiscal year.  Of the $9.9 billion increase, $8.5
billion is attributable to increases in the Net Pension Liability and Net Other
Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Obligation.  Long-term bonded obligations totaled
$43.2 billion, while other long-term obligations totaled $110.3 billion.  In
addition, the State has $4.8 billion of legislatively authorized bonding
capacity that has not yet been issued.  As of June 30, 2015, the legislatively
authorized but unissued debt decreased by $2.3 billion.  In fiscal year 2015,
the State implemented GASB Statement No. 68 which required the State to record
its proportionate share of the Net Pension Liability for all State retirement
systems.  Only fiscal year 2014 was restated. Therefore, comparisons to fiscal
years 2011 to 2013


-48-





are incompatible. The State's long-term obligations for the past five fiscal
years are shown below.


Ratings.  As of May 6, 2016 all outstanding general obligation bonds of the
State of New Jersey were rated "A" by S&P Global Ratings a division of S&P
Global, Inc. and "A2" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.  Any explanation
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating
agencies.  There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period
of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


Local Issuances.  It should be noted that the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by local New Jersey issuers may be unrelated to the
creditworthiness of obligations issued by the State of New Jersey, and there is
no obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations
in the event of default.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport
to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which
the issuers of such obligations are subject.  Additionally, many factors
including national economic, social and environmental policies and conditions,
which are not within the control of the issuers of such bonds, could affect or
could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the state and various
agencies and political subdivisions thereof.  The sponsor is unable to predict
whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers
of the bonds, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of
the respective issuers of such bonds to pay interest on or principal of such
bonds.


NEW YORK.  The information provided below is only a brief summary of the
complex factors affecting the financial situation in New York and is derived
from sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be
accurate.  Except where otherwise indicated, the information is based on New
York's 2014-15 fiscal year running from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015.  No
independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of
the following information.  It is based in part on information obtained from
various state and local agencies in New York or contained in official statements
for various New York municipal obligations.


Economic Condition and Outlook.  New York's real gross state product grew
by 2.5% in 2014, driven by strong economic growth in New York City and its
surrounding suburbs.  New York added 143,000 jobs in 2014, and annual growth
rate of 1.7%.  Three-quarters of the job gains during the economic recovery have
been concentrated in New York City and Long Island, with employment in both
areas well above prerecession levels.  While job growth elsewhere in New York
has been weaker, the rest of the state has recovered almost all of the jobs lost
during the recession. The securities industry is important to New York's
economy.  It generated nearly 19% of its tax revenues in the 2014-15 fiscal
year.  The state also benefited from more than $4.9 billion in legal settlements
from financial firms, stemming from violations of New York banking and insurance
laws.


-49-





General Government Results.  An operating surplus of $6.6 billion was
reported in the state's general fund ("New York General Fund") for the 2014-15
fiscal year.  As a result, the New York General Fund had an accumulated fund
balance of $6.1 billion.  The state completed its 2014-15 fiscal year with a
combined governmental funds operating surplus of $6.5 billion as compared to a
combined governmental funds operating surplus in the 2013-14 fiscal year of $1.2
billion.  The combined operating surplus of $6.5 billion for the 2013-14 fiscal
year included an operating surplus in the New York General Fund of $6.6 billion,
in its "Federal Special Revenue Fund" of $3 million, in its "General Debt
Service Fund" of $192 million and $355 million in other governmental funds.


The state's financial position as of the end of 2014-15 fiscal year
included a fund balance of $14.2 billion comprised of $42.1 billion of assets
less liabilities of $25.6 billion and deferred inflows of resources of $2.3
billion.  The governmental funds balance included a $6.1 billion accumulated New
York General Fund balance.


Overall Financial Position. In the 2014-15 fiscal year, the state reported
a net position of $33.3 billion, comprised of $154.6 billion in total assets and
$826 million in deferred outflows of resources, less $121.5 billion in total
liabilities and $555 million in deferred inflows of resources..


Net position reported for governmental activities increased in the 2014-15
fiscal year by $4.7 billion, increasing to $32.5 billion from $27.8 billion in
the 2013-14 fiscal year.  Unrestricted net position for governmental activities,
the part of net position that can be used to finance day-to-day operations
without constraints established by debt covenants, enabling legislation, or
other legal requirements, had a deficit of $39.8 billion at the end of the 2014-
15 fiscal year.


The net position deficit in unrestricted governmental activities, which
decreased by $5 billion in the 2014-15 fiscal year , exists primarily because
New York has issued debt for purposes not resulting in a capital asset related
to New York State governmental activities and the obligation related to other
postemployment benefits ($13.6 billion).  Such outstanding debt included:

securitizing the New York State's future tobacco settlement receipts ($1.7
billion); eliminating the need for seasonal borrowing by the New York Local
Government Assistance Corporation ($2.3 billion); and borrowing for local
highway and bridge projects ($4 billion), local mass transit projects ($1.6
billion), and a wide variety of grants and other expenditures not resulting in
New York State capital assets ($13.2 billion).  This deficit in unrestricted net
position of governmental activities can be expected to continue for as long as
the State of New York continues to have obligations outstanding for purposes
other than the acquisition of New York State governmental capital assets.


The net position for business-type activities increased by $1.6 billion
(191.7%) to $771 million for the 2014-15 fiscal year as compared to a deficit of
$841 million in the 2013-14 fiscal year.  The increase in net position for
business-type activities was caused primarily by employer contributions and
other revenue exceeding unemployment benefit payments for the state's
"Unemployment Insurance Fund" ($1.8 billion), lottery revenues exceeding
expenses, including education aid transfers ($83 million) and City University of
New York Senior College operating


-50-





revenues and state support exceeding operating expenses ($11 million).  This was
partially offset by State University of New York ("SUNY") expenses exceeding
operating revenues and state support ($232 million).


New York General Fund Budgetary Highlights.  New York General Fund receipts
exceeded disbursements by $5.1 billion in the 2014-15 fiscal year.  The New York
General Fund ended the 2014-15 fiscal year with a closing cash fund balance of
$7.3 billion, which consisted of $1.8 billion in the state's rainy day reserve
funds ($1.3 billion in the state's "Tax Stabilization Reserve Account" and $540
million in its "Rainy Day Reserve Account"), $74 million in its "Community
Projects Fund," $21 million in its "Contingency Reserve Fund," and $5.4 billion
in its "Refund Reserve Account."  Total New York General Fund receipts for the
year (including transfers from other funds) were approximately $67.9 billion.
Total New York General Fund disbursements for the year (including transfers to
other funds) were approximately $62.9 billion.


Net operating results for the 2014-15 fiscal year were $5.2 billion more
favorable than anticipated in the state's original financial plan, with net
operating results in the original plan projected at $180 million.  Both total
receipts and total disbursements exceeded original financial plan estimates with
total receipts exceeding original financial plan estimates by $5 billion and
total disbursements less than original financial plan estimates by $286 million.


Several factors contributed to higher than projected total receipts.
Actual base tax growth for the 2014-15 fiscal year finished at 4.0%, which was
higher than the original financial plan estimate of 3.2%.  Higher overall tax
collections were primarily attributable to higher business tax collections
across all components, which were particularly driven by a stronger underlying
liability for the corporate franchise tax, higher audits for the bank tax, and
fewer than anticipated corporate franchise tax refunds paid.  Lower than
projected total disbursements occurred in multiple spending categories including
local assistance, state operations, and general state charges.  Lower spending
in these categories was partially offset by higher than projected transfers,
including transfers to support capital financing needs, and transfers related to
the early payment of certain fiscal year 2015-16 debt service obligations.


Net operating results for 2014-15 fiscal year were $469 million less
favorable than anticipated in the final financial plan, with net operating
results in the final financial plan projected at $5.5 billion.  Total receipts
and disbursements were lower than the final financial plan estimates (by $794
million and $325 million, respectively).  Lower than projected total receipts
were primarily due to the delay of certain monetary settlement payments to the
state which were expected to be received prior to March 31, 2015, partly offset
by other monetary settlements received by the state which were unanticipated in
the final financial plan.  Lower than projected total disbursements mainly
reflected lower assistance and state operations, partly off-set by higher
transfer to support capital financing needs


Capital Assets.  As of the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year, the State of New
York has $101.8 billion invested in a broad range of capital assets, including
equipment, buildings, construction in progress, land preparation, and
infrastructure, which primarily includes roads and bridges.  This amount
represented a net increase (including additions and deductions) of $1.4 billion
over the previous year,.


-51-





Debt Administration.  There are a number of methods by which the New York
may incur debt.  The state has obtained long-term financing in the form of
voter-approved general obligation debt (voter-approved debt) and other
obligations that are authorized by legislation but not approved by the voters
(non-voter-approved debt), including lease purchase and contractual obligations
where New York's legal obligation to make payments is subject to and paid from
annual appropriations made by the New York State legislature or from assignment
of revenue in the case of tobacco settlement revenue bonds, equipment and
building capital leases, and mortgage loan commitments, which represent $302
million as of the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year, do not require legislative or
voter approval.  Other obligations include certain bonds issued through New York
public authorities, certificates of participation, and capital leases obtained
through vendors.  New York administers its long-term financing needs as a single
portfolio of New York-supported debt that includes general obligation bonds and
other obligations of both its governmental activities and business-type
activities.  Most of the debt reported under business-type activities, all of
which was issued for capital assets used in those activities, is supported by
payments from resources generated by New York's governmental activities-thus it
is not expected to be repaid from resources generated by business-type
activities.


At the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year, the state had $193 million in state-
supported (net) variable rate bonds outstanding and $1.9 billion in interest
rate exchange agreements, in which the state issues variable rate bonds and
enters into a swap agreement that effectively converts the rate to a fixed rate.
At the end of the fiscal year 2014-15, variable rate bonds, net of those subject
to the fixed rate swaps, were equal to 0.4% of the state-supported debt
portfolio. Variable rate bonds that were converted to a synthetic fixed rate
through swap agreements of $1.9 billion were equal to 4% of the total state-
supported debt portfolio.  At the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year, the state had
$57.4 billion in bonds, notes, and other financing agreements outstanding
compared with $8.3 billion in 2014, an increase of $932 million, with prior year
amounts for business-type activities being restated to reflect the
implementation of accounting standards.  In addition, the state reported $870
million for collateralized borrowings ($430 million in governmental activities
and $440 million in business-type activities) for which specific revenues have
been pledged.  During the 2014-15 fiscal year, the state issued $5 billion in
bonds, of which $1.8 billion was for refunding and $3.2 billion was for new
borrowing.


The New York State Constitution, with exceptions for emergencies, limits
the amount of general obligation bonds that can be issued to that amount
approved by the voters for a single work or purpose in a general election.  As
of the end of the 2014-15 fiscal year, New York had $2.7 million in authorized
but unissued bond capacity that can be used to issue bonds for specifically
approved purposes.  New York may issue short-term debt without voter approval in
anticipation of the receipt of taxes and revenues or proceeds from duly
authorized but not issued general obligation bonds.  The state finance law,
through the New York State Debt Reform Act of 2000 (the "New York Debt Reform
Act"), also imposes phased-in caps on the issuance of new New York-supported
debt and related debt service costs.  The New York Debt Reform Act also limits
the use of debt to capital works and purposes, and establishes a maximum length
of term for repayment of 30 years.  The New York Debt Reform Act applies to all
New York-supported debt.  The New York Debt Reform Act does not apply to debt
issued prior to April 1, 2000 or to other obligations issued by public
authorities where New York is not the direct obligor.


-52-





Litigation. The State of New York is a defendant in numerous legal
proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of routine
governmental operations.  Such litigation includes, but is not limited to,
claims asserted against the state arising from alleged torts, alleged breaches
of contracts, condemnation proceedings, and other alleged violations of state
and federal laws.


Included in the state's outstanding litigation were a number of cases
challenging the legality or the adequacy of a variety of significant social
welfare programs, primarily involving the state's Medicaid and mental health
programs.  Adverse judgments in these matters generally could result in
injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in patient care that could
require substantial increased financing of the litigated programs in the future.
With respect to pending and threatened litigation in the 2014-15 fiscal year,
the state has reported, in the governmental activities, liabilities of $707
million, of which $536 million pertains to SUNY, for awarded and anticipated
unfavorable judgments.  In addition, the state has been party to other claims
and litigation that its legal counsel has advised may result in possible adverse
court decisions with estimated potential losses of approximately $318 million.


Ratings.  As of May 6, 2016 all outstanding general obligation bonds of the
State of New York were rated "AA+" by S&P Global Ratings a division of S&P
Global, Inc., and "Aa1" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.  Any explanation
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating
agencies.  There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period
of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by local New York issuers may be unrelated to the
creditworthiness of obligations issued by the State of New York, and there is no
obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations in
the event of default.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport
to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which
the issuers of such obligations are subject.  Additionally, many factors
including national economic, social and environmental policies and conditions,
which are not within the control of the issuers of such bonds, could affect or
could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the state and various
agencies and political subdivisions thereof.  The sponsor is unable to predict
whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers
of the bonds, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of
the respective issuers of such bonds to pay interest on or principal of such
bonds.


ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  Each trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent)
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations
in the prices of the securities


-53-





between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because
the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs.



ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST



DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS BY REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAKING
SEMIANNUAL/QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS OR GRANTOR TRUSTS.  The discussion in this
section applies to all trusts other than trusts that are "regulated investment
companies" for tax purposes that have monthly distribution dates.  Income
received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the Income Account for the
trust.  All other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate Capital
Account for the trust.  The trustee will normally distribute any income received
by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of
record on the preceding record date. A trust will also generally make required
distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each
year if it has elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" for
federal tax purposes.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to
their pro rata share of the available balance of the Income Account of the
related trust.  All distributions will be net of applicable expenses.  There is
no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends
received may be used to pay expenses.  In addition, excess amounts from the
Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed on each distribution
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record
date, provided that the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the
Capital Account unless the amount available for distribution is at least $1.00
per 100 units.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities
after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in
the Capital Account and not distributed until the next distribution date
applicable to the Capital Account.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a trust is
designed to be a grantor trust for tax purposes, the trustee is not required to
make a distribution from the Income Account or the Capital Account unless the
total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of the trust's net asset
value as determined under the trust agreement, provided that the trustee is
required to distribute the balance of the Income Account and Capital Account on
the distribution date occurring in December of each year.  The trustee is not
required to pay interest on funds held in the Capital or Income Accounts (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such
funds).


The distribution to the unitholders of a trust as of each record date will
be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall
consist of an amount substantially equal to the unitholders' pro rata share of
the available balance of the Income Account of the trust after deducting
estimated expenses.  Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant
rate throughout the year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to
fluctuate.


DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS BY REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAKING
MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  The discussion in this section applies if your trust is
a "regulated investment company" that has monthly distribution dates.  Income
received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the Income Account for the
trust.  All other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate Capital
Account for the trust.  The trustee will normally distribute income received by
a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record
on the preceding record date. The trust generally pays distributions from its
Income Account (pro-rated on an


-54-





annual basis) along with any excess balance from the Capital Account on each
monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date
as described in greater detail below.  All distributions will be net of
applicable expenses.  The amount of your distributions will vary from time to
time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change.  The trust
will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid
imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has elected to be taxed as a
"regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes.  Excess amounts from
the Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to
the unitholders then of record.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any
of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution
date will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next
distribution date applicable to the Capital Account.  The trustee shall not be
required to make a distribution from the Capital Account unless the cash balance
on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute
at least $1.00 per 100 units.  The trustee is not required to pay interest on
funds held in the Capital or Income Accounts (but may itself earn interest
thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds).


The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter.  When the trust receives
dividends from a portfolio security, the trustee credits the dividends to the
trust's accounts.  In an effort to make relatively regular income distributions,
the trust's distribution from the Income Account on each distribution date to
each unitholder is equal to such unitholder's pro rata share of the cash balance
in the Income Account calculated on the basis of a fraction (the numerator of
which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of distribution
dates per year) of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing
twelve months computed as of the close of business on the record date
immediately preceding such distribution after deduction of (1) the fees and
expenses then deductible pursuant to the trust agreement and (2) the trustee's
estimate of other expenses properly chargeable to the Income Account pursuant to
the trust agreement which have accrued as of such record date or are otherwise
properly attributable to the period to which such distribution relates.  Because
the trust does not receive dividends from the portfolio securities at a constant
rate throughout the year, the trust's income distributions to unitholders may be
more or less than the amount credited to the trust accounts as of the record
date.  In the event that the amount on deposit in the Income Account is not
sufficient for the payment of the amount intended to be distributed to
unitholders on the basis of the computation described above, the trustee is
authorized to advance its own funds and cause to be deposited in and credited to
the Income Account such amounts as may be required to permit payment of the
related distribution to be made as described above.  In such an event, the
trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed, without interest, out of income
payments received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance.  Any such
advance shall be reflected in the Income Account until repaid.


GENERAL.  Persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions
only after such person becomes a record owner.  A person will become the owner
of units, and thereby a unitholder of record, on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received.  Notification to the trustee of the transfer of units
is the responsibility of the purchaser, but in the normal course of business the
selling broker-dealer provides such notice.


-55-





The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account of
the trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust.  The trustee also
may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust.
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the related trust's
assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such
amounts to the appropriate accounts.  In addition, the trustee may withdraw from
the Income and Capital Accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to
cover redemptions of units.


STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.


The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit is not required.  The
accountants' report for any audit will be furnished by the trustee to any
unitholder upon written request.  Within a reasonable period of time after the
end of each calendar year, the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any
time during the calendar year was a unitholder of a trust a statement, covering
the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:


(A)  As to the Income Account:


(1)  the amount of income received on the securities (including income
received as a portion of the proceeds of any disposition of
securities);


(2)  the amounts paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the applicable
trust agreement, if any, and for redemptions;


(3)  the deductions, if any, from the Income Account for payment into
the Reserve Account;


(4)  the deductions for applicable taxes and fees and expenses of the
trustee, the sponsor, the evaluator, the supervisor, counsel,
auditors and any other expenses paid by the trust;


(5)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for
purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or
for purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the applicable
trust agreement, if any;

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of the trust, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and
liabilities of the parties to the applicable trust agreement.  By purchasing
units of a trust, each unitholder expressly waives any right he may have under
any rule of law, or the provisions of any statute, or otherwise, to require the
trustee at any time to account, in any manner other than as expressly provided
in the applicable trust agreement, in respect of the portfolio securities or
moneys from time to time received, held and applied by the trustee under the
trust agreement.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the operation
and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect to the
amendment of the related trust agreement or termination of the trust.


AMENDMENT.  Each trust agreement may be amended from time to time by the
sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the consent of any
of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any
provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision
contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to change provision required by the
Security Exchange Commission or any successor governmental agency and (iii) to
make such other provision in regard to matters or questions arising under the
trust agreement as shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the
unitholders or (iv) to make such amendments as may be necessary (a) for a trust
to continue to qualify as a "regulated investment company" (a "RIC") for federal
income tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as such under the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or (b) to prevent a trust from
being deemed an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes if the trust has not elected to be taxed as a RIC under the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  A trust agreement may not be amended,
however, without the consent of all unitholders of the related trust then
outstanding, so as (1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof, the acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those
specified in the schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the
percentage of units the holders of which are required to consent to certain of
such amendments.  A trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the
interest in the trust represented by units without the consent of all affected
unitholders.


Except for the amendments, changes or modifications described above,
neither the sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment, change
or modification of a trust agreement without the giving of notice and the
obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No


-58-





amendment may reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are
required to consent to any amendment, change or modification of a trust
agreement without the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then
outstanding of the affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made
which would (1) alter the rights to the unitholders of the trust as against each
other, (2) provide the trustee with the power to engage in business or
investment activities other than as specifically provided in the trust
agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax status of the related trust for federal
income tax purposes or result in the units being deemed to be sold or exchanged
for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless a trust has elected to be taxed as
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes, result in a
variation of the investment of unitholders in the trust.  The trustee will
notify unitholders of a trust of the substance of any such amendment to the
trust agreement for such trust.


TERMINATION. Each trust agreement provides that the related trust shall
terminate upon the maturity, liquidation, redemption, sale or other disposition
of the last of the securities held in the trust but in no event is it to
continue beyond the trust's mandatory termination date.  If the value of a trust
shall be less than 40% of the total value of securities deposited in the trust
during the initial offering period, the trustee may, in its discretion, and
shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.  A trust may be
terminated at any time by the holders of units representing 66 2/3% of the units
thereof then outstanding.  A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the
event that a sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered
for redemption by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be
reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time they were
deposited in the trust.  If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of
unsold units by the sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units
of the trust the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser.


Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the scheduled
termination date described in the prospectus for a trust, the trustee may begin
to sell all of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in
connection with the termination of the trust.  The sponsor may assist the
trustee in these sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by
applicable law.  The sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses
involved in the sales.


The sponsor will generally instruct the trustee to sell the securities as
quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its
judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but
it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of
within a reasonable time after a trust's termination.  The sponsor does not
anticipate that the period will be longer than one month, and it could be as
short as one day, depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold.  The
liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security
and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day.
Of course, no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities
will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings.


Not less than thirty days prior to termination of a trust, the trustee will
notify unitholders thereof of the termination and provide a form allowing
qualifying unitholders to elect an in kind distribution, if applicable.  If
applicable, a unitholder who owns the minimum number of units described in the
prospectus may request an in kind distribution from the trustee instead of cash.


-59-





The trustee will make an in kind distribution through the distribution of each
of the securities of a trust in book entry form to the account of the
unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company.  The unitholder
will be entitled to receive whole shares of each of the securities comprising
the portfolio of the related trust and cash from the Capital Account equal to
the fractional shares to which the unitholder is entitled.  The trustee may
adjust the number of shares of any security included in a unitholder's in kind
distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole shares.  The sponsor may
terminate the in kind distribution option at any time upon sixty days notice to
the unitholders.  Special federal income tax consequences will result if a
unitholder requests an in kind distribution.


Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust not segregated for in kind distribution.  After
paying all expenses and charges incurred by a trust, the trustee will distribute
to unitholders thereof their pro rata share of the balances remaining in the
Income and Capital Accounts of the trust.


The sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a
subsequent series of a trust at approximately the time of the mandatory
termination date.  If the sponsor does offer such units for sale, unitholders
may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price
that includes a reduced sales charge.  There is, however, no assurance that
units of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at that time, or if
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the
requests of any or all unitholders.


THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject
to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of
New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


Under each trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trust created by the trust agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.  If the trustee
merges or is consolidated with another entity, the resulting entity shall be the
successor trustee without the execution or filing of any paper instrument or
further act.


The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law


-60-





now or hereafter in effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian,
trustee, sequestrator (or similar official) for the trustee or for any
substantial part of its property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall
generally fail to pay its debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such
written standards for the trustee's performance as shall be established from
time to time by the sponsor, or if the sponsor determines in good faith that
there has occurred either (1) a material deterioration in the creditworthiness
of the trustee or (2) one or more grossly negligent acts on the part of the
trustee with respect to a trust, the sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written
notice, may remove the trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written
instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and
appointment shall be mailed to each unitholder by the successor trustee.  Upon
execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee,
all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall
vest in the successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the
laws of the United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws
to exercise trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and
undivided profits of not less than $5,000,000.


THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of each trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
The sponsor is a broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-
dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other financial
professionals. The sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,
Monument, Colorado 80132. You can contact the Advisors Asset Management unit
investment trust division at 8100 East 22nd Street North, Building 800, Suite
102, Wichita, Kansas 67226 or by using the contacts listed on the back cover of
the prospectus. The sponsor is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser
and a member of the Financial Industry Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and a registrant of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).


Under each trust agreement, the sponsor may resign and be discharged of the
trust created by the trust agreement by executing an instrument in writing and
filing the same with the trustee.  If the sponsor merges or is consolidated with
another entity, the resulting entity shall be the successor sponsor without the
execution or filing of any paper instrument or further act.


If at any time the sponsor shall resign or fail to undertake or perform any
of the duties which by the terms of a trust agreement are required by it to be
undertaken or performed, or the sponsor shall become incapable of acting or
shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the sponsor or of
its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or
control of the sponsor or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the trustee may (a) appoint a
successor sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding such reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and
liquidate the related trust as provided therein, or (c) continue to act as
trustee without appointing a successor sponsor and receive additional
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.


-61-





THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor
or trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be
delivered by the trustee to each unitholder.


LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to any
trust or unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good
faith pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, or for
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the purchase or sale of securities,
provided, however, that such parties will not be protected against any liability
to which they would otherwise be subjected by reason of their own willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or
its reckless disregard for their duties under the trust agreement. Each trust
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the sponsor, supervisor and
evaluator from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred in acting in
such capacity (including the cost and expenses of the defense against such loss,
liability or expense) other than by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under the applicable trust agreement.
Such parties are not under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any
legal action which in their opinion may involve them in any expense or
liability.  The trustee will be indemnified by each trust and held harmless
against any loss or liability accruing to it without gross negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the trust, including the costs and expenses
(including counsel fees) of defending itself against any claim of liability in
the premises.


The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,
nor shall the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or
loss incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the
event that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be
liable for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
trustee.


EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor may receive a fee from your trust for
creating and developing the trust, including determining the trust's objectives,
policies, composition and size, selecting service providers and information
services and for providing other similar administrative and ministerial
functions. The amount of this "creation and development fee" is set forth in the
prospectus. The trustee will deduct this amount from your trust's assets as of
the close of the initial offering period. No portion of this fee is applied to
the payment of distribution


-62-





expenses or as compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be deducted
from proceeds received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before
the close of the initial public offering period.


For services performed under a trust's trust agreement the trustee shall be
paid a fee at an annual rate in the amount per unit set forth in such trust
agreement. The trustee shall charge a pro rated portion of its annual fee at the
times specified in such trust agreement, which pro rated portion shall be
calculated on the basis of the largest number of units in such trust at any time
during the primary offering period. After the primary offering period has
terminated, the fee shall accrue daily and be based on the number of units
outstanding on the first business day of each calendar year in which the fee is
calculated or the number of units outstanding at the end of the primary offering
period, as appropriate.  The annual trustee fee shall be prorated for any
calendar year in which the trustee provides services during less than the whole
of such year. The trustee may from time to time adjust its compensation as set
forth above provided that total adjustment upward does not, at the time of such
adjustment, exceed the percentage of the total increase in consumer prices for
services as measured by the United States Department of Labor Consumer Price
Index entitled "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" or similar index, if such
index should no longer be published.  The consent or concurrence of any
unitholder shall not be required for any such adjustment or increase. Such
compensation shall be calculated and paid in installments by the trustee against
the Income and Capital Accounts of each trust; provided, however, that such
compensation shall be deemed to provide only for the usual, normal and proper
functions undertaken as trustee pursuant to the trust agreement.  The trustee
shall also charge the Income and Capital Accounts of each trust for any and all
expenses and disbursements incurred as provided in the trust agreement.


As compensation for portfolio supervisory services in its capacity as
supervisor, evaluation services in its capacity as evaluator and for providing
bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character described in

Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the
sponsor shall be paid an annual fee in the amount per unit set forth in the
trust agreement for a trust. The sponsor shall receive a pro rated portion of
its annual fee from the trustee upon receipt of an invoice by the trustee from
the sponsor, upon which, as to the cost incurred by the sponsor of providing
such services the trustee may rely. Such fee shall be calculated on the basis of
the largest number of units in such trust at any time during the primary
offering period. After the primary offering period has terminated, the fee shall
accrue daily and be based on the number of units outstanding on the first
business day of each calendar year in which the fee is calculated or the number
of units outstanding at the end of the primary offering period, as appropriate.
Such annual fee shall be pro rated for any calendar year in which the sponsor
provides services during less than the whole of such year, but in no event shall
such compensation when combined with all compensation received from a trust for
providing such services in any calendar year exceed the aggregate cost to the
sponsor for providing such services, in the aggregate.  Such compensation may,
from time to time, be adjusted provided that the total adjustment upward does
not, at the time of such adjustment, exceed the percentage of the total increase
in consumer prices for services as measured by the United States Department of
Labor Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" or
similar index, if such index should no longer be published.  The consent or


-63-





concurrence of any unitholder shall not be required for any such adjustment or
increase.  Such compensation shall be charged against the Income and/or Capital
Accounts of a trust.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by a trust in
addition to any other fees, expenses or charges described in the prospectus:

(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;

(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the
trustee for any loss or liability accruing to it without gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct on its part arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the trust; (f) indemnification of the sponsor
for any loss, liability or expense incurred in acting in that capacity other
than by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties or its reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under the trust agreement; (g) indemnification of the supervisor for any
loss, liability or expense incurred in acting as supervisor of the trust other
than by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under the trust agreement; (h) indemnification of the
evaluator for any loss, liability or expense incurred in acting as evaluator of
the trust other than by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under the trust agreement; (i)
expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon termination of the trust;
and (j) license fees for the right to use trademarks and trade names,
intellectual property rights or for the use of databases and research owned by
third party licensors.  The sponsor is authorized to obtain from Mutual Fund
Quotation Service (or similar service operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
or its successor) a unit investment trust ticker symbol for each trust and to
contract for the dissemination of the unit prices through that service.  A trust
will bear any cost or expense incurred in connection with the obtaining of the
ticker symbol and the dissemination of unit prices.  A trust may pay the costs
of updating its registration statement each year.  All fees and expenses are
payable out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on
the trust.  If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient
to provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or
losses to unitholders.


Each trust will pay the costs of organizing the trust.  These costs may
include, but are not limited to, the cost of the initial preparation and
typesetting of the registration statement, prospectuses (including preliminary
prospectuses), the trust agreement and other documents relating to the
applicable trust, Securities and Exchange Commission and state blue sky
registration fees, the costs of the initial valuation of the portfolio and audit
of a trust, the costs of a portfolio consultant, if any, one-time license fees,
if any, the initial fees and expenses of the trustee, and legal and other
out-of-pocket expenses related thereto but not including the expenses incurred
in the printing of prospectuses (including preliminary prospectuses), expenses
incurred in the preparation and printing of brochures and other advertising
materials and any other selling expenses.  A trust will sell securities to
reimburse the sponsor for these costs at the end of the


-64-





initial offering period or after six months, if earlier.  The value of the units
will decline when a trust pays these costs.


PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION.  When a trust sells
securities, the composition and diversity of the securities in the trust may be
altered.  In order to obtain the best price for a trust, it may be necessary for
the sponsor to specify minimum amounts in which blocks of securities are to be
sold.  In effecting purchases and sales of a trust's portfolio securities, the
sponsor may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid
to brokers, including the sponsor or brokers which may be affiliated with the
trust, the sponsor, the trustee or dealers participating in the offering of
units.

                              (File No. 333-210128)








Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have served as counsel for the Fund, in connection with the preparation,
execution and delivery of a trust agreement dated as of the date shown above
(the "Indenture") among Advisors Asset Management, Inc., as depositor,
supervisor and evaluator (the "Depositor") and The Bank of New York Mellon, as
trustee (the "Trustee"), pursuant to which the Depositor has delivered to and
deposited the securities listed in the schedule to the Indenture with the
Trustee and pursuant to which the Trustee has provided to or on the order of the
Depositor documentation evidencing ownership of units (the "Units") of
fractional undivided interest in and ownership of the unit investment trust of
the Fund (the "Trust"), created under said Indenture.


In connection therewith we have examined such pertinent records and
documents and matters of law as we have deemed necessary in order to enable us
to express the opinions hereinafter set forth.  We have assumed the genuineness
of all agreements, instruments and documents submitted to us as originals and
the conformity to originals of all copies thereof submitted to us. We have also
assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all persons
executing agreements, instruments and documents examined or relied upon by us.


We have not reviewed the financial statements, compilation of the
securities to be acquired by the Trust, or other financial or statistical data
contained in the registration statement and the prospectus, as to which we
understand you have been furnished with the reports of the accountants appearing
in the registration statement and the prospectus. In addition, we have made no
specific inquiry as to whether any stop order or investigatory proceedings have
been commenced with respect to the registration statement or the Depositor nor
have we reviewed court or governmental agency dockets.


Statements in this opinion as to the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of agreements, instruments and documents are subject: (i) to
limitations as to enforceability imposed by bankruptcy, reorganization,
moratorium, insolvency and other laws of general application relating to or
affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights, and (ii) to limitations under
equitable principles governing the availability of equitable remedies.


The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New
York. No opinion is expressed as to the effect that the law of any other
jurisdiction might have upon the subject matter of the opinions expressed herein
under applicable conflicts of law principles, rules or regulations or otherwise.





Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1.   The execution and delivery of the Indenture and the
execution and issuance of the Units in the Trust have been duly
authorized; and


2.   The Units in the Trust, when duly executed and delivered by
the Depositor and the Trustee in accordance with the aforementioned
Indenture, will constitute valid and binding obligations of such Trust
and the Depositor and such Units, when issued and delivered in
accordance with the Indenture against payment of the consideration set
forth in the Fund prospectus, will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
registration statement relating to the Units referred to above and to the use of
our name and to the reference to our firm in said registration statement and in
the related prospectus.  This opinion is intended solely for the benefit of the
addressee in connection with the issuance of Units of the Trust and may not be
relied upon in any other manner or by any other person without our express
written consent.


Very truly yours,

called the "Portfolio Assets").


We have examined the Trust Agreement, and originals (or copies certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments,
certificates and documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the

and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Depositor, the
Trust Agreement and the Standard Terms are valid and legally binding obligations
of The Bank of New York Mellon.


3.   The Receipts for Units are in proper form for execution by you, as Trustee,
and have been duly executed by you, as Trustee, and pursuant to the Depositor's

the ownership of the Units by Cede & Co., as nominee of the Depository Trust
Company where it has caused the Units to be credited to the account of the

In rendering the foregoing opinion we have not considered, among other things,
the merchantability of the Portfolio Assets, whether the Portfolio Assets have
been duly authorized and delivered or the tax status of the Portfolio Assets
under any federal, state or local laws.


The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York and the
federal laws of the United States of America.  This opinion is for your benefit
and may not be disclosed to or relied upon by any other person without our prior
written consent.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement relating to the Units and to the use of our name and the
reference to our firm in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus.

Factoid of the Day


Tuesday, July 25, 2017






The Weather Company announced yesterday that it expects a total of 15 named storms and eight hurricanes (three will be major in scope) in the Atlantic this hurricane season. The 2017 season began on June 1. Its forecast matches the average amount of activity posted from 1995 through 2016 (15 named storms and eight hurricanes/three major in scope). Since 1980, there have been 32 hurricanes in the U.S. that produced damages in excess of $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and Bloomberg. The combined losses, adjusted for inflation, totaled $549.9 billion, with Katrina (2005) accounting for $156.3 billion of it.
