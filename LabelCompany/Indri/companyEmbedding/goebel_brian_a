Molly Goebel and Brian Whitemore's Wedding Website







MenuMolly and Brian   October 21, 2017    • Chaska, MN91 days to go!Our StoryThe MeetingIn 2009 Brian graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. When Brian returned to Minneapolis he went to work for his families business Whitemore Fire Consultants. As time passed it became clear that with the rapid hair growth and overgrown locks of his wavy blonde hair, a haircut was needed. As luck would have it, Brian stopped into Coles Salon in Savage, MN for a "walk-in" appointment one day. A beautiful young woman named Molly had just finished Beauty School at Aveda and was starting her career at that salon and had an opening for a "men's haircut." Immediately Brian felt a connection. It was later explained that it was her job to be nice, but with some persistence Molly agreed to a date. One evening after Molly had finished her work day, the two met at Bonfire in Savage, MN for a happy hour. After a few dates, and a trip to the movie theatre to see the worlds worst movie, it was decided that the timing wasn't quite right. Throughout the years they kept in touch.In 2015 Molly and Brian reconnected via sharing Snapchats of their 4 legged friends. After a walk at the dog park together, the fire rekindled. It started with a walk, then Brian cooking his famous Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp for Molly for dinner and grew from there. In the fall of 2016 Brian and Molly took Europe on during their great European Adventure. During this time they continued to learn about each other and grow in their relationship. Both would agree this is where they truly fell in love. (Perhaps it was the bottomless house wine and the beautiful waters of the Mediterranean Sea) but it the end they both returned from that trip and "knew."In November Brian reached out to his sister for some "advice" on picking out an engagement ring. After a few secret trips to "Golf Galaxy" to look at golf clubs for Alex (Stacy's Husband) the perfect ring was found. Prior to the big purchase Brian called Molly's father David for his permission for Molly's hand in marriage. Brian recalled Dave's comments as, "It never is easy to give your daughter away, but I think that this is a great idea."It was Brian's intent to wait until Spring of 2017 to ask Molly on the beach in Florida, but with Stacy knowing, and about all of the groomsmen, and bridemaides knowing, the time needed to come sooner rather than later. In late November, Brian put his love of Thanksgiving behind him and went Clark Griswold on their home in Bloomington. As they were decorating their first Christmas Tree together, Brian told Molly that he had one more ornament for the tree. When she turned around Brian presented her with the ring. It was the first time in Brian's life he couldn't get a word out. It was quite comical. After Molly responded multiple times with, "Are you serious?" Finally a Yes was slid in there. The rest is history.The WeddingSaturday, October 21, 20173:00 PMCeremonySt Philip the Deacon Lutheran Church17205 County Rd 6, Plymouth, MN 55447, USAReceptionHazeltine National Golf Club1900 Hazeltine Blvd, Chaska, MN 55318, USAWedding PartyAbigail Baer - Matron of HonorAbigail is my big sister. I've looked up to her for as long as I can remember. She's always looked out for me, and her advice is something I will always appreciate. Abby lived in Minneapolis before I moved here. Lucky for me, she gets to come visit quite often for weddings and other celebrations. We have made many memories over those quick weekends. I only had her "almost" miss her flight just once! Breakfast is important (even during a blizzard). Her adventurous self led her to California where she resides with her husband. They are avid Packer fans living in San Diego. I mean, that makes them pretty cool! Hannah Beshara - Matron of HonorHannah is my other big (middle) sister. I've always looked up to Hannah, so much that I was her for a few years before I turned 21 :). When I was in Cosmetology school Hannah moved to the cities for a short period of time. We had some of the most memorable times together. She was my very first live client who's hair I colored in school. Lucky for her I not only colored her hair, but everything she was wearing too, including her purse. She forgave me and we celebrated with getting our first tattoos together! Hannah and her husband Max have my nephew, Hank and another one on the way! They live an adventurous life in Rapid City, SD.Stacy Jadin - BridesmaidStacy is Brian's one and only sister. As luck would have it we get along great and I feel extremely lucky to have her as a friend. As most big sisters, she gives great advice, and already has my back. We already have great memories together. Stacy, her husband and two little boys reside in Savage. Stopping at their house on my way home from work for a glass of wine isn't always a bad idea :). I am truly thrilled to be gaining another sister! Hannah Johnson - BridesmaidI met Hannah my first day of working at Cole's Salon. Hannah started working at Cole's a little bit before me but we hit it off right away! We worked together, went out after work, and did it all over again and surprisingly, never got sick of each other! Hannah has been by my side through many life events and I am so thrilled she will be by my side for this one! Although our lives are a little different now than they were when we were 19, we wouldn't change it for the world! Hannah lives in Savage along with her (soon to be) husband and big fur child, Thumper.Micah Schmitz - BridesmaidMicah and I have known each other for over ten years. We both grew up in Bismarck and were inseparable from junior high on. In high school we had the privilege of dancing and cheering together. Our stories from high school are best to not be on the internet, but we have matured just a bit since then ;). Micah moved from Bismarck to Minneapolis 2 1/2 years ago. I feel so lucky to have her so close. She has been there for me through many stages of my life and would drop so many things if you needed her to, she has the biggest heart. I've always looked up to her but it continues now that she is a wife and mother. Micah, her husband, and little girl live in Maple Grove.Kate Bickett - BridesmaidKate and I have known each other for 19 years. Not only is she a friend, but my little cousin, the little sister I never had. Growing up Kate lived in Minnesota and I lived in Bismarck, we didn't see each a lot but when we did it was special. Although Kate was the reason I found out Santa Clause wasn't real, I've forgiven her and have moved on from the trauma. And Kate has also forgiven me since I let go of her hand at Disney World and she got lost. This girl is young but so bright and has taught me so much about life. She loves to do mission work and help people in any way possible. Kate just finished her first year at UW-Lacrosse and I couldn't be more proud of her. I'm so happy to have her by my side! Hank Beshara - Ring BearerHank is my nephew and God chid. This child has taught me so much in his 2 years of life. He is an active little boy who loves trucks, dinos, animals and his kitty! He's also pretty excited to to become a big brother! Baby Beshara - Honorary Ring Bearer/Flower GirlBaby Beshara will be here mid September and we couldn't be more excited to find out if the baby will be in a dress or a mini tux for the big day! If the baby is anything like big brother Hank, we are winning! Michael Heckman - Best ManBrian met Mike "Hackers" Heckman at Stonebrook Golf Course during their Sophomore Year of High School during a JV Golf Match. The conclusion of that match is to not be discussed, Mike & Brian later re-connected at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where they were "Team Switzerland" during the beer Olympics, roommates and game day buddies. After they graduated Mike had a short stint in Minneapolis before his move to Hilton Head Island, SC. Over the year's Brian took every opportunity he could get to visit Mike and his wife Jackie in the south. In 2016 Mike and his wife moved back "home" and currently reside 1 mile from Molly & Brian in Bloomington, MN. Over the years too many stories come to mind to even begin to share. Stories from the Nebraska vs. Miami weekend in South Beach, the Great Cheese Curd fight of 2012, to the forbidden story of the JV Golf Match. No matter the story, no matter the situation, Mike has been there with and for Brian. It's no surprise Mike was asked to be one of Brian's Best Men. Vincent Aydin - Best ManBrother Vincent's story is a unique one to say the least. In 2004 Vincent was an exchange student at Prior Lake High School. Brian and Vincent first met on first day of the second week of 2-a-days when the coaches asked that Brian look after our "German Friend." Brian took that as "Be nice, and don't light the kid up." After Brian had an adult learning opportunity from his coach, he proceeded to hit Vincent as hard as he possibly could during a team scrimmage. This was the moment Brian truly understood the beauty of the German language. In the spirit of happiness, we will leave the translation of those words for everyones imagination. Throughout the season Vincent continued to get better and better as his understanding of American Football increased. In the Spring of 2005 they both graduated and went on their separate ways. As luck would have it, In 2007 a little thing called "Facebook" was created. Somewhere along the way a friend request was sent. Once "Facebook" friends, conversations between Vincent and Brian about the glory days became frequent along with conversations of Brian's lifelong dream of visiting Germany. In the summer before Brian's first senior year of college (There was a victory lap in there) Vincent invited Brian to join him on his summer European adventure. With some persuasion of parents, Brian boarded a plane to head across the pond. Since that moment, Brian has been to Europe 4 times visiting brother Vincent and his family for the great Oktoberfest celebration as well as various other countries. On the odd years, Vincent has joined the Whitemore Family for Hawaiian Vacations, Thanksgiving dinners, as well as various summer trips to the lakes of Minnesota. Their relationship is truly a testament as to how small and great our world truly is. Alex Jadin - GroomsmanAlex and Brian met in 2004 when Brian's sister and Alex began dating, that dating eventually turned into their marriage on June 6, 2008. Over the years Alex and Brian have been fast friends. They have been side by side for many vacations, holidays as well as been each others sanity for the famous "Family Trips" (For those curious why I say "famous" just ask us about the New Port Richie Adventure.) Minus Alex's love of the Badgers, Brian considers himself truly blessed to have a brother-in-law that he can call a friend.Ryan Dungan - GroomsmanRyan "Dungie" Dungan and Brian have been friends since Elementary school. They grew up together playing basketball, football, and running track. Since high school they have continued to be close as they compete in Fantasy Football, various golf outings as well as fishing adventures. Brian was fortunate enough to be a groomsman in Ryan's wedding. Over there years Ryan's competitive edge always came through. I think he as a $5 bet on about everything including the infamous "Pool Championships" in High School where some of the more comical conversations and inside jokes discussed today originated. Kile Lundy - GroomsmanKile is Brian's closest male Cousin. Kile and Brian have always had a lot in common including their love of sports and travel. Over the years Brian and Kile have adventured the mean streets of London where they tested all of the local Beers at their favorite London hot spots of Waxy's, Waxy's little sister and O'Neil's. There is also that unique story of the famous Fishing Trip to Canada while Kile was on leave from his time overseas. Needless to say, there has never been a dull moment. Tim Barrett - GroomsmanCaptain Tim Barrett is Brian's Captain at Station 2 at the Bloomington Fire Department. Tim took Brian under his wing after he began his employment at the BFD. During this time Tim's family and Brian have become very close which includes weekly "Family Dinners" as well as the occasional Blue Yummy on warm summer nights. Tim also is a Police Officer in the city of Bloomington where he lets Brian tag along for the occasional "ride along" where some real interesting stories come out. Tyler Orth - UsherTyler "Orth T Ripon" Orth and Brian have been friends since Elementary School. Tyler and Brian where hunting and fishing buddies since they can remember. Throughout the years they have been to Canada, Lake of the Woods and various other places across the states hunting and fishing. Tyler and Brian also played football together in High School which resulted in their famous "Last Play" as seniors where the coaches for whatever crazy reason let Brian play defense for 1 play. Per usual Tyler made the tackle, and Brian happened to trip and fall on Tyler which resulted in a 1/2 tackle for each guy. Tyler has always been a close friend, and someone Brian can count on. Nathan Beane - UsherNathan "Bean-Dip" Beane and Brian were hired in the same "Recruitment Class" at the Bloomington Fire Department. Over the last 5 years they have survived the fire academy as well as many "Smoke Fests" where they have the big BBQ showdown. Brian continues to give Nathan grief over his musical selection as well as his rockstar status at Station 4.Chris Sasse - UsherChris "Sassy Pants" Sasse and Brian were hired in the same "Recruitment Class" at the Bloomington Fire Department. Over the last 5 years they have survived the fire academy as well as many "Smoke Fests" where they have the big BBQ showdown. Chris is the Station 6 "gold standard" during the 5 calls per month (BEST JOKE EVER)Henry "Hank" Jadin - Ring BearerHenry is Brian's oldest nephew. He continues to be his source of entertainment where he teaches Brian and Molly about this really cool program on the computer called "google" where you can type in any question and get the answer. He is also his "Uncle Buddy's" biggest fan due to his joy and love of the fire trucks. Jacob Jadin - Ring BearerJake is Brian's youngest nephew. He is a bundle of energy and chaos which is likely a miniature version of Brian at that age. He loves to visit Uncle Buddy at the fire station and play the Ghost Busters game at Dave and Busters.

Repairing the American Dream for Younger Americans Before it is Too Late

 













 






 











Bio
 







Editor-in-Chief: Brian C. Goebel
Brian C. Goebel is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of 2040matters.com. He is an occasionally proud, but more often frustrated, member of Generation X. Brian resides in California, where he is happily married and the father of two wonderful children, Isabelle and Erich, to whom this Blog is dedicated.
Brian is a self-described recovering lawyer, a recognized expert on homeland security issues, a successful entrepreneur, and the President of Sentinel Holdings, LLC. He is a frequent speaker and writer on homeland security, constitutional law, and public policy issues, and has published opinion pieces in various publications ranging from the National Interest to the Washington Post. He is a member of Gen Next and the Pacific Council on International Policy.
Though he still carries a Blackberry and relies on his kids for IT support, this hasn’t stopped him from embarking upon career 4.0 as a blogger. He is focused on identifying and solving the biggest challenges facing the United States over the next 25 years so that Generation X+ can break the cycle of generational decline and restore the American Dream.
Brian grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio and Vienna, Virginia, and received his undergraduate degree from William and Mary, which his mom helped pay for by taking out a second mortgage on the family home. He then went on to earn his J.D. from William and Mary, which he paid for using a scholarship and student loans. He considers his family’s experience paying for college and graduate school to be a powerful lesson in generational duty, the inverse relationship between debt and choice, and the connection between hard work and opportunity.
Following a Clerkship with a Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Brian had a successful legal career in Los Angeles and Washington, DC with Gibson Dunn. During his career, he was very fortunate to work on a wide variety of public policy issues: He argued for a constitutional right to death with dignity under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause; helped overturn an unjustified and excessive damages award against a large department store chain; successfully represented a California inmate who had been unlawfully beaten by a correctional officer; worked on a variety of cases involving flawed agency rulemaking; and proved that a search of his client’s offices by federal law enforcement authorities violated the Fourth Amendment.
Brian left legal practice for public service following September 11th. In the week following the attacks, he began serving as a Counselor and Senior Policy Advisor to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs, Robert C. Bonner. In this role, Brian helped design and implement key programs and regulations to facilitate secure travel and trade, many of which remain cornerstones of the government’s border security efforts. He also helped oversee the 2003 transition from the Treasury Department into the Department of Homeland Security and the merger that created U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
In 2005, Brian left his traditional DC career track behind and founded his first consulting firm in order to continue to working on important public policy issues, including: border security and management (e.g., counter-proliferation, cross-border smuggling, and terrorist travel); customs modernization; immigration management; and transportation security. Under his leadership, and with the help of many talented colleagues, this firm grew into three separate businesses, including a data analytics firm (where Brian’s dependence on his Blackberry was a great source of amusement for his millennial data scientists). Together, these firms provided advice and expertise to public and private sector clients in the U.S. and abroad, including the UK, Estonia, Spain, Germany, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, and Ecuador as well as the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Customs Organization, and the United Nations. As a small business owner, Brian is familiar with the myriad tax, licensing, insurance, payroll processing, fundraising, health insurance, retirement benefit, and labor law obstacles that successful entrepreneurs must navigate.
In 2014, Brian and his partners achieved a goal shared by many entrepreneurs: They sold one of their businesses — the data analytics firm. That same year, Brian lost his mother after she lost her second battle with cancer.  Struggling to care for his mother, even with the amazing help of his sister and caring physicians, nurses, and hospice professionals, Brian learned several more lessons on generational duty and observed the strengths and weaknesses of our healthcare system for the elderly.  As a result of these events, Brian decided it was time to leave DC behind. He moved west, as Americans have done for more than 150 years, to seek a better life for his family and to escape the cynicism, gridlock, partisanship, and Type A+ personalities that can define life inside the Beltway. With just a few months of ocean air and exposure to the sunny optimism of Californians, Brian was downgraded to Type A- (a positive development, unlike the downgrading of the U.S. bond rating).
Today, Brian is the Chairman of two boutique consulting firms, and a firm believer in the American Dream as well as the axiom that “you make your own luck.” He has shifted his priorities to spending time with his family, coaching youth baseball, publishing 2040matters, and promoting Reason in Government (a civic engagement organization dedicated to government reform).

Bryan Goebel

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bryan Goebel (born October 15, 1961 in Kansas City, Kansas) is a right-handed professional bowler who currently resides in Shawnee, Kansas. He is a member of the Professional Bowlers Association. Having previously bowled on the PBA Tour, he now participates on the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour). He has topped $1 million in career PBA earnings.[1] Goebel's release style is that of a power stroker. He has the rev-rate and hook pattern of a cranker, but uses the smooth slide step of a stroker.
Goebel won his first PBA tournament at the 1990 Miller Lite Challenge. He won four titles in the 1994 PBA season and cashed a career-high $172,182, but was beaten out for PBA Player of the Year honors by Norm Duke, who won five titles that same year. Goebel won the Tucson Open in back-to-back seasons (1995 and 1996). He won his ninth title and lone PBA major at the 1998 PBA Tournament of Champions, held that season in his native Kansas.[1]
At the PBA Medford Open, held in January, 2003,[2] Goebel won his tenth PBA title, defeating Danny Wiseman 257–212.[3] This victory made him eligible for inclusion into the PBA Hall of Fame.[4]
Goebel served as a color analyst for ESPN on a few broadcasts in the 1990s. He filled in for Marshall Holman in 1996 when Holman won his final PBA title[citation needed].
After more than a decade of eligibility, Goebel was voted into the PBA Hall of Fame in December, 2016. He was officially inducted on February 13, 2017.[5] In his induction speech, Goebel spoke about the difficult decision to become a full-time touring pro:

"In 1988, I had been a pro bowler for eight years and didn't have a title. I quit my job and decided if I was ever going to be a pro, I had to do it now. I missed a cut and came home whining. My wife Kelly said, 'well, you quit your job; you’d better go out and bowl better.’"[6]

After participating in 50 tournaments on the PBA50 Tour without a win, Goebel won his first PBA50 Tour title on May 16, 2017 at the PBA50 Miller Lite Players Championship in Indianapolis. This is considered a major title for PBA50 players. Qualifying as the #2 seed, Goebel defeated top seed and fellow PBA Hall of Famer Parker Bohn III in the final match.[7]
