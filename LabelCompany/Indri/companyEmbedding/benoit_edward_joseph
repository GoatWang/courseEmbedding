 Home→Collections→West HartfordBenoit, Edward JosephMay 14, 2004BENOIT, Edward JosephEdward Joseph Benoit, 97, beloved and devoted husband of Edna Roulier Benoit for 65 years, died Tuesday (May 11, 2004). Born January 18, 1907 in North Adams, MA, son of Joseph and Margaret (Higgins) Benoit, he inherited his musical talent from his father, a drummer who created sound effects for silent movies. Following a dream of becoming a musician like his dad, Ed played with ``Ed Benoit and the Melody Boys'', the violin and viola with chamber groups, and for more than 50 years, the bass violin. His first job, following 9th grade was in a Massachusetts shoe factory. In 1927, at age 20, Ed came to Hartford to work at Royal Typewriter while studying accounting at Hillyer College (now Univ. of Hartford). He met Edna when he joined a string ensemble where she played the violin. Because the group already had two ``Eddies'', he became known as ``Ben'' from then on. Ben and Edna were married in Hartford in 1939 and began their life of making music together. In 1942, with two small daughters, they moved to White Plains, NY. Ben commuted to work in NY City by train every day for the next 10 years and the family grew to five (3 girls and 2 boys). While in White Plains, they played with the Westchester Symphony Orchestra, enjoyed chamber music and formed some life long friendships. Having grown up with 12 brothers and sisters, Ben had learned to cook at an early age and had no trouble pitching in as ``Mr. Mom'' whenever necessary to help Edna care for their five children, his pride and joy. In 1952 the family moved back to West Hartford to be near Edna's aging parents. Having worked a couple of temporary jobs to get by, in 1955 Ben completed a Dale Carnegie course and began his last job as salesman for Luxor/Duro-Test Lighting Products of NY and NJ. With his sense of humor, quiet and reserved manner and belief in his product he became one of their top sales representatives country wide and remained with them for more than 45 years. Ben was diligent and persistent with any task at hand. He would often be seen still working in the garden in the dark to finish whatever he started. A loyal and devout member of St. Peter Claver Church in West Hartford, only illness kept him from Sunday Mass. He was a former member of the New Britain Symphony Orchestra, the Regents and delivered Meals on Wheels. Ben was happiest practicing his bass fiddle, playing chamber music with Edna and their many musical friends, attending Hartford Symphony concerts where Edna played until 1997, enjoying their garden and competing with his neighbor to build the best stone fireplace or see whose tomato was bigger and ripened first; making fudge (the best ever!), baking doughnuts or pies (always 2 or 3 at a time) or chocolate chip cookies (the last batch as recent as 3 weeks ago), and more recently, listening to classical music especially Joshua Bell CD's. A 1997 photo article in the Hartford Courant about Ben was titled ``At 90, lightbulb salesman still shines''. The love he shared and the example he set will continue to shine in our memories. Ben was cherished and will be deeply missed by his children, Madeleine Janes and her husband, Peter B., and Evelyn Benoit and her husband, Tom Goodrum, of West Hartford, Jacqueline Muzio and her husband, Michael, of Ellington, Edward F. and Linda Basset Benoit, of West Tisbury, MA, and John and Suzanne Benoit, of Collinsville; his grandchildren, Katherine, Robert, Maura, Kelly, Gregory, Joshua, Julie, Babette, Christine, and Kenneth, and his seven great-grandchildren, his sisters-in-law, Madeleine Albright, of NYC, and Marie Drake, of West Hartford, and many nieces and nephews, wonderful neighbors and good friends. He was predeceased by his 12 brothers and sisters. A Memorial Mass in celebration of his life will be held at St. Peter Claver Church, 47 Pleasant St., West Hartford, Monday at 10 a.m. Interment will be private and at the convenience of the family. There are no calling hours. Memorial contributions may be made to Audubon Society Connecticut, 185 East Flathill Rd., Southbury, CT 06488 or a charity of the donor's choice. Fisette-Batzner Funeral Home, 20 Bonair Ave., Newington has charge of the arrangements.

BENOIT, Edward Joseph Edward Joseph Benoit, 97, beloved and devoted husband of Edna Roulier Benoit for 65 years, died Tuesday (May 11, 2004).

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.
