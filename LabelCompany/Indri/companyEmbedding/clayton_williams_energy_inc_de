Operations 













Clayton Williams Energy drills primarily developmental oil wells in the liquids-rich areas of the Permian Basin and Giddings Area of Texas.  These oil-prone regions are known as two of the largest resource plays in the United States.  We have large contiguous acreage blocks in both areas and have over 1,000 locations identified for future drilling inventory.  We own and operate 8 drilling rigs that are key to our cost control and provide flexibility in our drilling operations.  Our operations program continues to improve through efficiencies in drilling and completion activities.  With infrastructures in place and a plentiful supply of fresh water, we are well positioned for future developmental drilling activities in both of our core areas.

GUIDANCE DISCLOSURES FOR 2011

 

Overview

 

Clayton
Williams Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries have prepared this
document to provide public disclosure of certain financial and
operating estimates in order to permit the preparation of models to
forecast our operating results for each quarter during the year
ending December 31, 2011.  These estimates are based
on information available to us as of the date of this filing, and
actual results may vary materially from these
estimates.  We do not undertake any obligation to update
these estimates as conditions change or as additional information
becomes available.

 

The
estimates provided in this document are based on assumptions that
we believe are reasonable.  Until our actual results of
operations for these periods have been compiled and released, all
of the estimates and assumptions set forth herein constitute
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.  All statements, other than statements of
historical facts, included in this document that address
activities, events, outcomes and other matters that we plan,
expect, intend, assume, believe, budget, predict, forecast,
project, estimate or anticipate (and other similar expressions)
will, should, could or may occur in the future, including such
matters as production of oil and gas, product prices, oil and gas
reserves, drilling and completion results, capital expenditures,
operating costs and other such matters, are forward-looking
statements.  Such forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may
cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be
materially different from the results, performance, or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements.  Such factors include, among others, the
following:  the volatility of oil and gas prices; the
unpredictable nature of our exploratory drilling results; the
reliance upon estimates of proved reserves; operating hazards and
uninsured risks; competition; government regulation; and other
factors referenced in filings made by us with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY, INC.
ANNOUNCES PRICING OF $300 MILLION OFFERING OF SENIOR
NOTES

 


 


Midland,
Texas, March 11, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) – Clayton Williams Energy, Inc.
(“CWEI”) (NASDAQ-CWEI) announced today the pricing of
its private placement of $300 million aggregate principal amount of
7.75% Senior Notes due 2019.  The notes were sold at 100%
of par to yield 7.75% to maturity.  The offering is
expected to close on March 16, 2011, subject to customary closing
conditions.


 


CWEI intends to
use the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase its
outstanding 7¾% Senior Notes due 2013 pursuant to its
previously announced tender offer, and to repay borrowings under
its revolving credit facility.  To the extent 7¾%
Senior Notes are not tendered in the tender offer, CWEI intends to
use the net proceeds from the offering, in its discretion, to repay
or refinance outstanding indebtedness and/or for general corporate
purposes.


 


The notes have
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”) or any state securities laws; and
unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United
States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws.


 


This press
release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities
Act, and is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer
to buy the notes or any other securities and shall not constitute
an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a sale
of, the notes or any other securities in any jurisdiction in which
such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.


 


This release
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  All statements, other than
