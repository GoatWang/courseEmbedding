Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Brien has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for California.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Brien's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Brien's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Brien is Board Certified in:Orthopedic SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.

I must say Dr. Wyatt is the best!! I am in the cosmetic industry and have been for the last 9 years. I see it all! Good and bad results. I have had other doctors in the past do my BOTOX and I was never satisfied. Dr. Wyatt has the experience and has been administrating Botox for over 10 years and always treats patients himself. It’s nice to know when you walk in his office that he will be administrating the treatment. When Dr. Wyatt does my BOTOX, he makes me feel at ease and guides me through the process. I have referred patients to him and they always have great reviews.  Some of them have even hosted BOTOX parties to introduce Dr. Wyatt to their family and friends. He was also featured ABC news and 20/20 news treating patients with BOTOX. Dr. Wyatt has also treated me with Juvederm and I am satisfied with his artistry and skill. Dr. Wyatt knows exactly what he is doing and I know that my results will be fantastic like always! Thanks’ Dr. Wyatt!!!Gary Chen MDChris W. ratedOver a year ago I came into the office, to have my elbow (basically repaired). A major injury..........to my elbow, arm, etc. Dr. Chen and his staff.........did a excellent job of getting me back. Surgery, etc........., was perfect. PT ended up, helping me...and the office and staff have continued with my process of getting me back to close to 100%.Overall medical is a pretty slow, and patience is a must.  Sometimes that alone can be a headache, But the overall experience with the Dr...., ended up being the most important thing. Arm or elbow will always have issues, due to age, and nature of injury.............overall it could be worse.With the help of Dr Chen, I can move on in life with a repaired arm/elbow and use it almost as if the injury didn't happen.I would truly give him and his staff, overall 5 stars.Merritt, HelenBret R. ratedWhenever you need a doctor, especially one that looks after precious things like your eyes, you want the best and Dr. Merritt is at the top of that list.  She doesn't overload with patients and takes as much time as you need.  She cheerfully answers questions and explains in detail the procedure and what comes after.  I had a rather large lump on each eyelid, caused by a blocked duct, and we first tried non-surgical treatment but that didn't work.  So I opted for an in-patient surgical procedure and that did the trick.  She was very thorough and careful.  A few days after treatment she sent me a note to follow up to see how I was doing -- never had a doctor do that before.  Really, really happy to have found her and when I need an eye doctor in future I wouldn't think of seeing anyone else.Dayani Nader DDSZ A. ratedI came many years ago to your office, I did not have low self esteem, but it was not where I wanted it to be. My teeth always bothered me growing up and into my adult years. Some people say straight teeth are over-rated, but your teeth say so much about yourself; if you care about your health, your appearance and most of all, how you look and feel about yourself.You cannot put a price tag on your health or self esteem.Dr. Dayani, you have taken my dream and turned it into my reality: perfectly straight teeth. For this I wanted to say thank you to you and all of your staff.Dr. Dayani, you don’t just change smiles, you change lives, for mine will never be the same. When I think teeth, I think Braces America. You guys are great.Dr. Myles J Cohen, MDBonnie B. ratedYou've hit 'THE JACKPOT' when you choose Dr Cohen as your surgeon!! At some point in all our lives, you or someone close to you will need major surgery--no matter the reason .Dr. Cohen is not only a gifted  surgeon and oncologist (ie. cancer specialist), he is 'Iconic' and without a doubt a true healer! Bottom Line...Dr. Cohen is the 'Patch Adams' of surgeons and medicine in Los Angeles. His entire staff, his office, his caring patient service is 'above and beyond'....Plus, alike Patch Adams, you'll laughall the way to surgery and after!  Healing is a pleasure when you choose this remarkable surgical  artist! BTW--He paints, he's a real comic and he honors his patients as he treats them all like 'family'!Coghlan Patricia MDmillerderm ratedLOS ANGELES OFFICE FOR H MICHAEL MILLER MDDr Miller is practicing  both medical and cosmetic dermatology in his new office at 1127 Wilshire Blvd #403 Los Angeles CA.

H Michael Miller MDChiu, Harvey KAmy L. ratedMy family was introduced to Dr. Chiu when my son turned 7 days old. That was over 2 & 1/2 years ago when we found out he was born without his thyroid. From the very first calls and visits Dr. Chiu and his staff made sure both my husband and myself were educated with regards to what this would mean for my son and our family. At each and every visit, Dr. Chiu makes sure we have all of our questions answered and has never made me feel rushed. My son has always taken a liking to Dr. Chiu as well.I feel really lucky to have had the expertise of UCLA Health to help with the unknown territory of dealing with our sons condition and highly recommend Dr. Chiu.Merritt, Helennewrhodes ratedToday is June 12, 2017. Last Monday, at the suggestion of Dr. Do at the LA County/USC Medical Center, I underwent surgery on my eyes. The surgeons were Doctors Ananth  Sastry and Helen Merritt. The surgery was a major success. I was totally surprised when I received a call from Doctor Sastry at 9:00 PM Tuesday evening to check to see how I was feeling. These three people are super physicians! Each one of them should wear scrubs with a big "S" on their chests and capes!! I would be willing to die and go to purgatory for them! They are SUPER!! Thank you Doctors!!!!     Ambassador Steve Rhodes - 323-383-2445.Merritt, HelenFarah E. ratedI've been blessed to have found Dr. Merritt. Dr. Merritt performed  a surgical procedure to replace my tear duct. due to blockage of my tear duct.  Everything went well pre-op and post-op. She has really good beside manners and she took her time to listen to my concerns and explain the entire procedure, and what to expect before and after surgery. I just love her and I'm thankful to have found her to perform my surgery.  I took my five year to follow ups and he said "he wants to be a doctor, so he can help people and make them happy" :) Thank you Dr. Merritt for taking care of me.Rebecca Fitzgerald MD Inc.keiram ratedOk, I have mad love for the do...Ok, I have mad love for the doctors in my life. (I know I'm a little biased as I am in pre-med). But seriously, Rebecca is the bee's knees. I dealt with adult acne for a while and it seemed that every derm I went and saw continued to point me to remedies for adult acne! SO not the same thing, people!!! Rebecca has a full understanding of her craft and I'm so thankful to have found her. Any bad reviews her clearly aren't concentrating on the real reason you go see a derm: TO GET YOUR SKIN FIXED. And that is exactly what she does. You'd be a fool not to see her.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:   CYTR), a biopharmaceutical research and development company specializing in oncology, today announced the appointment of Earl Warren Brien, M.D., a noted sarcoma surgeon, industry consultant, and private healthcare investor, to its Board of Directors.








"Dr. Brien is a healthcare leader with clinical and strategic experience at the highest level," said Steven A. Kriegsman, CytRx's Chairman and CEO. "As one of the world's leading orthopedic surgeons, Dr. Brien has performed thousands of sarcoma-related surgeries over the course of his career.  He brings a wealth of knowledge to CytRx through his first-hand experience in treating patients with soft tissue sarcomas coupled with years of providing strategic counsel to both biotech and medical device companies.  On behalf of the entire Board and management team, I welcome him and look forward to his contributions as we advance aldoxorubicin toward a New Drug Application (NDA) filing for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas."
Dr. Brien commented, "My background and deep familiarity with sarcoma, both as a surgeon and a collaborator with treating sarcoma physicians, enables me to bring a unique, real world perspective to CytRx and I am delighted to join its Board of Directors and to work closely with this world-class scientific and entrepreneurial team.  With positive Phase 3 results now in hand, I believe aldoxorubicin represents a major step forward for sarcoma patients and I look forward to making contributions that will assist in bringing this promising new treatment candidate to patients suffering with this rare, complex and difficult-to-treat cancer."
Dr. Brien is a board certified orthopedic and sarcoma surgeon who currently serves as a Professor of Orthopedic Surgery and Surgical Director of the Sarcoma Service at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.  He earned his medical degree from Howard University School of Medicine and completed fellowships at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Orthopedic Oncology and at the Hospital for Special Surgery at Cornell University.  Over his more than twenty-year career, Dr. Brien has received numerous research grants, given over 140 scientific presentations, and been published in numerous peer-reviewed journals and books.
