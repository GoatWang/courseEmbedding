Tombstone Super Project (TSP)  initially consisted of 33 unpatented federal lode mining claims over a projected covered porphyry copper mineral center in south east Arizona. In  September, 2011 more claims covering  approximately eight square miles were added after Chief Geologist James Briscoe discovered a large multimodal anomaly over a large covered porphyry copper mineral center within the larger TSP area. In 2011 geochemical studies indicated the potential for three rare earth elements. The Hay Mountain Project within the TSP is Liberty Star’s premier property.

The purpose as indicated by the name is to reconnoiter large areas at low cost.
Rockbolting – The act of supporting openings in rock with steel bolts anchored in holes drilled especially for this purpose.
Rockburst – A violent release of energy resulting in the sudden failure of walls or pillars in a mine, caused by the weight or pressure of the surrounding rocks.

Rock mechanics – The study of the mechanical properties of rocks, which includes stress conditions around mine openings and the ability of rocks and underground structures to withstand these stresses.
Rod mill – A rotating steel cylinder that uses steel rods as a means of grinding ore.
Room-and-pillar mining – A type of open stoping wherein pillars are left in place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out, starting at the farthest point from the mine haulage exit, retreating, and letting the roof come down upon the floor. Room and pillar mining is well adapted to mechanization, and is commonly used in flat or gently dipping bedded deposits such as coal, potash, phosphate, salt, oil, shale, and bedded uranium ores.
Rotary drill – A machine that drills holes by rotating a rigid, tubular string of drill rods to which is attached a bit. Cuttings are flushed out of the bit, while cooling the bit, and brought to the surface by air or water-mud circulation. Commonly used for drilling large-diameter blast holes in open pit mines, as well oil well and water well drilling. For sampling mineral deposits, air circulation is preferably used above the water table. In rotary drilling, samples are chips and pulverized rock produced by the abrasive and chipping action of the drill bit.
Rotary reverse circulation (RC) drilling – RC drilling is similar to air drilling, in that the drill cuttings are returned to surface inside the rods. The drilling mechanism can be a tricone bit but now more commonly is a pneumatic reciprocating piston known as a “hammer” driving a tungsten-steel drill bit. RC drilling utilizes much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to 500 meters are routinely achieved. Ideally, produces dry-rock chips above the water table.  Penetration below the water table is difficult because the heavy water is difficult for the air stream to lift and the hole generally “waters out” quickly.  Then the drilling would have to proceed with a water-mud circulation which generally results in an inferior mineral sample.See Intro to RC drilling [Atlas Copco PDF]
Royalty – An amount of money paid at regular intervals by the lessee or operator of an exploration or mining property to the owner of the ground. Generally based on a certain amount per ton or a percentage of the total production or profits. Also, the fee paid for the right to use a patented process.

Short ton – 2,000 lb avoirdupois.
Shrinkage stoping – A mining method wherein the ore deposit is stoped from beneath, allowing broken ore to support the stope walls, but leaving a space above the broken ore just sufficient for the miners to stand on and drill overhead. Broken ore is drawn as necessary to maintain this headroom, and becasue the volume of rock expands upon breaking, about a third of the broken ore is drawn from beneath as stoping progresses from the bottom of the ore block to the top. After the stope is completed, all broken ore is removed and the walls are allowed to cave in. The wall rock must be strong enough to support itself during shrinkage stoping, without breaking away and becoming mixed with the broken ore. Steeply dipping veins with well-defined, hard walls are most suitable for shrinkage stoping.

Spot market – The buying and selling of uranium products for delivery within one year.
Square set – A cubic frame of timber used to support the walls and roof of a stope.
Square-set stoping – A mining method wherein small blocks of ore are removed and replaced by a square set which is immediately set into place. The timber sets interlock and are filled with broken waste rock or sand fill, for they are not strong enough to support the stope walls. The waste rock or sand is usually added after one tier of sets, or stope cut, is made. Square-set stoping is used where the ore is weak, and the walls are not strong enough to support themselves. The value of the ore must be relatively high, for square-setting is slow, expensive, and requires highly skilled miners and supervisors.

Uranium – A heavy, naturally radioactive, metallic element (atomic number 92). Its two principally occurring isotopes are 235U and 238U. The isotope 235U is indispensable to the nuclear industry because it is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissionable by thermal neutrons. The isotope 238U is also important because it absorbs neutrons to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decays to the isotope 239Pu, which also is fissionable by thermal neutrons.
Uranium concentrate – A yellow or brown powder obtained by the milling of uranium ore, processing of in situ leach mining solutions, or as a byproduct of phosphoric acid production.
Uranium deposit – A discrete concentration of uranium mineralization that is of possible economic interest.
Uranium Deposit Types – See below
Unconformity-Related Uranium Deposits – Unconformity related deposits are related to breaks in the stratigraphic record, or “unconformities”. These breaks generally occur around the contact between >500 million year old permeable sedimentary basins which sit above a uranium-enriched, carbon-rich hard rock basement that has been weathered and usually structurally deformed. The deposits can be in the basin, at the contact between basin and basement, or in the upper part of the basement rocks themselves. Major fault systems and hydrothermal fluids provide the other key ingredients to create deposits. Unconformity deposits can have very high grades of uranium (20% and beyond), and in 2004 deposits of this type produced over 40% the worlds uranium.
Sandstone Uranium Deposits – Sandstone uranium deposits are typically formed in continental clastic basins with complex, deformed stratigraphy and structure. They are a result of the chemical transport of uranium but the source and time of emplacement is typically not known. They can form as tabular or lens-shaped bodies, roll-fronts, or channels within the host rock. Permeability of the sandstone, and efficient dissolution and deposition mechanisms all influence the formation of deposits. Grades for this deposit type are typically 0.15 — 0.4% U308 and deposits are usually small to medium sized but numerous within an area. Sandstone uranium deposits are widely distributed around the world and produced more than 11 % of global production in 2004. Niger, Kazakhstan, USA, and Australia were some of the leading producers of uranium from sandstone deposits.
Iron Oxide Copper-Gold (IOCG) Uranium Deposits – The IOCG deposit is a complex type of system that is often mined for copper and gold but can also contain a significant amount of uranium. This type of deposit is typified by its main example, the world’s largest uranium deposit, Olympic Dam. Olympic Dam contains approximately 1 billion pounds of U308 in reserve and produced more than 9% of the world’s uranium in 2004. The Olympic Dam deposit formed when hot mineral- rich fluids from a deep source penetrated a higher granite host rock to cause brecciation and mineral deposition. Olympic Dam is localized at the intersection of major structures and has an associated magnetic and gravity anomaly. Mineralization includes copper, uranium, gold, silver, light rare earth elements and iron oxides. The age of the Olympic Dam host rocks and deposit are the same and are comparable to the ages of the Central Mineral Belt uranium district.
Pegmatite-Intrusive (Rossing-style) Uranium Deposits – Rio Tinto’s Rossing pegmatite-intrusive deposit in Namibia produces nearly 8% of the world’s uranium annually. Rossing is a world class deposit and an important model for uranium exploration globally, including Labrador’s Central Mineral Belt (CMB). The Rossing deposit is characterized by disseminated uranium mineralization (dominantly uraninite) in a granite-like rock body in areas that have been subjected to intense metamorphism. Copper sulphides, molybdenite, arsenopyrite, iron oxides and fluorite are often associated with the ore. The deposit and others in its class are considered to possibly represent the deeper geologic equivalents of the higher level Olympic Dam-IOCG model. Therefore, the two models can both be applied in certain uranium districts, such as the CMB.
Uranium endowment – The uranium that is estimated to occur in rock with a grade of at least 0.01 percent U3O8. The estimate of the uranium endowment is made before consideration of economic availability and any associated uranium resources.
Uranium hexafluoride (UF6) – A white solid obtained by chemical treatment of U3O8 and which forms a vapor at temperatures above 56 degrees Centigrade. UF6 is the form of uranium required for the enrichment process.
Uranium ore – Rock containing uranium mineralization in concentrations that can be mined economically, (typically 1 to 4 pounds of U3O8 per ton or 0.05 to 0.20 percent U3O8).
Uranium oxide – Uranium concentrate or yellowcake. Abbreviated as U3O8.
Uranium property – A specific tract of land with known uranium reserves that could be developed for mining.
Uranium reserves – Estimated quantities of uranium in known mineral deposits of such size, grade, and configuration that the uranium could be recovered at or below a specified production cost with currently proven mining and processing technology and under current law and regulations. Reserves are based on direct radiometric and chemical measurements of drill hole and other types of sampling of the deposits. Mineral grades and thickness, spatial relationships, depths below the surface, mining and reclamation methods, distances to milling facilities, and amenability of ores to processing are considered in the evaluation. The amounts of uranium in ore that could be exploited within the chosen forward-cost levels are estimated utilizing available sampling, engineering, geologic, and economic data in accordance with conventional engineering practices.
Uranium resources categories – Three categories of uranium resources are used to reflect differing levels of confidence in the resources reported. Reasonably assured resources (RAR), estimated additional resources (EAR), and speculative resources (SR) are described below.
Reasonably assured resources (RAR): The uranium that occurs in known mineral deposits of such size, grade, and configuration that it could be recovered within the given production cost ranges, with currently proven mining and processing technology. Estimates of tonnage and grade are based on specific sample data and measurements of the deposits and on knowledge of deposit characteristics. RAR correspond to DOE’s uranium reserves category.
Estimated additional resources (EAR): The uranium in addition to RAR that is expected to occur, mostly on the basis of direct geological evidence, in extensions of well-explored deposits, little explored deposits, and undiscovered deposits believed to exist along well-defined geological trends with known deposits, such that the uranium can subsequently be recovered within the given cost ranges. Estimates of tonnage and grade are based on available sampling data and on knowledge of the deposit characteristics, as determined in the best-known parts of the deposit or in similar deposits. EAR correspond to DOE’s probable potential resources category.
Speculative resources (SR): Uranium in addition to EAR that is thought to exist, mostly on the basis of indirect evidence and geological extrapolations, in deposits discoverable with existing exploration techniques. The locations of deposits in this category can generally be specified only as being somewhere within given regions or geological trends. The estimates in this category are less reliable than estimates of RAR and EAR. The category of SR corresponds to DOE’s possible potential resources plus speculative potential resources categories combined.
Usage Agreement – Contracts held by enrichment customers that allow feed material to be stored at the enrichment plant site in advance of need.
V
Vein – A fissure, fault or crack in a rock filled by minerals that have traveled upwards from some deep source.
Vendor – A seller. In the case of mining companies, the consideration paid for properties purchased is often a block of treasury shares. These shares are termed vendor shares and are normally pooled or escrowed.
Visible gold – Native gold that is discernible, in a hand specimen, to the unaided eye.
Volcanic rocks – Igneous rocks formed from magma that has flowed out or has been violently ejected from a volcano.
Volcaniclastic – Pertaining to a clastic rock containing volcanic material in whatever proportion, and without regard to its origin or environment.

Writeoffs – Amounts deducted from a company’s reported profit for depreciation or preproduction costs. Writeoffs are not an out-of-pocket expense but reduce the amount of taxable profit.
X
Xenolith – A fragment of country rock enclosed in an intrusive rock.
Y
Yellowcake – A natural uranium concentrate that takes its name from its color and texture. Yellowcake typically contains 70 to 90 percent U3O8 by weight. It is used as feedstock for uranium fuel enrichment and fuel pellet fabrication.(See uranium oxide).

These outstanding exploration geologists were mentors to CEO/Chief Geologist Jim Briscoe early in his career.
 
James Harold Courtright “James Harold Courtright was an extraordinary exploration geologist. He teamed up with his life-long colleague and friend Kenyon E. Richard to produce an exploration record for ASARCO Incorporated that was described in the 1995 Arizona Geological Society Digest 20 as “…the all-time most successful porphyry copper program.”  https://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee/courtright
 
Kenyon E. Richard “Kenyon Richard was born in San Francisco and graduated magna cum laude from the University of Nevada, Reno, in 1937. He then joined the E. N. Pennybaker exploration team with Consolidated Coppermines Corp. at Ely, Nevada, as a geologist, and in 1941 he hired Harold Courtright. In 1945, Kenyon and Harold joined American Smelting and Refining Co. in Salt Lake City as exploration geologists. They were destined to become perhaps the most famous and successful team in the history of mineral exploration.” https://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee/richard
 





 Lowell – Guilbert Porphyry Copper Model
 
 
Fig. 1 Lowell and Guilbert, 1970
“Porphyry copper deposits, in idealized form (Fig. 1), are each centered on an igneous intrusion composed of porphyry, which is a fine grained granitic rock with larger crystals of feldspar. The porphyry is surrounded by concentric shells containing different mineral assemblages that reflect the conditions of hydrothermal alteration and mineralization at the time that the magma was intruded and crystallized to form the porphyry. Copper is typically concentrated at a specific zone within these concentric alteration-mineral assemblages. This model has been used to help find porphyry copper deposits where only parts of the alteration zones have been located. The idealized porphyry copper model was identified by J. David Lowell, an exploration geologist working on the San Manuel porphyry copper deposit north of Tucson, and University of Arizona geology professor John Guilbert.” From Arizona Geology and New Concepts in Geosciences, AZGS, 2013

Projects 






Tombstone Super Project (TSP)  initially consisted of 33 unpatented federal lode mining claims over a projected covered porphyry copper mineral center in south east Arizona. In  September, 2011 more claims covering  approximately eight square miles were added after Chief Geologist James Briscoe discovered a large multimodal anomaly over a large covered porphyry copper mineral center within the larger TSP area. In 2011 geochemical studies indicated the potential for three rare earth elements. The Hay Mountain Project within the TSP is Liberty Star’s premier property.

 ============================================================================================================= (Blue 4 Posted This Section)    Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. (LBSR: OTCQB) is an Arizona-based mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the states of Arizona and Alaska. Currently the company controls  properties totaling approximately 26,011 acres (about 41 square miles) which are located over what management considers some of North America’s richest mineralized regions for copper, gold, silver, molybdenum (moly), and uranium.   Read more                                                                                                    Hay Mountain Summary (PDF)    Hay Mountain/Tombstone Super Project  Geochem Field Tech, August, 2011  The Tombstone Super Project (TSP ) hosts Liberty Star’s premiere multi target property: Hay Mountain. The TSP initially consisted of 33 unpatented federal lode mining claims over a projected covered porphyry copper mineral center in Cochise County, Arizona. In 2011 and 2012 more USBLM claims and Arizona Mining Exploration Permits were added after Chief Geologist James Briscoe discovered a large multimodal anomaly over a large covered porphyry copper mineral center within the larger TSP area. Currently,  the TSP entails 14.67 square miles of claimed or permitted lands with  Hay Mountain covering 13.45 square miles of the area. Mining throughout the region began in the late 19th Century and led to the rise of legendary boom town Tombstone, Arizona. Many of these mining sites, including what is now Liberty Star’s land, reside within or adjacent to a large volcanic and intrusive geologic feature known as a caldera. These caldera structures are present throughout southern Arizona, making the region one of the richest porphyry copper areas on the planet. By 1938 exploration and development of the Tombstone Mining District in this area was stalled by altered sedimentary rock (hornfels) that was too hard for the drill technology of the day(churn drills). With copper prices on a continued upward trajectory, and modern mining technology in place, the terrain along this large caldera is again of great interest throughout the mining industry. Through geochemical sampling and computer modeling, Liberty Star founder and Chief Geologist & CEO James Briscoe, discovered a compelling drill target for a very large limestone hosted porphyry copper-replacement deposit. If exploration is successful, mining projected for this target would be underground and could produce copper, moly, gold, silver, lead, zinc and potentially other by product metals. While there are no drilled mineral resources on this property, it is adjacent to the old historic Tombstone Consolidated mines and the target is defined by technical work to allow an immediate start to drill testing. The Tombstone mining district has a well developed infrastructure and enjoys sunny skies over 300 days a year, ideal for year round exploration and mining activities. In mid March, 2011 Liberty Star contracted SRK Consulting to prepare  technical reports over three areas within the Tombstone Super Project : Hay Mountain, Tombstone South and Walnut Creek. Members of SRK’s engineering/scientific staff supervised by Qualified Person and SRK’s Tucson Office Principle Geologist Corolla Hoag, and geologist Dr. Jan Rasmussen have visited the Tombstone property. Their information combined with the previously gathered geochemical, geophysical and computer modeling data  underwent a thorough technical analysis. The resulting technical reports concluded that all three claim blocks were worthy of further exploration work. In 2011 extensive geochemical sampling at Hay Mountain rendered approximately 1,800 soil/rock/vegetation samples which were analyzed for 64 elements at a certified facility in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Expected  markers for porphyry copper, gold, moly, silver and zinc were present. The geochemical data also yielded the unexpected presence of  four of seventeen Rare Earth Elements (REEs). Further analysis of the REE data will be undertaken at a later date. Liberty Star contracted  Geotech Ltd. to run a ZTEM airborne electromagnetic survey over the Hay Mountain area in 2013. The final draft report has been submitted to Liberty Star concluding : 1. There are as many as 10 meaningful targets within the Hay Mountain Project area. 2. Hay Mountain contains a major anomaly centered on the geochem anomaly reported by Liberty Star (NR 127). From the “Executive Summary” Summary Interpretation Report on a Helicopter-Borne Z-Axis Tipper Electromagnetic (ZTEM) and Aeromagnetic Geophysical Survey:  The Hay Mountain Project Tombstone Mining District, Cochise County, Arizona For: Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp.: “The Hay Mountain Property is mainly underlain by a thick sequence of Paleozoic quartzite, limestone and siltstones, but potentially hosts buried porphyry copper deposits at structural intersections and under basin-fill formations. There is additional potential for polymetallic carbonate-hosted replacement deposits (CRD), as well as shallow chalcocite blanket porphyry type deposits and also skarn type porphyry copper deposits. Previous soil and vegetation geochemical surveys have identified a coincident Au-Pb-Cu anomaly and larger Mo-halo in the center of the property. The objective of the ZTEM surveys is to identify favourable magnetic and resistivity signatures related to potentially more deeply buried porphyry copper, CRD/skarn and chalcocite replacement deposits at Hay Mountain. The Magnetic surveys have determined that Hay Mountain hosts a large dominant magnetic high that lies buried below the Paleozoic sediments is centered over the Liberty Star geochemical anomaly and remains open to the south…As many as ten (10) magnetic anomalies have been defined.” (See NR 170, 12/11/2013)  View  TSP/Hay Mtn ZTEM & Maps (web page) View the May 2013 Hay Mtn Summary Presentation (PDF) View the Feb 2013 Archaeological Study (PDF)     TSP/Hay Mtn ZTEM & Maps  Mag3D Magnetic Inversion Feb 2014   L1410 ZTEM 2D Inversion Resistivity Section Feb 2014   LSUM ZTEM composite Jan 21, 2014   Hay Mtn geochem anomalies w/ drill targets and geochem sample locations   Hay Mtn geochem samples & results (2003-2011)   Hay Mtn property local Cu and Au mines   Southeast Arizona Cu and Au mining district                     JMG Porphyry Copper Model    Tombstone Porphyry-Precious Metals Project consists of 33 unpatented federal lode mining claims over a projected covered porphyry copper mineral center in Cochise County, Arizona. Mining throughout the region began in the late 19th Century and led to the rise of legendary boomtown Tombstone, Arizona. Many of these mining sites, including what is now Liberty Star's land, reside within a large volcanic and intrusive geologic feature known as a  caldera. These caldera structures are present throughout southern Arizona, making the region one of the richest  porphyry copper areas on the planet. Fuller exploration and development of the Tombstone Mining District was stalled by altered sedimentary rock that was too hard for the drill technology of the day. With copper prices on a continued upward trajectory, and modern mining technology in place, the terrain along this large caldera is again of great interest to the international mining community. Through geochemical sampling and computer modeling, Liberty Star founder and CEO James Briscoe, discovered a compelling drill target for a very large limestone hosted porphyry copper-replacement deposit. If exploration is successful, mining projected for this target would be underground and could produce copper, moly, gold, silver, lead, and zinc. While there are no drilled mineral resources on this property, it is adjacent to the old historic Tombstone Consolidated mines and the target is defined by technical work to allow an immediate start to drill testing. http://www.libertystaruranium.com/www/projects/tombstone-project East Silver Bell Porphyry Copper Project is within the Silver Bell Mining District located northwest of Tucson, Arizona. Asarco Mining LLC with joint venture partner Mitsui Mining of Japan currently operates open pit copper mines in the area. Asarco has a solvent extraction (SXEW) plant approximately 4 1/2 miles to the west of the East Silver Bell Project property line. Liberty Star's property, within the same mining district, includes 26 unpatented lode mining claims covering a previously unrecognized porphyry copper center. Two mining companies had some interest in the area during the late 1990s but relinquished the ground despite revealing enriched copper in one hole and substantial amounts of leached capping in all other holes, an indicator for porphyry copper deposits. Stagnant copper prices contributed to the abandonment of the ground prior to the identification of any ore body. The claims currently are within the Ironwood National Monument, which was established after the claims were staked. http://www.libertystaruranium.com/www/projects/east-silver-bell-porphyry-copper-project  Big Chunk Super Project      At a glance            Property rights Exclusive mineral exploration rights held by wholly-owned Alaskan subsidiary Big Chunk Corp   Location Approximately 200 miles southwest of Anchorage on the north side of Cook Inlet   Area 54 State mining claims on 12 square miles (7,680 acres) in 2 blocks   Metals sought Copper, gold, molybdenum (moly), silver and zinc   Status Exploration            About the company   Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. is a mineral exploration company led by James A. Briscoe a licensed, experienced Professional Geologist. The Big Chunk Super Project consists of 54 State of Alaska 160-acre mining claims, covering approximately 12 square miles of southwest Alaska. The Big Chunk claims were initially staked in 2003 after Mr. Briscoe recognized that a caldera which was probably responsible for hosting Northern Dynasty Minerals’ Pebble discovery was strikingly similar to the caldera hosting the Silver Bell mining district in southern Arizona, where he had worked as a geologist in the 1960’s and again in the 1990’s. As  August, 2012  Liberty Star has commenced exploratory drilling on the BCSP, south block.   The phase 1 drilling plan retrieved core from  depths extending to 1,696 feet. Well-located Liberty Star’s ground is located near year-round ice-free tidewater on the Pacific Ocean at Cook Inlet. Known mineralization in this area occurs near surface in an area of gentle topography and low elevations. The Pebble Project, a joint venture between Northern Dynasty Minerals and mining industry giant AngloGold seeks to construct and operate an open pit and underground mine in an area considered one of the richest for porphyry gold, copper and molybdenum in the world. Further development of a port on the Cook Inlet, nearby roads, and suitable energy sources are already in process with the approval of the State of Alaska and the Federal Government. Exploration Summary In May 2010 Liberty Star announced that its geophysical contractor (Geotech Ltd.) had confirmed multiple porphyry copper ZTEM geophysical signatures in Big Chunk’s south claim-block.  In August 2012 Liberty Star began drilling in the BCSP south block. 2009 ZTEM Surveys In June 2009 Liberty Star contracted Geotech Ltd. (a Canadian based full service contractor specializing in airborne geophysical surveys) to participate in performing assessment work required by the Alaska Bureau of Mineral Resources for the assessment year 2009/2010 on the Big Chunk Super Project. At the request of Mr. Briscoe, Geotech Ltd. executed a full ZTEM program over the south block of the Big Chunk claims. ZTEM (Z Axis Tipper Electromagnetic System) is a helicopter borne survey method measuring electromagnetic activity. Geotech’s technology and sensitive measuring equipment enables detection and modeling of the shape of metallic mineral bodies at more than two kilometers (3,300 feet) below the surface. Conducted in August 2009, the survey consisted of 1,256 line km (780 line miles) of ZTEM and very detailed airborne magnetics. The survey lines were spaced 250 meters (825 feet) apart. In April 2010 Liberty Star received initial word from Geotech that the 1D models resulting from the ZTEM surveys confirmed Mr. Briscoe’s projections for multiple porphyry centers and associated Carlin Style and Round Mountain Style stand-alone gold deposits to be discovered within the Big Chunk caldera. By May 2010 Geotech had presented the results of computer processing derived from the ZTEM data; the results were a 2D inversion which allows for a three dimensional approximation of the porphyry systems present in the south block of the Big Chunk Super Project. With the ZTEM data in hand, Mr. Briscoe, Liberty Star’s Chief Geologist, collaborated with other experienced geology specialists to analyze all existing geologic, geochemical, and geophysical data sets compiled from the 2004-2009 exploration work. Commented Mr. Briscoe, “Over the last six years we have carefully gathered across the entire Big Chunk caldera some 11 thousand geochem samples and assayed them for 64 elements each, completed low level high resolution aeromagnetics and compiled base geology. Additionally, we have completed over 140 miles of ground based IP geophysics. All of this data is in digital format and can be compared and interpreted together at the same scale. The new ZTEM data for the Big Chunk Super Project-South Block will be another step in our meticulous exploration process. Along with all the preceding studies, it will be used to refine and pinpoint what these mutually reinforcing data appear to show – anomalies that are characteristic of large porphyry copper mineral bodies, which may contain significant mineralization. Accurately placed drill holes to test these mutually reinforcing data will be the final step in testing for the presence of significant mineralization.” In May 2010 Liberty Star received word from Geotech Ltd. that their interpretation showed at least 6 to 7 signatures that are consistent with porphyry copper responses. Stated in their report: “Comparison against ZTEM 2D resistivity inversion results have defined resistivity features that resemble typical potassic-altered core and pyritic-propylitic halos over known porphyry systems, extending to great depth ( 2 km or about 6562 feet).” These anomalies are in the size range of the footprint of the nearby Pebble deposit(s), also within the Big Chunk caldera, and go to significant depth. Also stated in the report “Porphyry coppers… tend to be associated with pronounced resistivity highs associated with a potassium rich altered core, surrounded by resistivity lows associated with pyrite propylitic alteration halos (i.e. Mt Milligan, San Juan-Lone Star, Morrison etc.).” Geotech’s conclusions are consistent with the Porphyry Copper Model, which Company Director Dr. John Guilbert co-developed and is described and illustrated in his book, Geology of Ore Deposits.  In June, 2012 Geotech delivered enhance imagery of the ZTEM surveyed area that added a more detailed understanding of the terrain. 2004 – 2005 Exploration Program and Results Initial staking & aeromag Liberty Star staked the property in December 2003. An aeromag survey was flown over the property in January through May, 2004. Field work, including surface sampling, Induced Polarization (IP) geophysics, and drilling, was conducted from June through October 2004. The aeromag survey was flown in January through May 2004 by McPhar Geophysics with the use of a fixed-wing aircraft. The survey covered approximately 1,407 square miles. It was flown at 820 foot line spacing and an optimum elevation of 395 feet; both of these controls lead to a highly detailed survey. Surface sampling A majority of the 2004 field work was surface sampling. The table below summarizes the number of samples collected during this work. Water samples were collected and analyzed for fluorine in a field lab, for rapid response to fluorine anomalies.    Sample Type # of samples   Vegetation 4,274   Soil 3,366   Water 993   Stream Sediment 610   Rock 60   Total 9,303    Ground geophysics Thirty days of both dipole-dipole and Reconnaissance IP (RIP) was conducted in August and September 2004. Approximately 26 miles of dipole-dipole was completed and 30 RIP stations were measured, over an area of 13 square miles. A few small areas of IP response were detected with the RIP survey. IP response was measured on all four IP lines at White Sox. These results indicate the presence of disseminated metallic material with consistent readings above 30 msec or mrad. Drilling Four drill holes, totaling 1329 feet, were completed in the White Sox area. Visible copper mineralization was noted in two holes and visible molybdenite was noted in several places in one hole. Low grade gold was also encountered with the other mineral intercepts. This mineralization and the associated alteration may be indicative of a copper porphyry system. 2005 Exploration Program The Big Chunk property is in various stages of exploration. The White Sox area has received the most work and is a little more advanced than other portions of the property. A mineralized center has been identified with drilling and geophysics there. Additional drilling on and near the IP response is planned. Four months of planned IP should fully delineate the IP response at White Sox with additional IP planned to the north, east and south of the 2004 survey. The company proposes to continue to drill to evaluate those areas where the appropriate IP response is >30 mRad. If ore-grade mineralization is encountered, the company hopes to initiate a grid drilling program to delineate resources, if and as time in the season allows.The company proposes to conduct dipole-dipole and reconnaissance IP on the remainder of the property. Any higher quality geochemical anomalies will be evaluated with dipole-dipole IP. If time in the season permits, the company intends to drill test dipole-dipole IP responses over 40 mRad, if any are detected.The company intends to evaluate lower quality geochemical anomalies with RIP and to detail any RIP anomalies with dipole-dipole IP. Read about “The Acquisition of  Big Chunk“     North Pipes Super Project     Location: Northern Arizona Claims: 390 Federal Lode Mining Claims in numerous targeted blocks, or “breccia pipes” (13.13 square miles) Ownership: Claims are 100% owned by Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. (Subject to no royalties) Status: Drilling Program December, 2007 through January, 2008 Photos: Click Here After geologic research spanning a period of about four months, in the fall of 2003 we initiated an aggressive program of ground acquisition. As of September 2013, we have 390 standard Federal lode mining claims, in numerous separate blocks covering breccia pipe targets located on the Colorado Plateau Province of Northern Arizona known as the Arizona Strip. This major project is known as the North Pipes Super Project, and is targeted specifically for high-grade uranium mineralization. Jim Briscoe,CEO, Chief Geologist and Chairman of the Board, developed uranium exploration experience from 1978 through 1980 when his consulting company was under contract with the exploration subsidiary of the largest nuclear electric utility in the U.S.A. His company had responsibility for uranium exploration over the entire state of New Mexico. Based on this experience, he started a thorough research program in late 2003 to determine the prospects of exploration on the Colorado Plateau. Using a multifaceted approach, Liberty Star geologists, along with the help of a very talented geologic expert particularly familiar with these breccia pipes identified the breccia pipe targets that we have staked starting in the fall of 2004. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the breccia pipes in this region are of high grade compared to sediment hosted roll front deposits mined throughout the western US, with an estimated potential average grade for ore bearing pipes at about 0.7% to 0.8% uranium. This suggests that such pipes may contain mineral bodies of about 14 to 16 pounds or more of uranium per ton. At current prices this is approximately equal to 1 ounce of gold per ton. The pipes contain numerous metals in addition to uranium including copper, silver, vanadium, molybdenum, cobalt and nickel. The uranium mineralization however is by far the most economically important. Mines in this region have produced some 26 million pounds of uranium; some of these known ore bodies have contained as much as 55% uranium (1100 pounds per ton) in some samples. Exploration at North Pipes is for high-grade uranium ore bodies that can be mined economically by underground methods. This area can be explored during the winter months by the Liberty Star exploration team.  Schematic cross section of a solution-collapse breccia pipe, showing the general distribution of uranium ore within the pipe. Nearly all primary ore confined to the breccia pipe: rarely, a little uranium ore is reported in relatively undisturbed beds outside the ring structure. Vertically, most primary ore is below the Coconino Sandstone and at the level of the Hermit Shale and the Esplanade Sandstone of the Supai Group.

Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. (OTCBB: LBSR): Gold Anomaly, Phase 1 for High Grade Metals & Other Prospects



By Dr. Allen Alper, PhD Economic Geology and Petrology, Columbia University, NYC, USA

on 8/13/2016


Liberty Star Uranium & Metals (OTCBB: LBSR) is an exploration and mining development company located in Tucson, Arizona under the leadership of James A. Briscoe. The company's flagship project is Hay Mountain multi-target, multi-metal project located in Cochise County, southeast Arizona. It is a variable depth exploration project for porphyry copper, gold, moly and multiple potential by-product metals including lead, zinc, manganese, silver, uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements. Using the most advanced technology and equipment the company identified the potential for discovery of a high grade and very large limestone replacement and porphyry hosted copper, gold, and moly ore body and plans to engage in exploratory diamond core drilling as soon as possible.





Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. trades as LBSR on the OTCBB.


Liberty Star is an exploration and mining development company located in Tucson, Arizona under the leadership of James A. Briscoe, a Registered Professional Geologist, CA & AZ, with decades of experience exploring and discovering mineral and ore bodies in Alaska, Arizona and California. Mr. Briscoe is a porphyry copper deposits expert and has worked closely with Liberty Star board director Dr. John Guilbert for over 50 years. Dr. Guilbert is the co-developer of the Lowell – Guilbert porphyry copper model, which remains the widely acknowledged standard model describing the structure and shape of mineralization and alteration of porphyry coppers. Mr. Briscoe has also worked with other noted ore finders, ASARCO’s (American Smelting and Refining) Chief Geologist Kenyon E. Richard and James Harold Courtright (Mining Hall of Fame members), as well as prolific porphyry copper ore finder J. David Lowell of the Lowell-Guilbert porphyry copper model. 

The Company’s premier property, the Hay Mountain Project, is located in Cochise County, southeast Arizona. It is an important part of the 42 square mile Tombstone Super Project and Area of Mutual Interest. The Hay Mountain Project is a multi-target, multi-metal, variable depth exploration project for porphyry copper, gold, moly and multiple potential by product metals including lead, zinc, manganese, silver, uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements. Surface studies including “Boots on the Ground” (BOTG) geologic mapping and interpretation, geochemistry (rock, soil & vegetation), geophysics of two advanced types air-born digital magnetics, ZTEM electromagnetics, and x-ray fluorescence analysis using the currently most advanced equipment. The interpretation of all this information and comparison with numerous existing adjacent ore bodies, and other ore bodies known on a worldwide basis, indicate the potential for discovery of a high grade and very large limestone replacement and porphyry hosted copper, gold, and moly ore body. It is of the same type as the nearby Bisbee deposit and other commercially important ore bodies throughout southeast Arizona and elsewhere. Liberty Star plans to engage in exploratory diamond core drilling as soon as possible.

The rising price of gold is making news again in a big way; tell us a little about gold mining in your part of the State (southeast Arizona).  Jim: Our Hay Mountain Project is situated in a larger zone of copper and gold mining extending from northcentral Arizona, east into southwest New Mexico and south into northern Mexico. The US Geological Survey has recently characterized the area as the “Great Cluster” of Copper Resources. However, the geology of the Great Cluster includes gold among other metals. We have always characterized Hay Mountain and the Tombstone Super Project as exploration properties primarily for copper, gold, silver and moly. Thus, we have renamed the USGS area the Great Cluster of Copper and Gold Resources.







The historic Bisbee mining district 15 miles south of Hay Mountain had a healthy gold combined with copper mining enterprise last century. The Copper Queen mine produced nearly 3 million ounces of gold (2,871,786 oz.). Morenci, the Pima Mine and Sierrita mine all report by-product gold from their copper operations. The Johnson Camp mine to the north, as well, is a gold producer. In fact, the Johnson camp started life as a silver and gold operation in the late 1800’s. To the north east of Tucson in the Silver Bell Mountains, where I started working under Kenyon E. Richard and James Harold Courtright, gold was not a major player but has been the subject of continuing exploration. To the south of Bisbee in Sonora Mexico (we are about 20 miles north of the Mexican Border at Hay Mountain) gold mining is very healthy. In fact, Sonora Mexico is the largest gold producing state in Mexico. In 2012, the Mexico Geological Service reported three new important gold deposits in the north west of that state that are being worked on now. 

Therefore, discovery of gold at Hay Mountain would be part of a continuum in the area. You show several maps on your website, libertystaruranium.com with the Hay Mountain gold anomaly. Your geochemical maps are from 2013 and the ZTEM maps are newer.  Tell us how the gold anomaly was discovered. Jim: 1)	Geochem 1972 Roger Newell PhD Dissertation Stanford-only copper, moly zinc, lead and silver.
2)	Geochem 2003-2004 Shea Clark Smith, Metals Exploration Geochemistry, his consulting firm – analysis for more than 50 metallic elements including gold.
3)	Recent Geochem 2011-2014 Rock Chip, Soil and Vegetation –Liberty Star under Clark Smith direction.
4)	ZTEM 2013 with ongoing mapping 2014-2015-simply verifies the center of the ZTEM EM, and MAG anomalies which correspond to the gold-moly-copper anomaly thus defining the porphyry copper system.
5)	Recent Niton work Fall-2015, identifies copper oxide, coming from chalcopyrite sulfide mineralization within one to two inches of the surface within and near the central zone of the porphyry system as defined by the above work totaling a two-mile stretch where there is outcrop, and approximately 1,800 analyses for 53 elements. The methodology cannot penetrate through soil or alluvial cover.  I thus conclude that in fact the defined mineral body is coming to the surface in this area.
a.	We conclude this may be a more shallow occurrence than we had previously concluded, but one that appears to go perhaps to 6,000 feet to the top of old (Precambrian) crystalline metamorphic rocks. The deep anomalies are derived from data gathered by the ZTEM magnetic and electromagnetic helicopter borne surveys.
b.	Near surface gold and/or copper oxide: deposits may be present below thin alluvium and may be minable and leached by solvent extraction resulting in early production while developing the potentially giant porphyry at greater depth.  We are permitting a small trench approximately 15 feet deep by 50 feet long in the area of the indicated gold center as an initial test of this possibility of reaching bedrock and of course, our Phase 1 drilling will test this possibility.
What the geoscientific work tells us: We are dealing with a porphyry system like numerous others in the USGS “Great Cluster,” but very much larger than most or all. Driving this porphyry system is a large intrusive known as a pluton or batholith of granitic composition. This mass was once molten but now a solidified mass. We identified this particular pluton by the obvious signature indicated during airborne magnetometer surveys about 40 years ago and recent ZTEM analysis, which includes digital three-dimensional magnetometry. This one is approximately 40 square miles. We have slides showing the ZTEM   data on our website. We know it is in the copper age range of this area of about 63 million years old. The geochemical anomaly is centered on the pluton, again typical of copper porphyry deposits in the area, and throughout the world. 


Now you need to find if this anomaly is something more in terms of making a discovery and finding out if it is viable. Will you be able to do that during Phase 1 drilling?Jim: Yes, we have designed the test to do so. Phase 1 of the drilling plan (totaling approximately 20 thousand feet) at Hay Mountain, is structured in such a way that we will be able to make some accurate measurements about the presence of copper, gold and moly and other metals (assaying for 50+ elements) at various depths and locations.  We are ready to commence Phase 1 in terms of having targets picked out and having our paperwork in order. The map shows the proposed drill holes as stars on the anomaly map and a map of the geophysical profiles (cross sections) with the projected holes superimposed on them along with the geochemistry. After completion of the drilling, we will know the direction to take the program. We should see a near surface presence that will increase with the intersection of more favorable host sediments, we know are below; as are known in great detail at Bisbee and other porphyry copper deposits in the “Great Cluster.” The test holes are permitted to a depth of 2,000 feet, but greater depth may be required, or conversely we may drill more shallow holes in selected areas or a combination of depths.  We anticipate beginning to define both a large open pit ore body and possibly one or more deep underground minable ore bodies. ZTEM mapping has been very promising in terms of seeing indicators of a deep-seated mineral presence. We conclude gold will be a part of the picture as it has so frequently been throughout the “Great Cluster” area.

Let’s talk about grades. You indicate you are thinking you will see sufficiently high grades for a near surface program for copper and byproduct gold, moly and maybe other metals. How did you come to that conclusion?1.	Other projects in the region. Specifically, the nearby Bisbee District reported copper values of from 5% to 30% copper replacement bodies in limestone when it was first opened, as reported by Dr. F. L. Ransome in 1905 in his USGS Professional Paper on the Bisbee mining district. 
2.	XRF (X –Ray fluorescence) analysis of the gossan copper veinlets at Hay Mountain are in this range and look like outcrops at the entrance to the Copper Queen- Copper Prince mines, at Bisbee.  Similar grades in altered and replaced limestones are common throughout Arizona.
Liberty Star has other Arizona projects and you have mentioned uranium and gold properties elsewhere in the southwest on the Liberty Star website. Can we have a quick summary?1.	The East Silver Bell Porphyry Copper Project (ESB) is located in Pima County, northwest of Tucson, Arizona within the Silver Bell Mining District. Asarco Mining operates three open-pit mines and a solvent extraction plant (SXEW) about 4 ½ miles west of the ESB property. The Company maintains claims covering a previously unrecognized porphyry copper center, which has been identified by drilling and shows chalcocite enrichment mineralization like that of the Oxide, El Tiro, and North Silver Bell mines operated by ASARCO . The claims currently are within the Ironwood Forest National Monument, established after the claims were staked and have been maintained each year.  We are in ongoing low-level conversations regarding this mineral body.
2.	The exploration-stage North Pipes Super Project is located in Mohave County, northwest Arizona near the Utah border on the Arizona Strip. The Arizona Geological Survey concurs with our extensive work and notes the Arizona Strip is rich in uranium bearing breccia pipes. While uranium is the most commercially important metal, the pipes contain numerous other metals including copper, silver, vanadium, molybdenum, cobalt and nickel. Exploration at North Pipes is for high-grade uranium ore bodies that can be mined economically by underground methods. This may be one of the largest and highest-grade uranium resources in the world.  After a moratorium in mining by the Obama administration, eleven claims have been retained over what geophysically appears to be a very large pipe or perhaps a triple breccia pipe.

3.	While Hay Mountain is our dominant pursuit now, we have two addition property blocks within the Tombstone Super Project.   The Walnut Creek and Tombstone South projects occupy other geologic structures, suggesting porphyry copper and precious metal targets.   Further study and potential drilling programs are recommended for both in professional technical reports issued in 2011.   
4.	 There are as many as seven properties for high-grade gold and silver in Nevada and Arizona that we are looking at, and others in California that we know about. These were producing mines that are dormant and have been since the WW II era Gold Closing Act. These mines closed even as they were producing and still could yield billions in gold and silver, especially given the advances in mining technology. These may be relatively quick- to- production projects. 
5.	The Arizona Strip and the larger Colorado Plateau host high-grade uranium deposits. Our North Pipes are in northwest Arizona and across the border in southwest Utah are numerous shallow uranium targets. We are working with a venture partner possibly to develop a low cost quick turnaround program. Utah is a mining friendly state where this type of program could work.  
6.	Lithium – currently the “flavor of the day” metal exploration primarily due to Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors and recently combined SolarCity, which uses a newly designed lithium-ion battery.  This appears to be groundbreaking technology, and a giant plant is under construction north of Reno, Nevada with Phase 1 of 6 reportedly at completion and battery manufacture underway.  We hope this progress continues, and is ultimately successful, as it will be game changing for the USA and the world.  Now the whole lithium mine production paradigm seems to be hanging on this success.  There are several other battery designs using other metals such as vanadium and others.  We have target areas for brine based lithium occurrence but we want to bide our time on this rush.




When we talk about the Tesla cars, other vehicles, competitive brands, and solar electric generation, one thing is certain.  They will all use amazing amounts of copper, particularly the high performance cars, as Tesla’s models, to move high horse power electricity from the batteries to the powerful electric motors that drive the wheels that drive the vehicles.  We will be very happy to supply the copper and ancillary metals that will be necessary to drive these high performance vehicles.  As these vehicles replace gasoline and diesel engines, we can be sure the price of copper will move upward to supply the vast needs of this previously unpredicted new type of vehicle, and new use of copper.



Thank you. That sounds very promising.
