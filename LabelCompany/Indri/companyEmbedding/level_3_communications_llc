Life at Level 3
Many companies say they have the ability to change the world. At Level 3 Communications, we mean it. Connectivity is revolutionizing the world, and Level 3 is at the forefront.




Diversity and Inclusion

Welcome from the CEO


My sincerest thanks for considering a career at Level 3 Communications. I’d like to tell you why I think it’s one of the best decisions you could ever make.

As a premier global communications provider and operator of a 200,000-mile fiber network, Level 3 has authored many exciting chapters in the history of communications technology – and we’re poised to write many more. Connectivity has become an indispensable commodity for modern living, and we are in the vanguard of not only interconnecting more and more of our world but also creating solutions that shape how that world lives, learns and works.
Despite its relative infancy, modern communication is already as ingrained in everyday life as running water. It’s a field that can uniquely offer the dynamism of young, disruptive technology, but at the global scale of, say, electricity or cars. What this all means is that at Level 3, you have the uncommon opportunity to sculpt your career, our company and the very evolution of an industry that touches the entire human population.
Level 3 is powered by a global team of more than 13,000 of the brightest minds and biggest imaginations on the planet. We are looking for employees across all areas of expertise to help us build tomorrow’s technology. We commit to providing you with a great work environment, opportunities for career growth and the chance to be part of something extraordinary.
I’ll leave you with our employee value proposition – a promise for which I hold myself personally responsible:
Our winning team is the essence of today and tomorrow’s communications. At Level 3, people combine challenging work with ingenuity to help each other thrive in our global, fast-paced and growing company. We believe that speaking the truth, doing what we say we are going to do and having passion for delivering an exceptional customer experience drives our success. Level 3 makes global communications possible; together with our customers, we are changing the world. Come grow with us and be part of something that’s important and exciting.
We are changing the world for the better. I hope you’ll come change it with us.
— Jeff Storey, Level 3 Chief Executive Officer

Level 3® DDoS Mitigation
Stay Up and Running. No Matter What.
Downtime is no longer an inconvenience. It can do serious harm to your brand, your productivity and your bottom line. Every minute your network is down is a minute you can’t connect with colleagues, customers or partners.
That’s why distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks must be prevented. And Level 3 Communications can help.
With Level 3 DDoS Mitigation, we provide network-based, "always-on" and on-demand protection with 24 x 7 monitoring.

DDoS Mitigation - Proxy OverviewDDoS Mitigation Overview



 


Why Level 3 DDoS Mitigation Services Scrubbing center mitigation techniques alone are not designed to manage today’s highly sophisticated and distributed attacks. You need to deploy a multi-layered security approach backed by extensive threat research to defend against a variety of attack types.
Only network-based DDoS mitigation solutions can provide realistic protection to enterprise resources. Let Level 3 help you quickly identify and mitigate the latest threats, so you stay connected – no matter what.


*Under Attack?

July 17, 2017
HBO Streams 'Game of Thrones' Season 7 Using Level 3's CDN
HBO GO Customers Have Access to GOT Anytime, Anywhere

BROOMFIELD, Colo., July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- There is more than one way to watch HBO's blockbuster Game of Thrones (GOT), which premiered its seventh season on July 16. The premium programming provider continues to rely on Level 3 Communications (NYSE: LVLT) to deliver the show to millions of viewers over its global content delivery network (CDN). As a preferred partner of HBO, Level 3 enables the HBO GO platform's streaming of the show, providing subscribers with the ability to watch GOT on their mobile device, tablet, laptop, gaming console or smart TV. 
Key Facts:  

HBO GO is available to customers who subscribe to HBO through a TV cable, satellite or telco provider, and provides access to HBO original series and countless hit movies.
HBO leverages Level 3's global CDN capabilities to support its HBO GO platform delivery initiatives; Level 3 has provided CDN solutions to HBO for its HBO GO platform since 2011.
In 2016, Level 3's CDN delivered 15 exabytes of data and answered 33.4 trillion requests for content like videos or photos.
Level 3's CDN comprises more than 15,000 servers distributed across 6 continents in more than 100 major cities - all connected to the Level 3 network. In addition, the CDN offers 22 terabits of CDN egress capacity and provides up to 60 petabytes of storage (one petabyte of data is equivalent to 13.3 years of high-definition video).
Key Quotes:Diane Tryneski, Chief Digital Officer, HBO"HBO viewers expect a high-quality, seamless viewing experience across all of our platforms, regardless of device or location. Level 3 has been pivotal in our ability to stream Game of Thrones and other HBO programming to our customers, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with them, particularly for the highly anticipated new season of Game of Thrones."
Laurinda Pang, Regional President, North America and Asia Pacific, Level 3"With increasingly higher bitrates, and more viewers and devices accessing HBO GO content, the importance of relying on a network optimized for media delivery cannot be overstated. Game of Thrones is one of the most popular shows in the world, and HBO's use of Level 3's CDN for the HBO GO platform will enable millions of people to enjoy the show anytime, anywhere, on any device."

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

Transaction Valued at Approximately $34 Billion
Expect to Achieve $975 Million in Annual Run-Rate Cash Synergies that will Enhance Ability to Invest in Advanced Networks
Transaction Expected to be Accretive to Free Cash Flow in First Year Following Close and Significantly Accretive on an Annual Run-Rate Basis
Expect to Maintain CenturyLink's Annual Dividend of $2.16 Per Share
Companies to Host Conference Call Today at 8:00 A.M. ET





MONROE, La. and BROOMFIELD, Colo., Oct, 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL) and Level 3 Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LVLT) today announced that their Boards of Directors have unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $34 billion, including the assumption of debt. Under terms of the agreement, Level 3 shareholders will receive $26.50 per share in cash and a fixed exchange ratio of 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink stock for each Level 3 share they own, which implies a purchase price of $66.50 per Level 3 share (based on a CenturyLink $28.00 per share reference price) and a premium of approximately 42 percent based on Level 3's unaffected closing share price of $46.92 on October 26, 2016, the last trading day prior to market speculation about a potential transaction. Upon the closing of the transaction, CenturyLink shareholders will own approximately 51 percent and Level 3 shareholders will own approximately 49 percent of the combined company.
The combined company will have the ability to offer CenturyLink's larger enterprise customer base the benefits of Level 3's global footprint with a combined presence in more than 60 countries. In addition, the combined company will be positioned to further invest in the reach and speeds of its broadband infrastructure for small businesses and consumers.
"The digital economy relies on broadband connectivity, and together with Level 3 we will have one of the most robust fiber network and high-speed data services companies in the world," said Glen Post, CenturyLink Chief Executive Officer and President. "This transaction furthers our commitment to providing our customers with the network to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses. It is this focus on providing fiber connectivity that will continue to distinguish CenturyLink from our competitors. CenturyLink shareholders will benefit from the significant synergies and financial flexibility provided by the combined company's revenue growth and strong cash flow. For employees, this combination will bring together two highly customer-focused organizations and provide employees growth and advancement opportunities the companies could not offer separately." 
"This is a compelling transaction for our customers, shareholders and employees," said Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Level 3. "In addition to the substantial value delivered to shareholders, the combined company will be uniquely positioned to meet the evolving and global needs of enterprise customers."
Strategic and Financial Benefits


Highly Complementary Businesses with Expanded Fiber Networks: This transaction increases CenturyLink's network by 200,000 route miles of fiber, which includes 64,000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33,000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents. Accounting for those served by both companies, CenturyLink's on-net buildings are expected to increase by nearly 75 percent to approximately 75,000, including 10,000 buildings in EMEA and Latin America. Overall, the complementary domestic and international networks will provide cost efficiencies by focusing capital investment on increasing capacity and extending the reach of the combined company's high-bandwidth fiber network.


Enhanced Competitive Offerings in Business Network Services: The combined company will have significantly improved network capabilities, creating a world-class enterprise player with approximately $19 billion in pro forma business revenue and$13 billion in business strategic revenue, for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2016. Together, CenturyLink's and Level 3's revenue will be 76 percent derived from business customers, and 65 percent of the combined company's core revenue will be from strategic services. Given the complementary nature of the portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet customers' demand for more bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.


Enhanced Broadband Infrastructure: This transaction will provide the combined company with increased opportunity to invest in its broadband infrastructure and enhance broadband speed for small businesses and consumers.


Strong Financial Profile: The combined company is expected to have improved adjusted EBITDA margins, revenue growth and pro forma net leverage of less than 3.7x at close, including run-rate synergies. The combined company will benefit from Level 3's nearly $10 billion of net operating losses ("NOLs"). These NOLs will substantially reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense over the next several years, positioning it to generate substantial free cash flow.


Improved Dividend Coverage: The improved free cash flow will enhance the combined company's financial flexibility and significantly lower its payout ratio. CenturyLink expects to maintain its annual dividend of $2.16 per share.


Significantly Accretive to Free Cash Flow with Multiple Opportunities for Growth: CenturyLink expects the transaction to be accretive to free cash flow in the first full year following the close of the transaction and significantly accretive on an annual run-rate basis thereafter. Furthermore, the transaction will be accretive to CenturyLink's existing growth profile with additional upside opportunities, including the ability to deploy CenturyLink's and Level 3's product portfolio across the combined customer bases. With increased network scale, and dense local metro areas and global reach, the combined company will be positioned to further expand internationally.


Substantial Run-Rate Synergies: Both companies have a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. The increased scale afforded by the combined company is expected to generate $975 million of annual run-rate cash synergies, primarily from the elimination of duplicative functions, systems consolidation, and increased operational and capital efficiencies.


Management, Board and Location
After the close of the transaction, Glen Post will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President and Sunit Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Level 3, will serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.
The Chairman of CenturyLink's Board at the time of the closing of the transaction will continue to serve as Chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint four Level 3 Board members at closing, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing (a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Telemedia).
The combined company will be headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana and will maintain a significant presence in Colorado and the Denver metropolitan area.
Financing and Approvals
CenturyLink intends to finance the cash portion of the transaction and pay related fees and expenses through a combination of cash on hand at CenturyLink and Level 3, and approximately $7 billion of additional indebtedness. In connection therewith, CenturyLink has received financing commitments from BofA Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC totaling approximately $10.2 billion for new secured debt facilities, comprised of a new $2 billion secured revolving credit facility and approximately $8.2 billion of other secured debt facilities, including the refinancing of indebtedness expected to mature prior to closing of the transaction. All existing indebtedness of Level 3 is expected to remain in place at Level 3 and Level 3 will not incur any incremental indebtedness or guarantee any indebtedness of CenturyLink to finance the transaction.
The companies anticipate closing the transaction by the end of third quarter 2017. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, review by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, certain state regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is also subject to the approval of CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders.
CenturyLink has entered into a voting agreement with STT Crossing (a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Telemedia), holder of approximately 18 percent of Level 3's outstanding common stock, pursuant to which it will vote its Level 3 shares in favor of the transaction.
CenturyLink and Level 3 Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results

In light of today's transaction and third quarter earnings announcements, CenturyLink and Level 3 have both cancelled their previously announced calls for Wednesday, November 2, 2016 and Thursday, November 3, 2016, respectively.

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced an agreement to acquire Level 3 Communications in a cash and stock transaction.[6]

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

It operates a Tier 1 network.[4] The company provides core transport, IP, voice, video, and content delivery for medium-to-large Internet carriers in North America, Latin America, Europe, and selected cities in Asia.[5] Level 3 is also the largest competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and the 3rd largest provider of fiber-optic internet access (based on coverage) in the United States.
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced an agreement to acquire Level 3 Communications in a cash and stock transaction.[6]

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
