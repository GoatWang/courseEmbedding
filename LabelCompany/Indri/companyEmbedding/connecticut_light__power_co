History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.
In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]
In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.[13]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]
Transmission controversy[edit]
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015,[30] the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”.[31] Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state[32]
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging It to deny Eversource’s proposed $300 Million rate increase. In her testimony[33], she challenged the need for Eversource’s rate increase, noting NSTAR’s and WMECo’s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR’s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.
Major projects[edit]
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it.

Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units.

Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]

History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.
In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]
In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.[13]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]
Transmission controversy[edit]
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015,[30] the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”.[31] Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state[32]
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging It to deny Eversource’s proposed $300 Million rate increase. In her testimony[33], she challenged the need for Eversource’s rate increase, noting NSTAR’s and WMECo’s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR’s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.
Major projects[edit]
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation.

In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]

In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]

Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.
In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]
In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.[13]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]
Transmission controversy[edit]
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015,[30] the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”.[31] Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state[32]
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging It to deny Eversource’s proposed $300 Million rate increase. In her testimony[33], she challenged the need for Eversource’s rate increase, noting NSTAR’s and WMECo’s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR’s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.
Major projects[edit]
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

Connecticut Light and Power Company

Connecticut Light and Power Company History
Connecticut Light and Power Company is Connecticut’s largest utility. The company brings power to 1.2 million customers in 149 cities and towns – covering some 4,400 square miles with more than 22,000 miles of power lines. 
The company was the creation of J. Henry Roraback, a lawyer and powerful Republican who dominated Connecticut state politics in the early 20th century. In 1905, Roraback – described in accounts as a “big, forceful, mustachioed man” – used his political muscle to lobby the state legislature, convincing them to pass a special act that gave him sole power rights to the Rocky River, a tributary of the Housatonic. Four years later, the legislature gave Roraback permission to build dams and mills and sell his water-generated power wholesale throughout the state.  The resulting company – then known as the Rocky River Power Company – would eventually supply power to the entire state of Connecticut. The company changed its name to Connecticut Light and Power Company in 1917 and bought three nearby power companies – the start of a long history of acquisitions. 
CL&P continued to grow and thrive over the next several decades; today, it is made up of more than 60 formerly operating companies. Since 1966, CL&P has been a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, a utility holding company consisting of four New England energy companies. Today, Northeast Utilities is a publicly traded, Fortune 500 company that provides power to 2.1 million customers. It is headquartered in Berlin, Connecticut.
Asbestos Exposure Risk at Connecticut Light & Power 
Extreme heat is a constant challenge at power plants. The nature of the work that boilers, generator and turbines perform put them – and workers – at constant risk of fire and heat damage. To prevent this, power plant equipment prior to the 1970s was frequently made with a naturally occurring mineral found to have powerful fireproofing qualities. 
That naturally occurring mineral was asbestos, a substance that until recent decades was widely used in thousands of products as a fire-retardant and strengthening agent. It was highly effective, and because it is found in large mineral deposits in nature, it was also cheap and easy to obtain. In power plants, asbestos was used for multiple purposes: to seal gaskets, insulate pipes, and as a covering on power lines and cables. Power plants also used asbestos in their roofs and floors to make the buildings themselves resistant to fire. Even paint and plumbing equipment contained asbestos.
Today, we know there are serious health risks associated with asbestos, and exposure to the substance can be deadly. When insulation or other products containing asbestos deteriorate, or when they are torn or cut, asbestos fibers are released into the air and, if inhaled, can become lodged in a person’s lung tissue. This can lead to serious respiratory diseases like mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis.
Power plants stopped putting asbestos in their equipment in the 1970s, but by then, thousands of unsuspecting workers had already been put at risk. Furthermore, while power plants no longer use asbestos in their equipment, the substance may still exist in some older buildings and machines. Therefore, it’s important that workers exercise caution and use protective gear in situations when they may come into contact with asbestos fibers.
Occupations at Risk for Asbestos Exposure
Anyone who worked at a Connecticut Light and Power Company power plant – especially prior to the 1970s, though some exposure may have occurred more recently – may have been exposed to hazardous asbestos fibers. Power plant workers sometimes needed to cut and sand gaskets that contained asbestos, or cut down pieces of asbestos-containing insulation. These actions released asbestos fibers into the air, and – without proper respiratory equipment – those fibers were easily inhaled. Not only was power plant equipment made with asbestos, but the buildings themselves often contained the mineral as well. As the floors and ceilings were worked on, asbestos dust was often spread throughout the powerhouse, putting all workers in the vicinity at risk.
Family members of power plant workers could have been affected by asbestos as well, even if they never entered the power plant. Because asbestos fibers cling to clothing, anyone who washed or handled a worker’s dusty work clothes could have inhaled the dangerous fibers.
It can take decades for symptoms of mesothelioma cancer to begin to appear – sometimes as long as 50 years. This means that, sadly, survival rates for the disease are very low. If you or someone you love may have been exposed to harmful asbestos in the workplace, take the time to learn more about the risk factors and treatment of the disease.

Asbestos Exposure









Many American workers, across a variety of industries, were exposed to asbestos on the job. As a result, they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma.
In this section, learn about the history of asbestos use, about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them.  Find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure.  Learn which job sites across the United States were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos.
What is Asbestos?

Long considered a miracle material, asbestos boasts excellent fire- and heat- resistant properties. This naturally-occurring mineral, now known to be a human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), has a history that dates back to ancient Greece. Asbestos was used as a building material, even as far back as during the Roman Empire. Asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles.
During the Industrial Revolution, asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the United States. Asbestos was used not only in factories, but also in oil refineries, chemical plants, on railroad cars, and in shipyards. Asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives, to line tanks and ovens in refineries, and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships, from engine rooms to galleys. As the twentieth century progressed, more uses for asbestos were found. It was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles, insulated America’s new skyscrapers, and was used extensively in the construction industry, where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds, cements, roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, siding, stucco, plaster, and much more. Those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestos-heavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products.
By the middle of the twentieth century, it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems. Asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma. This asbestos-related cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium. This thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity. Asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface. This scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop.
Despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos, historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous, yet continued to allow its use. Over time, as stories of sick employees became commonplace, the American government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos.

Asbestos Exposure in the United States

Exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites, in shipyards, aboard navy vessels, and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings. People working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk. In addition, teachers, students, and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products, such as ceiling or floor tiles. Equally at risk are families of these workers, as asbestos often was carried home on clothing.

If you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used, you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma.

Different Types of Asbestos Exposure

Military Exposure
Asbestos was used across all branches of the military for  many years. Navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving  on ships (aircraft  carriers, destroyers, submarines, battleships, warships,  etc.) in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country. Army  veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and  while working on military vehicles. Air Force veterans were exposed while  working with military aircraft. Marine Corps veterans that spent time at sea  aboard Navy ships were exposed to asbestos. All veterans exposed to asbestos  have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial and Industrial Exposure
Many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and  commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer.  The types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries, power  plants, steel  mills and chemical plants to name a few. They all have “high heat”  environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required,  be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective  clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas (i.e.  fire-proof gloves and aprons). Today, even though the use of asbestos has been  banned in the United States, many existing industrial and commercial structures  may still contain a certain level of asbestos. It is important that appropriate  safety precautions be taken, where necessary, to prevent harmful exposure and  to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial Product Exposure
Do-it-yourself home renovation enthusiasts, as well as those  who worked in the construction trade, may have been exposed to asbestos while  working with popular building and construction products. Many of these products  were made with asbestos through the late 1970’s as the projects they were to be  used in required that they be heat and fire resistant. They included insulation,  roofing material, siding, joint  compound, ceiling tiles, flooring and more. Unfortunately when any of these  products were cut, sawed filed, or sanded, asbestos fibers were released into  the air. In the majority of cases, those working with the products did not use  appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information  about the health hazards of asbestos for many years. Today, as a result,  construction workers and do-it-yourselfers are at risk for developing  mesothelioma or other asbestos-related  diseases.
Second Hand Exposure
Direct, on-the-job asbestos exposure did not affect American  workers alone. Their family members were also at risk of developing an  asbestos-related disease as a result of second  hand asbestos exposure. This type of exposure occurred when workers brought  asbestos fibers home on their hair, clothing or shoes at the end of the work  day. Those responsible for laundering their work clothes, day in and day out,  were most commonly affected, but even small children who spent time with their parent  before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at  risk of developing an asbestos-related illness.
Talc Exposure
Talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries. Talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe, but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits. Due to this, some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos. While talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure, some consumer products, namely baby powder and, more recently, children’s art supplies, have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users, mostly women, to be exposed to asbestos. Today, products using talc are tested for asbestos, but that was not always the case. Because mesothelioma has a long latency period, miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestos-containing talc products.

Unions Protect Workers from Asbestos Exposure

 Throughout the United States and across the world, hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries, from steel workers to plumbers, to electricians.  Unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job. Unions have organized witnesses for court cases, have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma, and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by mega-companies to compensate asbestos victims.

Compensation for Workers Exposed to Asbestos

If you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure, you may be entitled to compensation.  Each state has its own deadlines, called statutes of limitations, which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits.

Is Electricity a “Product”?


September 3, 2008
admin


  Whether electricity supplied to a homeowner by the local electric utility  is viewed as a “product” or a “service” may have significant ramifications in litigation.  If providing electricity constitutes a “product”, injured plaintiffs can seek recovery under a theory of strict liability.  If it is not a product, the plaintiff would have to demonstrate the electric utility failed to use reasonable care.  In a recent Connecticut case, Travelers Indemnity Company of America v. Connecticut Light & Power Co, Hartford J.D. at Harford (Docket No. CV-07-5012441-S ) 2008 WL 2447351 (Conn. Super.), the trial court  held that once electricity entered the homeowner’s residence, it constituted a “product” rather than a “service” and that plaintiff could  proceed under the Connecticut Product Liability Act (“CPLA”).   In the case, a fire allegedly caused by voltage fluctuations broke out in the home of Travelers’ insureds, Linda and Michael Murphy, resulting in property damage.  Apparently,  the Murphy’s had complained to CL&P earlier about the voltage fluctuations and had been assured that the problem had been addressed.  After paying the claim,
Connecticut courts are split concerning whether electricity can be classified as a product such that a claim could be brought under the CPLA..  However, the court in Travelers relied upon what appears to be an emerging majority view nationally.  In a 1985 California appellate decision, Pierce v. PG&E, the court opined that policy justifications warranted the imposition of strict liability: (1)  difficulty of proving negligence involving a vast and complex electrical power system; (2) economic incentive for improved product safety; (3) to encourage reallocation of resources toward safer products; and (4) to spread the risk of loss among all who use the product.  What judicial limitations may be reasonable to prevent increased access to strict liability in tort for toxic tort plaintiffs injured by electricity? One bright line test might be permit electricity to be viewed as a product only when the electricity has been transferred to the consumer in a usable voltage.  Only then could a court reasonably view electricity as a consumer product.  Under this test, exposure to high voltage transmission lines would not result in a strict liability lawsuit.

180 Conn. 230 (1980)
JOSEPHINE GIGLIO ET AL.
v.
CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY
Supreme Court of Connecticut.
Argued November 15, 1979.
Decision released April 15, 1980.
COTTER, C. J., LOISELLE, BOGDANSKI, PETERS and WRIGHT, JS.
*231 William B. Fitzgerald, Jr., with whom were John C. Bullock and, on the brief, Anthony M. Fitzgerald, for the appellant (defendant).
Thomas L. Brayton, for the appellee (named plaintiff).
WRIGHT, J.
In October of 1959, the defendant Connecticut Light and Power Company converted a coal burning home furnace to gas operation for the named plaintiff Josephine Giglio (hereinafter the plaintiff) in her apartment in Waterbury. On October 7, 1967, the plaintiff's daughter, feeling cold, raised the thermostat regulating the furnace. When the furnace did not start, she checked the system's "Baso Safety Switch," an indicator designed to tell whether the pilot light was on or off. If the pilot light were on, the color silver should have appeared in the window with the word "on" displayed. If the pilot light were off, the word *232 "off" and the color red should have appeared. The indicator on the plaintiff's Baso safety switch always showed partially silver and partially red, thereby confusing the plaintiff.
On numerous occasions prior to the incident in question, the plaintiff Josephine Giglio had informed Connecticut Light and Power Company employees of the condition of the indicator. On those occasions the defendant's employees told the plaintiff to check to see if the pilot light was lit. In order to check to see if the pilot light was on, the plaintiff necessarily had to open the furnace door.
On this particular occasion, the plaintiff's daughter opened the furnace door and observed that the pilot light was on, but at the same time the furnace was not running and no heat was being generated. The plaintiff Josephine Giglio then checked the furnace and pilot light herself. When she opened the furnace door, there was a simultaneous "puff" or "roll-out" of flames that shot out and severely burned the plaintiff.
At trial, the plaintiff's claim sounded in counts of negligence and strict liability in tort. The jury returned an identical verdict for the plaintiff Josephine Giglio on both counts.
Where there are two or more counts, a general verdict will be upheld if any of the counts are valid. Franks v. Lockwood, 146 Conn. 273, 279, 150 A.2d 215; Mercier v. Naugatuck Fuel Co., 139 Conn. 521, 525, 95 A.2d 263; Bulkley v. Andrews, 39 Conn. 523, 534. Similarly, where there are two or more distinct causes of action, a general verdict will cure an erroneous charge as to one of them. Barbieri v. Pandiscio, 116 Conn. 48, 53, 163 A. 469.
*233 In view of the foregoing, we are restricting our discussion to the second count of the substitute complaint relating to strict liability in tort. We express no opinion as to the negligence claim.
The defendant has assigned numerous errors. Some of these assignments would be pertinent if the judgment on the first count relating to negligence were to be scrutinized by this court. Since we are restricting our opinion, however, to the second count relating to strict liability in tort, there remain only three main issues to be reviewed.

I
DO THE EVIDENCE AND THE LAW SUPPORT A PLAITIFF'S VERDICT ON THE THEORY OF STRICT TORT LIBILITY?
The issue in this case is whether the defendant Connecticut Light and Power Company's failure adequately to warn the plaintiff of the possibility of a "roll-out" in the event that the furnace door were opened while the pilot light was on but with the furnace not running constituted an unreasonably dangerous condition, thereby rendering the furnace defective. We answer this issue in the affirmative. Under the doctrine of strict liability in tort we find that the jury had sufficient evidence upon which to hold the defendant liable for the damages caused by its defective product.
In Garthwait v. Burgio, 153 Conn. 284, 216 A.2d 189, we accepted the principles adopted by the American Law Institute as contained in § 402A of the Restatement (Second), Torts, establishing strict liability in tort. We have reaffirmed those principles in subsequent cases. Wachtel v. Rosol, 159 *234 Conn. 496, 271 A.2d 84; Rossignol v. Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., 154 Conn. 549, 227 A.2d 418.
In order to recover under the doctrine of strict liability in tort the plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant was engaged in the business of selling the product; (2) the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user; (3) the defect caused the injury for which compensation was sought; (4) the defect existed at the time of the sale; and (5) the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in condition. Restatement (Second), Torts § 402A (1965); see Rossignol v. Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., 154 Conn. 549, 562, 227 A.2d 418.
The parties did not dispute that the defendant was in the business of selling or leasing gas furnaces, nor is it disputed that the gas furnace reached the plaintiff without substantial change in condition. The focus of this case then is whether the furnace was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the plaintiff.
The doctrine of strict liability in tort is concerned with the character of the product injected into the stream of commerce, not with the specific conduct of the defendant. 2 Dooley, Modern Tort Law § 32.35 (1977). The plaintiff must prove that the product is unreasonably dangerous. Comment i of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 402A, defines an "unreasonably dangerous" product as one "dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics." In *235 this regard, it is important to note that it is not necessary that the plaintiff in a strict liability tort action establish a specific defect, so long as there is evidence of some unspecified dangerous condition. See Lindsay v. McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Corporation, 460 F.2d 631, 637 (8th Cir. 1972); 2 Dooley, Modern Tort Law, op. cit., § 32.49; 63 Am. Jur. 2d, Products Liability § 15. Whether a product is unreasonably dangerous is a question of fact to be determined by the jury. As we recently stated, "[t]his includes those questions arising under § 402A, and the jury can draw their own reasonable conclusions as to the expectations of the ordinary consumer and the knowledge common in the community at large." Slepski v. Williams Ford, Inc., 170 Conn. 18, 23, 364 A.2d 175.
It is well established in this jurisdiction; Tomer v. American Home Products Corporation, 170 Conn. 681, 689, 368 A.2d 35; Basko v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 416 F.2d 417 (2d Cir. 1969); as well as in a majority of other jurisdictions; see generally, 2 Dooley, Modern Tort Law, op. cit., § 32.39; that "[a] product may be defective because a manufacturer or seller failed to warn of the product's unreasonably dangerous propensities." See Restatement (Second), Torts § 402A; Prokolkin v. General Motors Corporation, 170 Conn. 289, 365 A.2d 1180; Noel, "Manufacturer's Negligence of Design or Directions for Use of a Product," 71 Yale L.J. 816 (1962); Prosser, "The Fall of the Citadel," 50 Minn. L. Rev. 791, 826 (1965-66).
Dean Prosser, the Restatement (Second) Reporter, states: "There is no dispute that the seller is under a duty to give adequate warning of unreasonable dangers involved in the use of which *236 he knows, or should know. The duty extends not only to dangers arising from improper design or other negligence in manufacturing, but also to dangers inseparable from a properly made product of the particular kind." Prosser, Law of Torts (4th Ed. 1971), pp. 646-47. See Basko v. Sterling Drug, Inc., supra, 426. In other words, the failure to warn in such circumstances is, of itself, a defect. Prosser, op. cit., p. 659.
In the case at hand, the facts clearly show that the defendant knew, or should have known, of the potentiality of a dangerous roll-out occurring. The evidence revealed that the manufacturer anticipated, and that the defendant was aware of, this dangerous possibility.
The safety unit contained no warnings. The only wording on the unit constituted instructions, intended for a service person, and for the consumer, on how to start the pilot light in the event it went out.[1] Moreover, these instructions were applicable only where the pilot light was out. There were no instructions or warning on what to do, or what not to do, when the pilot light was on, but the furnace was not running and no heat was being generated, as was the situation in this case. In any event, the duty to warn involves more than instructions intended for service personnel. The warning must consider the consumer's comprehension. Technical language or instructions are insufficient. Similarly, language directed to persons who could not reasonably *237 be expected to understand the nomenclature is insufficient. West v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co., 197 N.W.2d 202 (Iowa 1972); 2 Dooley, Modern Tort Law, op. cit., § 32.39. Warnings must specifically identify for the user the danger inherent in the product's use.
Moreover, on several occasions the plaintiff notified the defendant's employees that the safety unit on the furnace did not clearly indicate whether the pilot light was on. The defendant's employees' instructions to the plaintiff to open the furnace door to see if the pilot light was on in no way resembles a warning. As stated above, the defendant knew the capabilities of the furnace to accumulate unburned fuel which could result in a dangerous roll-out. The defendant had a duty adequately to warn the plaintiff of this unreasonably dangerous condition.
The failure to place an adequate warning on the furnace's safety unit, as well as the failure verbally to warn the plaintiff of the possibility of a roll-out, amount to a defect in the furnace giving rise to an unreasonably dangerous condition. Upon the evidence presented, the jury could properly conclude that the defendant was strictly liable in tort for the injuries resulting therefrom.

II

DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ALLOWING AN AMENMENT TO ADD ALLEGATIONS OF DEFECTS IN THE PRODUCT?
As previously stated, the accident occurred on October 2, 1967. Original counsel brought suit on September 30, 1968. On August 6, 1974, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their substitute complaint to allege that the defendant permitted certain *238 defects to remain in the furnace system. The amendment was allowed by the trial court. In this appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred in allowing such an amendment more than seven years after the accident occurred.
The defendant makes no claim that the amendment resulted in a delay or surprise. The trial took place in December, 1976. In the intervening two and one-third years from the date of the amendment, the defendant conducted a number of experiments and tests on various parts of the furnace system. In view of the fact that the court has broad discretion on the allowing of amendments, we must examine the pleadings to determine whether the amendment injected a completely new cause of action.
An examination of the third count of the original complaint reveals the following paragraphs:
"5. Said purported safety unit was sold to plaintiff Josephine Giglio in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to plaintiff Josephine Giglio and reach [sic] the plaintiff Josephine Giglio without substantial change in condition in which it was sold.
"6. On or about October 7, 1967, as a result of the continuing tortuous [sic] conduct of defendant The Connecticut Light & Power Company, gas in said furnace exploded and shot flames on the plaintiff Josephine Giglio and caused her the hereinafter stated severe burns and injuries.
"7. The tortuous [sic] conduct of defendant The Connecticut Light & Power Company continued from the time of said sale of the purported safety unit until October 7, 1967 because the defendant The Connecticut Light & Power Company continually *239 permitted said purported safety unit to be available for use although they knew or should have known that said purported safety unit was defective and inherently dangerous and a continuing source of unreasonable risk of injury to plaintiff Josephine Giglio and they failed to indicate and warn plaintiff Josephine Giglio by label or otherwise of the dangers she was exposed to."
In Gallo v. G. Fox & Co., 148 Conn. 327, 330, 170 A.2d 724, we stated:
"A cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief. Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. v. Pearson, 139 Conn. 186, 197, 91 A.2d 778; Veits v. Hartford, 134 Conn. 428, 434, 58 A.2d 389. `A right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action.' Pavelka v. St. Albert Society, 82 Conn. 146, 147, 72 A. 725.... It is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action, provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same."
As to relation back of amendments, we said in Keenan v. Yale New Haven Hospital, 167 Conn. 284, 285, 355 A.2d 253, that "[a]mendments relate back to the date of the complaint unless they allege a new cause of action."
This doctrine is akin to rule 15 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides in pertinent part: "(c) RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS. *240 Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading."
Pursuant to this rule the court in Hockett v. American Airlines, Inc., 357 F. Sup. 1343 (N.D. Ill. 1973), found that an amendment to add a spouse to allege a claim for loss of consortium related back. That court summarized (pp. 1347-48) the law as follows:
"Rule 15 (c) is based upon the concept that a party who is notified of litigation concerning a given transaction or occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitation are intended to afford, 3 Moore's Federal Practice para. 15.15 [3]. The objective of state statutes of limitations, to protect persons from the necessity of defending stale claims, is served under Rule 15 (c), since the amendment will not relate back unless the original pleading has given fair notice to the adverse party that a claim is being asserted against him from some particular transaction or occurrence, Wright, Law of Federal Courts, p. 276 (2d ed. 1970)."
In reviewing the pertinent law and the allegations of the original complaint, we find in the instant case that the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the amendment specifying defects in the furnace equipment.

III
IS THE CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFF JOSEPHINE GIGLIO BARRED BY THE APPROPRIATE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS?
The claim in this case is based on a continuing course of conduct. The converting of the furnace *241 was done on October 12, 1959, but on several occasions after 1959, the plaintiff Josephine Giglio notified the defendant of difficulties with the furnace, and the defendant on those occasions gave the plaintiff various instructions. It was for the jury to say whether such instructions were adequate.
In Handler v. Remington Arms Co., 144 Conn. 316, 321, 130 A.2d 793, we said: "When the wrong sued upon consists of a continuing course of conduct, the statute does not begin to run until that course of conduct is completed. Vilcinskas v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 144 Conn. 170, 174, 127 A.2d 814." In that case the court held that the sale of a defective cartridge, without indicating the danger on the label, was a continuing omission of a duty to the prospective user of the cartridge.
As the present suit was pending on June 4, 1976, it comes within the purview of § 52-577a[2] of the General Statutes, which provides that no strict tort liability action for a defective product shall be brought but within three years of the date of injury, and not later than eight years from the date of sale, lease or bailment of such product.
*242 While the record indicates that the furnace was converted to a gas furnace on October 12, 1959, the record also indicates that the offending Baso switch was first installed on September 29, 1961, and the solenoid valve was first installed on March 10, 1961. On subsequent dates there were repeated complaints by the plaintiff to the defendant concerning the furnace, and repeated instructions and advice given to the plaintiff by the defendant.
As suit was brought on September 30, 1968, it is clear that the action was commenced within three years of the accident and within eight years of the installation of the alleged defective device.
We distinguish this case from Prokolkin v. General Motors Corporation, 170 Conn. 289, 365 A.2d 1180, which held that liability for a defective product dates from the sale of the product. That case was based on § 52-577 of the General Statutes, prior to the enactment of § 52-577a.
There is no error.
In this opinion the other judges concurred.
NOTES
[1]  These instructions read:

"1. Close main and pilot burner gas valves and wait at least five minutes for unburned gas to escape.
2. Turn on pilot gas only and ignite pilot gas. Press release button and hold firmly pressed in for 30 seconds. Baso will then remain in operation position and switch will close circuit."
[2]  "[General Statutes] Sec. 52-577a. LIMITATION OF ACTION BASED ON STRICT TORT LIABILITY FOR PRODUCTS IN DEFECTIVE CONDITION. (a) No action to recover damages for injury to the person or to real or personal property caused by any product in a defective condition shall be brought against one who manufactures, sells, leases or bails any such product but within three years from the date when the injury is first sustained, discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered except that no such action may be brought later than eight years from the date of sale, lease or bailment of such product.

(b) In any such action the seller, lessor or bailor may implead any third party who is or may be liable to him for all or part of the plaintiff's claim, if such third party defendant is served with the third party complaint within one year from the date the cause of action brought under subsection (a) of this section is returned to court.
(c) The provisions of this section shall apply to all actions pending on or brought after June 4, 1976 claiming strict liability regardless of the date of the act or omission complained of."
Section 52-577a has been amended by Public Acts 1979, No. 79-483, to provide that the now ten year limitation within which products liability claims must be brought does not apply to consumer claimants.

                        with the savings on my electric bill, I really did nothing 
                        and I still pay CL&P like nothing changed, except 
                        my lower electric bill thanks to you. I will be sure to 
                        send my friends and family members here to sign-up and 
                        save also."
Brad in Stamford, CT
 
                        - "I signed up in March of this year and it is one 
                        of the best decisions I made after moving into my new 
                        home. I have seen a significant savings and have had no 
                        negatives at all. I had been dreading the high cost of 
                        air conditioning my home over the summer. I highly recommend 
                        the switch to everyone interested in saving money."
Danielle in Middletown, CT

                        - "I signed up and received my first bill and I am 
                        very happy with the results. Thank you for the heads up 
                        and the savings. Now I can turn my air conditioning on 
                        this year and not worry about the bill as much, thank 
                        so much."

How to Light a Room: The Specs That Matter
In order to set the tone of a room and achieve the look you want, it's important to be aware of what a light's specifications say about its output. 
                    Learning how to light a room with LED lights depends on more than brightness and lumens. 
                    Do you want to create a relaxed environment, one that's lively and bright, or one that's romantic? 
                    Any look is possible with the right LED lights. 
                    They're available in a variety of intensities, color temperatures (shades) and with different beam angles, dimming capabilities, and color-rendering indexes (CRI).








Lumens

 
Lumens are a measurement of the amount of light produced by a source. 
                    The higher the lumen count, the brighter the light source.
                    Lumens are often the deciding factor when it comes to purchasing new LED light bulbs or fixtures.
                    They're a more reliable metric to use than choosing a light based on its wattage.
                    An LED light with an output that's comparable to a 60-watt incandescent bulb might only consume 10 watts of power.
                    Kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and closets are areas where high lumen counts would be beneficial, but brightness, as with any other lighting choice, is entirely up to you and the look you want for your room.
                    LED bulbs are available in many intensities, but those intensities often depend on the light's color temperature—otherwise known as the shade of white light being emitted.
                





Correlated Color Temperature (CCT)








CCT indicates the hue and tone of white light emitted from a specific bulb or fixture. 
                    It's measured in Kelvins (K), which is similar to degrees in Celsius. 
                    Different temperatures on the Kelvin scale represent different colors. 
                    For example, light at 2000K-3500K looks more orange/yellow and is called ultra warm or warm white, and as temperature increases in Kelvins, color changes to more of a “paper white” known as natural or neutral white (between 3500K and 5100K) and finally into a bluish-white known as cool white (5100K+). 
                    As a light source's color temperature increases, brightness often increases.
                    While shopping for LED lights, pay close attention to the color temperatures that are available for any one bulb or fixture. 
                    Choosing a warm white bulb with a color temperature around 3000K might mean sacrificing some brightness. 
                    Whereas, if you choose the natural white version, it's likely that it will have a higher output.
                

Traditionally, different rooms are associated with different tones. For example, living rooms and nurseries tend to have soft warm white light. 
                    A warm white light source will highlight other warm colors in a room, is least likely to show imperfections, and appears less bright when compared to higher CCTs.
                    In kitchens, basements, garages, and other areas where tasks are completed, it's standard to have natural or even cool white bulbs or fixtures because of the crisp, bright white light that they emit.
                





Color-Rendering Index (CRI)










CRI indicates how accurately a light source reveals the true colors of objects, people, clothing, etc. when compared to how colors are shown in incandescent light or daylight.
                    The closer a light’s CRI is to 100 (the CRI of incandescent light or daylight), the better the color rendition of objects under that light.
                    Any room can benefit from high-CRI LED lights.
                    They're great for living room lighting as they will show paint and furniture colors accurately. Kitchens, closets, bathrooms, dressing rooms, and other areas where presentation, appearance, and depth of color are important can also benefit from high-CRI LED lights.
                    Accurate color rendering can be achieved with a high-cri light strip, can light, globe bulb, linear light, or other high-CRI bulb or fixture.
                    Lights with a CRI of 80 or higher are considered to show colors most accurately. The CRI of an LED light generally ranges from 70 to 98.
                




Nanometers


In order to understand nanometers, you must first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and wavelengths. 
                    The electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of invisible and visible light, and a wavelength is the distance between peaks of light waves.
                    Wavelengths are measured in nanometers, which are simply units of length that indicate colors of light within the spectrum. 
                    Nanometers will tell you how red, green, yellow, purple, etc. a light source really is. 
                    These measurements start lower at ultraviolet and increase from green to blue, yellow, orange, and then red.
                    The wavelength of a colored light can be found in the light's specifications table.
                





Beam Angle





Fixtures or bulbs that emit wide beams, such as LED panel lights or BR LED bulbs for can lights are great for areas that require a lot of light, such as basements, kitchens, or living rooms. 
                    Narrow beam angles like those from can lights with LED PAR bulbs or track lights with MR LED bulbs are best for highlighting decor or small areas. Globe bulbs, such as A19 or G30 LED vanity bulbs, have 360-degree beam angles, which means that they throw light in all directions. 
                    Globe bulbs are the perfect choice for centralized light fixtures.
                



Beam angle or pattern is a measurement of the angles that are formed between a cone of light’s brightest point (the center) and the points on both sides of the center where the light’s intensity is 50 percent as bright.
                    A larger beam angle means a wider spread of light across an area and vice versa with small beam angles. 
                    While it depends on the angle and individual retailers, small beam patterns are often referred to as spot beams, and larger angles (usually anything above 90 degrees) are considered flood beams.
                







Dimmability


Dimmable LED bulbs and fixtures allow you to adjust the lighting in any room to match its function during a particular time. 
                    For example, in a living room or theater room, you might want low light for watching TV but high light output for a gathering of friends.
                    They're also great for bathrooms where you need bright light to get ready but want dim lighting for relaxing in a bathtub. 
                    Dimmable chandelier bulbs, for example, can create the perfect atmosphere for a family dinner while also allowing enough light for the room to function as a work space for school projects. 
                    When dimmed, these LED lights also reduce energy consumption. 
                    They're available in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and colors from A19 LED bulbs to LED panel lights and retrofit LED can lights.

Contemporary lighting is an updated mix of the latest trends and styles. Classified by simple smooth angles, grays, monochromes, mixed with clear or white glass.
	




Modern lighting is characterized by clean, sharp lines dominantly in brushed steels and chromes. Modern Lighting transforms lighting fixtures into an artpiece for your home.
	




Traditional lighting is characterized by smooth classic lines that range a variety of historical periods and will make any home look more elegant.
	






Transitional lighting is defined as a mix of contemporary and traditional. This style fuses two top selling styles into one beautiful design for your space.
	




Rustic lighting is known for use of earthy tones, sturdy wrought irons and antler decorations. Rustic lighting fits in everything from a cabin, home in the mountains, or home in the suburbs.
	




Colonial lighting is marked by simple, traditional lines often combined with the use of basic woods or irons. Lanterns, chandeliers and wall sconces with candle-style bulbs make a simple yet attractive luminaire for any space.

Voltage



Low Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on low voltage direct current (DC) between 12V and 24V. They require an external transformer, and can easily be installed by a homeowner. Wiring between lights can be buried directly in the ground
		






Line Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on mains power, which is the same power that is inside your home (AC). They do not require an external transformer, but they are best left to professional installation, since they must pass electrical code inspection in most areas.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.
