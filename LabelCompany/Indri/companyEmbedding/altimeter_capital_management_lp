Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

MENLO PARK, Calif. and BOSTON, April 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Altimeter Capital Management, LP (Altimeter), a long-term owner of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:    UAL) (United), on March 8, 2016, nominated six highly qualified professionals for the United Board of Directors at this year's Annual Stockholder Meeting, which is expected to be held in June. Altimeter and its partner in this effort, PAR Capital Management, Inc. (PAR), collectively own approximately 7.1% of United's outstanding common stock. 








To provide more information about why change is urgently required on the United Board, Altimeter and PAR today launched www.UnitedCourseCorrection.com. The website consolidates previously released information and highlights the outstanding backgrounds and track records of the six stockholder nominees, including nominee statements and endorsements.  In the coming weeks, the website will also include a more detailed stockholder analysis illustrating the United Board's failure and the need for change.  
Altimeter and PAR expect to update the website regularly, with additional information about their views on United and its Board, as well as the six stockholder nominees. Directly on the www.UnitedCourseCorrection.com website, interested parties can sign up to receive notices of future press releases and proxy materials regarding the stockholder campaign to nominate a minority Board slate at United. 
As stockholders interested in United's long-term health and performance, Altimeter and PAR believe that the United Board has been ineffective at driving performance of the company and stock, despite United having industry-leading assets, a dedicated labor force, and an unparalleled global brand.
United stockholders with questions about the Company's Annual Meeting also can contact Okapi Partners, the stockholders' proxy solicitor, toll-free at (855) 305-0857.
About Altimeter Capital Altimeter is a global investment firm managing both public and private funds focused on the airline, travel, technology, internet, software, and consumer sectors.  Altimeter was founded in 2008 by Brad Gerstner and has offices in Boston, Massachusetts and Menlo Park, California.
About PAR Capital Management PAR Capital Management manages a private investment fund.  The firm was founded in 1990 and is located in Boston, Massachusetts.  PAR's philosophy is based on the belief that long term investment success can be achieved through narrowly focused and rigorous fundamental research, disciplined portfolio management and the alignment of incentives between manager and client.
