Overview
Cimarex is a leading exploration and production company with operations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico.  Most of our drilling takes place in the Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring Sands in the Permian Basin and in the Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma.  Driven by strong rates of return from oil and liquids-rich natural gas opportunities, Cimarex invested $877 million on exploration and development activities in the Permian and Mid-Continent in 2015 and plans to invest $600-$650 million in these areas during 2016.
Cimarex has successfully grown proved reserves to 2.9 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) at December 31, 2015, a three-year compounded annual growth rate of nine percent.  High-return oil and natural gas liquids account for 48 percent of total proved reserves, up from 33 percent five years ago.  Daily production averaged 985 MMcf of gas equivalent (MMcfe) during 2015; 47 percent natural gas; 31 percent oil and 22 percent natural gas liquids.

Home  >  Operations  >  Permian BasinPermian Basin


Located in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico, the Permian Basin is one of the oldest oil and gas producing basins in the United States.  Hydrocarbons formed when the Permian sea retreated to the south leaving behind an elliptically-shaped layer of thick sediment which has been explored and developed in a multitude of zones since the first commercial well was drilled in 1921.  The Permian Basin is made up of several smaller basins including the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform.  Cimarex operations are focused in the Delaware Basin where the company has a strong land position with multiple horizontal drilling opportunities in the Wolfcamp Shale, Bone Spring Sands and Avalon Shale.
The prolific oil-producing Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations account for most of the company’s current Permian Basin activity and production.  Delineation of the Wolfcamp Shale continues with first infill development planned for 2016. Cimarex continues to see marked improvement in well results due to newer completion techniques and the use of longer laterals.
The Permian Basin accounted for 36 percent of Cimarex’s year-end 2015 proved reserves and 56% of total production.

Still A Value Trap? – Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC), Splunk Inc. (SPLK)

By Luis Castro -   July 19, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE:XEC) observed rebound of 4.92% since bottoming out at $89.49 on Jul. 07, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 0.47% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -30.91% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -36.11% from $146.96 , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 12, 2016, but are collecting gains at -20.64% for the past 12 months.
XEC Target Price Reaches $136.09
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC)’s shares projecting a $136.09 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC)’s Sales Declined?
 XEC’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -6.5% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 85.9% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Splunk Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Cimarex Energy Co. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -6.26%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 5.42%, and the sector’s average is 82.32%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -12.13% since hitting a peak level of $69.23 on May. 15, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 5.79% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 18.92% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 20.12% higher from $50.64, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Dec. 30, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 14.13% for the past six months.
Analysts See Splunk Inc. 11.53% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Splunk Inc. (SPLK) to grow. At recent closing price of $60.83, SPLK has a chance to add $11.53 or 18.95% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($72.36) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 2.21 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Splunk Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly -37.9%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 43.47%, annually.
Is SPLK Turning Profits into Returns?
 Splunk Inc. (SPLK)’s ROE is -44.37%, while industry’s is 16.67%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.41%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Splunk Inc.’s ROA is -22.54%, while industry’s average is 10.2%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 9.61. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 2.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent of estimated proved reserves, of which 52% was natural gas and the remainder was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
In 2016, production averaged 963.4 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day, 55% of which came from the Permian Basin and 44% of which came from the Rocky Mountains, particularly the Cana–Woodford in western Oklahoma.[1]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
