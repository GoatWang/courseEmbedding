Appili Therapeutics











Pipeline









Pipeline 


Appili Therapeutics is currently leading several anti-infective programs, at various stages of development. These programs are designed to address the existing critical unmet medical needs of patients with infectious disease, providing novel therapeutics to treat even the most drug-resistant infections.

 




 
 


Gram Negative Program:Antibiotic Repurposing:


Gram Negative Program
 


Appili is developing a small molecule antibiotic to treat nosocomial infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The antibiotic, ATI-1503, inhibits bacterial translation by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. It has a unique binding site and mechanism of action, representing a novel class of antibiotic.





Antibiotic Repurposing
 


Appili is repurposing an existing antibiotic through the FDA’s 505(b)(2) new drug application process, an appealing regulatory strategy that helps avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on the previously approved drug. This antibiotic, ATI-1501, will address an identified unmet medical need. The program is currently confidential, with the target and program details to be announced upon entering the clinic in early 2017.

Appili Therapeutics











Strategy









Focus 


Our primary focus is the development of therapeutics to treat infectious disease that provide “differentiated benefits” to patients. We are actively seeking innovative solutions that target infectious disease, with a particular focus on agents that address the rising concern of multi-drug resistant bacteria. With resources and experts available to analyse and develop promising anti-infective therapeutic programs, we are interested in developing novel solutions to the current crises of infectious disease, irrespective of disease, method of delivery and stage of development.

 




  




Favorable Regulatory Environment










The GAIN Act: Improvements to the Regulatory Environment 










Priority Review Voucher Program










Recent regulatory changes have incentivized the development of anti-infective agents to increase commercialization:
The Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act (GAIN Act) grants an additional five years of market exclusivity, as well as a streamlined process for priority review by the FDA.
The Neglected Tropical Disease Voucher Program is an incentive for companies to invest in new drugs for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases through the award of a transferable “priority review vouchers.” A Priority Review Voucher can be applied to any drug development program, and typically reduces the time for the FDA to review a new drug application to as little as six months.






The Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, which came into effect on October 1, 2012, provides a favorable environment for the development of new antibiotics. Under GAIN, a qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) is a new “antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens.” Under the Act, sponsors developing QIDPs may benefit from the following incentives:

Market exclusivity. QIDPs would be issued five years of market exclusivity in addition to the periods of exclusivity for which they would otherwise qualify. In the US, new small molecule drugs are granted five years of Hatch Waxman market exclusivity, so this provision would provide a total of ten years of market exclusivity regardless of patent position.
Priority review. QIDPs would qualify for Priority Review by the FDA, which would cut the time to approval to six months.
Fast track review. Sponsors of QIDPs would be provided with early and frequent communications with the FDA, in addition to the typical review opportunities.
Updated guidance. The GAIN Act provides a specific timetable for the FDA to develop and issue final guidance on how to conduct antibiotics trials.
Pathogen focused drug development. The FDA will issue guidance on pathogen-focused antibacterial drug development rather than disease-focused development that currently exists.







Priority Review Vouchers (PRV) came into effect in 2007, with the first voucher issued in 2009. Under the law, a developer of a treatment for a neglected or rare pediatric disease receives a voucher for priority review from the FDA to be used with a product of its choice. PRVs may also be sold to other pharmaceutical companies to improve the return on investment in areas of drug development that previously struggled from a lack of innovation due to more challenging markets. The first three sales of PRVs are detailed below:

The first sale of its kind, BioMarin sold their PRV to Sanofi and Regeneron for $67.5M (August 2014)
Knight Therapeutics was awarded a PRV upon the approval of Impavido, developed to treat leishmaniasis. This voucher was sold for $125M to Gilead Sciences (November 2014)
Retrophin will receive a total of $245M from Sanofi in exchange for their PRV (May 2015)

HALIFAX, Nova Scotia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Appili Therapeutics Inc. (“Appili”), an anti-infective drug development 
      company, announced today that Sean McBride, a 26 year pharmaceutical

      Mr. McBride will lead Appili’s out-licensing, product in-licensing and

      "We are delighted to have Mr. McBride join our strong leadership team,” 
      said Kevin Sullivan, CEO of Appili Therapeutics. “Sean’s experience in 
      international deal-making, along with his expertise in pharmaceutical 
      sales and marketing will be invaluable as we build our balanced-risk 
      pipeline of near-to-revenue opportunities with higher-risk, 
      transformational drugs that can truly change the way we treat infectious 
      disease.”
    

      “This is an exciting time to be joining the Appili team as it seeks to 
      take advantage of the many incentives aimed at fighting antibiotic 
      resistance and grow its pipeline of anti-infectives,” said Mr. McBride. 
      “There are many players including government, non-profit, and for-profit 
      organizations with an interest in infectious diseases and I look forward 
      to bringing my experience working with these organizations, and 
      contributing to the Company’s future success.”
    

      Mr. McBride brings more than two decades of experience within the 
      Canadian pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. His expertise lies 
      in licensing, purchasing and divesting assets, in addition to advancing

About Appili TherapeuticsAppili is dedicated to 
      identifying, acquiring and advancing novel therapeutics for infectious 
      disease. The Company has two anti-infective programs, ATI-1501 and 
      ATI-1503, in its pipeline. ATI-1501 is a taste-masked treatment for

      Health Organization as posing the 
      highest threat to human health. For more information visit www.AppiliTherapeutics.com.

Press Release
submit a press release send this to a friend Go back to listAppili Therapeutics Inc. Appoints Pharmaceutical Executive Sean McBride as Vice President, Business DevelopmentAppili TherapeuticsPosted on: 06 Jul 17More Appili Therapeutics press releases
      Appili Therapeutics Inc. (“Appili”), an anti-infective drug development 
      company, announced today that Sean McBride, a 26 year pharmaceutical 
      veteran, has joined the company as Vice President, Business Development. 
      Mr. McBride will lead Appili’s out-licensing, product in-licensing and 
      acquisition opportunities as the company builds its pipeline of 
      infectious disease products.
    

      "We are delighted to have Mr. McBride join our strong leadership team,” 
      said Kevin Sullivan, CEO of Appili Therapeutics. “Sean’s experience in 
      international deal-making, along with his expertise in pharmaceutical 
      sales and marketing will be invaluable as we build our balanced-risk 
      pipeline of near-to-revenue opportunities with higher-risk, 
      transformational drugs that can truly change the way we treat infectious 
      disease.”
    

      “This is an exciting time to be joining the Appili team as it seeks to 
      take advantage of the many incentives aimed at fighting antibiotic 
      resistance and grow its pipeline of anti-infectives,” said Mr. McBride. 
      “There are many players including government, non-profit, and for-profit 
      organizations with an interest in infectious diseases and I look forward 
      to bringing my experience working with these organizations, and 
      contributing to the Company’s future success.”
    

      Mr. McBride brings more than two decades of experience within the 
      Canadian pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. His expertise lies 
      in licensing, purchasing and divesting assets, in addition to advancing 
      the commercialization of early stage assets and identifying 
      opportunities for growth. Prior to joining Appili, Mr. McBride spent 10 
      years at GlaxoSmithKline 
      Inc. (GSK) serving in many roles of increasing responsibility. Most 
      recently he served as head of an entrepreneurial business unit where he 
      negotiated global asset transactions and was responsible for the 
      commercial success of over 40 brand assets. Prior to joining GSK, Mr. 
      McBride served as a director for healthcare agencies conducting 
      commercial and strategic assessments in both Canada and the US and also 
      served as director of marketing with Roche 
      Pharmaceuticals. Mr. McBride has a Bachelor of Business 
      Administration from Simon Fraser University.
    

About Appili Therapeutics
Appili is dedicated to 
      identifying, acquiring and advancing novel therapeutics for infectious 
      disease. The Company has two anti-infective programs, ATI-1501 and 
      ATI-1503, in its pipeline. ATI-1501 is a taste-masked treatment for 
      anaerobic infections that has been granted orphan drug status by the 
      FDA. Appili plans to take ATI-1501 into clinical trials in 2017. 
      Appili’s second product, ATI-1503, is a novel antibiotic with broad 
      potential to treat deadly Gram-negative infections. These drug-resistant 
      infections have been identified by the U.S. 
      Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World 
      Health Organizationas posing the 
      highest threat to human health. For more information visit www.AppiliTherapeutics.com.
