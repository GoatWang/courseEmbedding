Community Foundation of Noble County |   Earley, Benjamin B. and Kathleen June Memorial Scholarship Fund

Earley, Benjamin B. and Kathleen June Memorial Scholarship Fund$750.00

For an East Noble High School senior planning to attend Ball State University. It is a one-time payment of $750. (NCCF)

Donor Fund Story:
Kathleen June Earley was born in Kendallville on June 1, 1927, in the farmhouse where she grew up. She was the daughter of Carl and Katherine (Weingart) Mabus. She went to the original Wayne Center School. After graduating from Kendallville High School, she went to Ball State and graduated with a degree in Teaching. Benjamin “Ben” Earley was born on November 5, 1921 in Bluffton, Indiana, the son of Benjamin and Margaret Earley. Ben attended Anderson High School and graduated from Ball State University in 1943, majoring in History. He received his Master’s Degree from Indiana University. Kathleen and Ben were married on August 3, 1952 in Muncie, Indiana.
Kathleen taught at Muncie Central for seven years and was where she first met Ben. Kathleen moved to Kendallville from Rushville in 1965. After obtaining her B.A. and M.A. she worked as a business teacher, retiring from East Noble High School after 19 years there. She also assisted her sister at The Toggery Men’s Store in Kendallville.
Ben began his teaching career at Noblesville High School where he served as assistant basketball coach. He then became a History teacher at Muncie Central High School. Three years later he was asked to become Assistant Principal and Dean of Boys at Muncie Central. A bit of trivia, Ben was actually at the Muncie Central vs. Milan game (movie Hoosiers is based on this). In 1957, he became Principal of the Rushville High School. Then from 1965 to 1984, he was the Principal at the Kendallville Middle School.
As educators the Earley’s were unique in the way they approached their profession. Way before it was politically correct Ben made boys take “Home Ec.” and girls take “shop”. Kathleen tried never to use the same lesson plan again. She stayed up late at night to work on new ones.
Kathleen was a member of Tri Kappa in Muncie and Rushville, Alpha Sigma Alpha Sorority, American Association of University Women, Delta Kappa Gamma in Muncie, the Indiana Teachers’ Association. She played the violin for four years with the Muncie Symphony and the Ball State Symphony Orchestra and was involved in community concerts.
Ben was a member of the Phi Delta Kappa, Alpha Chapter at Indiana University. He was Past President of both the Rushville and Kendallville Rotary Clubs. Ben had many interests including sports, exercise, reading, family and Bible study.
The Earley’s had strong beliefs in religion and volunteered in many aspects of Trinity United Methodist Church. They were always supportive of their kids in whatever endeavor they undertook. They believed in hard work and treating people the right way. They cherished their grandchildren who referred to them as “Ba” and “Nana”. They treasured the time they could spend with them.
They both made a bigger difference in the lives of people that needed it rather than those that didn’t need it. It’s said that when you leave a place it’s not what you take with you, it’s rather what you leave behind. The Earley’s left a legacy of their life!
