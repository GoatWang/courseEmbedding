For rollovers via check:

The Rollover IRA account number should be included on the check.
If rolling over to a Roth IRA:

The plan administrator should mail the check to:

If the plan administrator does not send the check directly to E*TRADE, simply forward it along with an IRA Deposit Slip to E*TRADE at the address above.
For securities rollovers:
The plan administrator should forward securities to DTC Clearing 0385, Code 40.
Or, if the plan administrator wants to mail certificates, the certificates should clearly indicate the E*TRADE Rollover or Roth IRA account number and are registered to the following:

 Coming Soon: Additional Benefits for Your Employees!
 We continue to look for ways to deliver value to your employees with innovative, high quality financial solutions. That’s why we are pleased to introduce the new E*TRADE Complete Investment Account. With E*TRADE Complete, your employees can continue to manage their stock plan benefits—as they would today—and gain access to the following tools:

 A complete view of all E*TRADE employee stock plan, brokerage, and bank accounts in one place, providing employees with an easy and convenient way to manage all of their finances 
 Full-featured cash management tools including online checking, bill pay, and a new Intelligent Cash Optimizer tool which instantly calculates the earning potential of uninvested cash1
 Attractive rates of up to 2.25% APY on the high-yield Money Market Account2
 Platinum Debit Card with ATM fee refunds at any ATM nationwide3
 Free Optional Digital Security ID that makes unauthorized log-on virtually impossible4

 In the coming weeks, we will be rolling out the E*TRADE Complete Investment Account in phases to ensure a smooth transition. Employees who activate their new employee stock plan accounts after March 23, 2005 will automatically receive a new E*TRADE Complete Investment Account. Current employees with active retail brokerage accounts will receive communications—between late March and mid-May—when their account is upgraded to E*TRADE Complete. 
 1. The Intelligent Cash Optimizer is available to Priority E*TRADE and Power E*TRADE customers. 
 2. The E*TRADE Money Market Account is offered by E*TRADE Bank. Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 2.25% as of 3/15/05 and applies to accounts with balances of $50,000 or more. Accounts with balances of $5,000 - $49,999 will earn 1.75% APY and accounts with balances of less than $5,000 will earn 0.30% APY. A $100 minimum deposit is required to open an account and you must maintain a balance of $1,000 or $5,000 in total E*TRADE Bank deposits, by the end of your second statement cycle, to avoid a $10 monthly fee on the account. This fee is waived for Power E*TRADE and Priority E*TRADE customers. Fees may reduce earnings. Yield subject to change daily. 
 3. We will not charge you a fee for withdrawing funds from any ATM but the owner/operator of some ATMs may. In those cases, E*TRADE will automatically refund your account for the amount of the fee by the end of the following business day. Priority E*TRADE and Power E*TRADE customers get unlimited ATM fee refunds. Other customers get up to five ATM fee refunds per month. 
 4. The Digital Security ID will be provided at no cost to Power E*TRADE and Priority E*TRADE customers. A $25 charge may be imposed for each additional or replacement Digital Security ID. E*TRADE FINANCIAL at its sole discretion may impose a fee for this service in the future or may discontinue the service.  
 This security authentication system is based on technology from RSA Security Inc. If used properly, this security technology will not permit unauthorized access. While we continuously strive to provide the best available security technology, no guarantee can be made that new methods may not emerge to circumvent this technology.


  End-to-End Restricted Stock Administration & Participant Services
In May, our enhanced restricted stock solution, including support for online deferrals, tax payment elections, and tax payments at etrade.com, will be widely available.
 Your employees can now make deferral and tax payment elections at etrade.com based on parameters you define. These parameters, which you can customize by grant, include: 

 Online deferral elections: enable employees to make deferrals on specific restricted stock unit grants to a future date or event, such as retirement. 
 Online tax payment elections: provide employees with a convenient way to make deferrals and tax payment elections online. Choices include same-day sale, sell-to-cover, cash transfer, check/wire, payroll deduction, withhold shares, swap shares, and do not withhold tax. 
 Online tax payments: ease the administrative burden of collecting taxes and alleviate cash flow concerns for both you and your employees through a same-day sale, sell-to-cover, or cash transfer. 

 Our enhanced restricted stock service at etrade.com is fully integrated with Equity Edge 6. Equity Edge 6 enhancements that further streamline the administration of your restricted stock plans include: 

 Restricted stock unit support 
 Deferral and tax payment election tracking 
 Enhanced reporting

      E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) today announced results for 
      its second quarter ended June 30, 2017, reporting net income of $193 
      million and $0.70 diluted earnings per common share. This compares to 
      net income of $145 million, or $0.48 diluted earnings per common share, 
      in the prior quarter. This also compares to net income of $133 million, 
      or $0.48 diluted earnings per common share, in the second quarter of 
      2016. Total net revenue of $577 million increased from net revenue of 
      $553 million in the prior quarter and $474 million in the second quarter 
      of 2016. Operating margin for the quarter was 55 percent and adjusted 
      operating margin was 38 percent(1) which compares to 41 
      percent and 38 percent(1) in the prior quarter and 45 percent 
      and 38 percent(1) in the year-ago quarter.
    

      “The impressive results we recorded the last quarter proved to be only 
      the beginning of our positive drumbeat that continued steadier and 
      louder this quarter,” said Karl Roessner, Chief Executive Officer. 
      “There is a lot to be excited about with our brokerage performance and 
      bottom-line results. First, customer activity held strong, while 
      derivatives increased to a record portion of customer trades during the 
      quarter. Margin balances reached 3-year highs and net new brokerage 
      assets represented our strongest second quarter on record. In pursuit of 
      our goal to reclaim our irreverent, challenger-brand status, we launched 
      a bold new advertising campaign toward quarter-end. Further, our balance 
      sheet growth is progressing as planned. As we move into the second half 
      of the year, we are poised to execute on several critical initiatives: 
      completion of the integration of OptionsHouse, continued balance sheet 
      growth, and the launch of a new $1 billion share repurchase 
      program—enabled by our strong financial performance and a reduction in 
      our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold to 6.5 percent. Fueled 
      by our singular focus on doing what is right for our customers and our 
      shareholders, the team continues to deliver. While we have produced 
      outstanding results in the first half of 2017, I am even more energized 
      by what I believe we will accomplish in the months and years ahead.”
    

      Michael Pizzi, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “This quarter’s 
      results include a few noteworthy items, the most prominent being a $99 
      million benefit to provision for loan losses. Virtually all loans have 
      converted from interest-only, and a significant portion have been 
      amortizing for more than 12 months. The outperformance of these loans 
      relative to our modeled expectations drove the reduction to the 
      allowance and benefit to provision. Additionally, our results include $9 
      million of one-time communications expense associated with customer 
      market data and $9 million of integration and implementation expenses 
      related to OptionsHouse and crossing $50 billion in balance sheet 
      assets. These costs were reflected primarily in professional services 
      and restructuring. The cumulative impact these one-time items on net 
      income was $50 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the quarter.”

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures


      Management believes that adjusting GAAP measures by excluding or 
      including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may 
      wish to use some or all of this information to analyze the Company’s 
      current performance, prospects and valuation. Management uses this 
      non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in 
      formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the 
      non-GAAP measures discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the 
      operating and liquidity performance of the Company.
    

Adjusted Operating Margin


      Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income 
      before income taxes by net revenue. Adjusted income before income taxes 
      excludes the provision (benefit) for loan losses. Management believes 
      that excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses from operating 
      margin provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating 
      performance because management excludes it when evaluating operating 
      margin performance. See endnote (1) for a reconciliation of this 
      non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
    

Corporate Cash


      Corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as 
      cash held in certain subsidiaries, not including bank and broker-dealer 
      subsidiaries, that can distribute cash to the parent company without any 
      regulatory approval or notification. The Company believes that corporate 
      cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the

      regulated subsidiaries. See endnote (5) for a reconciliation of this 
      non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.
    

Tangible Common Equity Book Value per Share


      Tangible common equity book value per share represents common 
      shareholders’ equity, which excludes preferred stock, less goodwill and 
      other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities) 
      divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible 
      common equity book value per share is a measure of the Company’s capital 
      strength. See endnote (4) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure 
      to the comparable GAAP measure.
    

      It is important to note that these non-GAAP measures may involve 
      judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as 
      substitutes for, or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with 
      GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP 
      measures, please see the Company’s financial statements and 
      “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
      of Operations” that will be included in the periodic report the Company 
      expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods 
      discussed herein.

      (1) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in 
      income before income taxes. The percentage is calculated by dividing 
      income before income taxes by total net revenue. The following table 
      provides a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin percentage to 
      non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage (dollars in millions):

          Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance 
          sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and 
          off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
          categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor 
          or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each 
          risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
          that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk 
          categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.

History[edit]
In 1982, William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb founded TradePlus in Palo Alto, California with $15,000 in capital. In 1991 Porter and Newcomb founded a new company, E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E*Trade offered its trading services via America Online and Compuserve. In 1994 its revenues neared $11 million, up from $850,000 in 1992.[2]
By June 30, 1996, the company had 73,000 customers and processed 8,000 trades per day, with quarterly revenue of $15 million.[3]
In August 16,1996, the company executed an initial public offering.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired Web Street Securities, a publicly traded online brokerage firm, for $45 million in stock. Web Street had offices in Beverly Hills, Boston, Denver, and San Francisco.[5]
In 2003, Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its TD Waterhouse discount brokerage with E*Trade, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity.[6] TD Waterhouse wound up merging with Ameritrade to form TD Ameritrade.[7] After the merger, E*Trade continued talks to merge with TD Ameritrade but the two sides could not agree on price and governance rights.[8]
In August 2005, E*Trade Financial acquired Harrisdirect, formerly a discount brokerage service of Bank of Montreal. Two months later, E*Trade acquired Brown & Company (aka BrownCo), formerly a discount brokerage service of JPMorgan Chase & Co., for $1.6 billion in cash.[9]
Subprime portfolio divestiture in 2007[edit]




E*Trade Financial Center, San Francisco


In July 2007, Etrade Australia, which was a separately operated company owned 6% by E*Trade Financial, was purchased by Australian ANZ Bank for $432 million.[10]
On November 29, 2007, E-Trade announced a transaction in which Citadel LLC invested $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for the company's securitized subprime mortgages, 12.5% senior unsecured notes, and 84,687,686 shares of common stock (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). The transaction removed the assets with the greatest market risk from E-Trade's consolidated balance sheet—the $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien securities. This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on the company's balance sheet. Citadel received a seat on E-Trade Financial's Board of Directors and Mitch Caplan resigned as E-Trade's CEO. Although E-Trade's management admitted that the deal was costly for the company, it removed the risk associated with the subprime investments and resulted in an infusion of $2.5 billion in cash.[11]
Post subprime reorganization[edit]
In November 2007, E*Trade revoked the brand name license from SBI E*Trade Securities in Japan.[12]
In March 2008, E*Trade named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E*Trade's board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal.[13]
In July 2008, E*Trade sold its Canadian division to Scotiabank for CAD$444 million, as part of a program to stabilize the company.[14]
In December 2009, Robert Druskin, a former chief operating officer of Citigroup Inc. was named interim CEO and chairman.[15]
On March 22, 2010, Steven Freiberg, former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of the bank's credit card unit, was named as E*Trade's new CEO while Druskin continued in his role as board chairman. The company also announced it would seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.[16]
On January 17, 2013, Paul T. Idzik was appointed CEO. Idzik had previously been Group Chief Executive of DTZ and also served ten years at Barclays bank.[17]
On September 12, 2016, E*Trade acquired the parent company of OptionsHouse for $725 million and Karl A. Roessner was appointed CEO.[18]
Advertising[edit]
"E*Trade Baby" advertising campaign[edit]
E*Trade Baby was an integrated advertising campaign that appeared in online, television, print, and social media.
The first E*Trade baby was Gregory Michael Miller, taken in March 2001.[19]
In January 2008, E*Trade debuted advertisements during the Super Bowl featuring a talking baby in front of a web cam discussing investing and finance in an adult voice.
The "insufferable brat" returned the following year for Super Bowl XLVII, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube.[20] It is a 30-second "Talking Baby" advertisement. The E*Trade Baby demonstrates a "Save It" initiative that focuses on just how much money is at stake in hidden 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: "come to E*TRADE, and Save It".[21]
The E*Trade baby was voiced by comedian Pete Holmes.
The campaign was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group.[22] At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work.[23]
In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called “Enzo the Tailor,” in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany.[24]
In 2013, the company had over 64 million total views and over 26,000 subscribers on YouTube, more than 108,000 Facebook Baby and Corporate pages fans, and more than 17,000 Twitter followers.[25]
On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*Trade baby via a commercial which aired during March Madness.[26]

The company's primary offices are in Alpharetta, Georgia; Jersey City, New Jersey; Arlington, Virginia; Sandy, Utah; Menlo Park, California; and New York City.
History[edit]
In 1982, William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb founded TradePlus in Palo Alto, California with $15,000 in capital. In 1991 Porter and Newcomb founded a new company, E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E*Trade offered its trading services via America Online and Compuserve. In 1994 its revenues neared $11 million, up from $850,000 in 1992.[2]
By June 30, 1996, the company had 73,000 customers and processed 8,000 trades per day, with quarterly revenue of $15 million.[3]
In August 16,1996, the company executed an initial public offering.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired Web Street Securities, a publicly traded online brokerage firm, for $45 million in stock. Web Street had offices in Beverly Hills, Boston, Denver, and San Francisco.[5]
In 2003, Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its TD Waterhouse discount brokerage with E*Trade, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity.[6] TD Waterhouse wound up merging with Ameritrade to form TD Ameritrade.[7] After the merger, E*Trade continued talks to merge with TD Ameritrade but the two sides could not agree on price and governance rights.[8]
In August 2005, E*Trade Financial acquired Harrisdirect, formerly a discount brokerage service of Bank of Montreal. Two months later, E*Trade acquired Brown & Company (aka BrownCo), formerly a discount brokerage service of JPMorgan Chase & Co., for $1.6 billion in cash.[9]
Subprime portfolio divestiture in 2007[edit]




E*Trade Financial Center, San Francisco


In July 2007, Etrade Australia, which was a separately operated company owned 6% by E*Trade Financial, was purchased by Australian ANZ Bank for $432 million.[10]
On November 29, 2007, E-Trade announced a transaction in which Citadel LLC invested $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for the company's securitized subprime mortgages, 12.5% senior unsecured notes, and 84,687,686 shares of common stock (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). The transaction removed the assets with the greatest market risk from E-Trade's consolidated balance sheet—the $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien securities. This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on the company's balance sheet. Citadel received a seat on E-Trade Financial's Board of Directors and Mitch Caplan resigned as E-Trade's CEO. Although E-Trade's management admitted that the deal was costly for the company, it removed the risk associated with the subprime investments and resulted in an infusion of $2.5 billion in cash.[11]
Post subprime reorganization[edit]
In November 2007, E*Trade revoked the brand name license from SBI E*Trade Securities in Japan.[12]
In March 2008, E*Trade named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E*Trade's board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal.[13]
In July 2008, E*Trade sold its Canadian division to Scotiabank for CAD$444 million, as part of a program to stabilize the company.[14]
In December 2009, Robert Druskin, a former chief operating officer of Citigroup Inc. was named interim CEO and chairman.[15]
On March 22, 2010, Steven Freiberg, former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of the bank's credit card unit, was named as E*Trade's new CEO while Druskin continued in his role as board chairman. The company also announced it would seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.[16]
On January 17, 2013, Paul T. Idzik was appointed CEO. Idzik had previously been Group Chief Executive of DTZ and also served ten years at Barclays bank.[17]
On September 12, 2016, E*Trade acquired the parent company of OptionsHouse for $725 million and Karl A. Roessner was appointed CEO.[18]
Advertising[edit]
"E*Trade Baby" advertising campaign[edit]
E*Trade Baby was an integrated advertising campaign that appeared in online, television, print, and social media.
The first E*Trade baby was Gregory Michael Miller, taken in March 2001.[19]
In January 2008, E*Trade debuted advertisements during the Super Bowl featuring a talking baby in front of a web cam discussing investing and finance in an adult voice.
The "insufferable brat" returned the following year for Super Bowl XLVII, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube.[20] It is a 30-second "Talking Baby" advertisement. The E*Trade Baby demonstrates a "Save It" initiative that focuses on just how much money is at stake in hidden 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: "come to E*TRADE, and Save It".[21]
The E*Trade baby was voiced by comedian Pete Holmes.
The campaign was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group.[22] At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work.[23]
In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called “Enzo the Tailor,” in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany.[24]
In 2013, the company had over 64 million total views and over 26,000 subscribers on YouTube, more than 108,000 Facebook Baby and Corporate pages fans, and more than 17,000 Twitter followers.[25]
On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*Trade baby via a commercial which aired during March Madness.[26]

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 3.5 million brokerage accounts and a total margin receivables balance of $6.731 billion.[1]
In 2016, the company processed 164,134 daily average revenue trades.[1]
In 2016, 59% of net revenue was from interest income, 23% of net revenue was from and commissions for order execution, 14% was from fees for order flow and management services, and 4% was from other sources.[1]
The company has 30 branches.[1]
The company's primary offices are in Alpharetta, Georgia; Jersey City, New Jersey; Arlington, Virginia; Sandy, Utah; Menlo Park, California; and New York City.
History[edit]
In 1982, William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb founded TradePlus in Palo Alto, California with $15,000 in capital. In 1991 Porter and Newcomb founded a new company, E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E*Trade offered its trading services via America Online and Compuserve. In 1994 its revenues neared $11 million, up from $850,000 in 1992.[2]
By June 30, 1996, the company had 73,000 customers and processed 8,000 trades per day, with quarterly revenue of $15 million.[3]
In August 16,1996, the company executed an initial public offering.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired Web Street Securities, a publicly traded online brokerage firm, for $45 million in stock. Web Street had offices in Beverly Hills, Boston, Denver, and San Francisco.[5]
In 2003, Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its TD Waterhouse discount brokerage with E*Trade, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity.[6] TD Waterhouse wound up merging with Ameritrade to form TD Ameritrade.[7] After the merger, E*Trade continued talks to merge with TD Ameritrade but the two sides could not agree on price and governance rights.[8]
In August 2005, E*Trade Financial acquired Harrisdirect, formerly a discount brokerage service of Bank of Montreal. Two months later, E*Trade acquired Brown & Company (aka BrownCo), formerly a discount brokerage service of JPMorgan Chase & Co., for $1.6 billion in cash.[9]
Subprime portfolio divestiture in 2007[edit]




E*Trade Financial Center, San Francisco


In July 2007, Etrade Australia, which was a separately operated company owned 6% by E*Trade Financial, was purchased by Australian ANZ Bank for $432 million.[10]
On November 29, 2007, E-Trade announced a transaction in which Citadel LLC invested $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for the company's securitized subprime mortgages, 12.5% senior unsecured notes, and 84,687,686 shares of common stock (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). The transaction removed the assets with the greatest market risk from E-Trade's consolidated balance sheet—the $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien securities. This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on the company's balance sheet. Citadel received a seat on E-Trade Financial's Board of Directors and Mitch Caplan resigned as E-Trade's CEO. Although E-Trade's management admitted that the deal was costly for the company, it removed the risk associated with the subprime investments and resulted in an infusion of $2.5 billion in cash.[11]
Post subprime reorganization[edit]
In November 2007, E*Trade revoked the brand name license from SBI E*Trade Securities in Japan.[12]
In March 2008, E*Trade named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E*Trade's board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal.[13]
In July 2008, E*Trade sold its Canadian division to Scotiabank for CAD$444 million, as part of a program to stabilize the company.[14]
In December 2009, Robert Druskin, a former chief operating officer of Citigroup Inc. was named interim CEO and chairman.[15]
On March 22, 2010, Steven Freiberg, former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of the bank's credit card unit, was named as E*Trade's new CEO while Druskin continued in his role as board chairman. The company also announced it would seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.[16]
On January 17, 2013, Paul T. Idzik was appointed CEO. Idzik had previously been Group Chief Executive of DTZ and also served ten years at Barclays bank.[17]
On September 12, 2016, E*Trade acquired the parent company of OptionsHouse for $725 million and Karl A. Roessner was appointed CEO.[18]
Advertising[edit]
"E*Trade Baby" advertising campaign[edit]
E*Trade Baby was an integrated advertising campaign that appeared in online, television, print, and social media.
The first E*Trade baby was Gregory Michael Miller, taken in March 2001.[19]
In January 2008, E*Trade debuted advertisements during the Super Bowl featuring a talking baby in front of a web cam discussing investing and finance in an adult voice.
The "insufferable brat" returned the following year for Super Bowl XLVII, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube.[20] It is a 30-second "Talking Baby" advertisement. The E*Trade Baby demonstrates a "Save It" initiative that focuses on just how much money is at stake in hidden 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: "come to E*TRADE, and Save It".[21]
The E*Trade baby was voiced by comedian Pete Holmes.
The campaign was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group.[22] At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work.[23]
In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called “Enzo the Tailor,” in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany.[24]
In 2013, the company had over 64 million total views and over 26,000 subscribers on YouTube, more than 108,000 Facebook Baby and Corporate pages fans, and more than 17,000 Twitter followers.[25]
On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*Trade baby via a commercial which aired during March Madness.[26]

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 3.5 million brokerage accounts and a total margin receivables balance of $6.731 billion.[1]
In 2016, the company processed 164,134 daily average revenue trades.[1]
In 2016, 59% of net revenue was from interest income, 23% of net revenue was from and commissions for order execution, 14% was from fees for order flow and management services, and 4% was from other sources.[1]
The company has 30 branches.[1]
The company's primary offices are in Alpharetta, Georgia; Jersey City, New Jersey; Arlington, Virginia; Sandy, Utah; Menlo Park, California; and New York City.
History[edit]
In 1982, William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb founded TradePlus in Palo Alto, California with $15,000 in capital. In 1991 Porter and Newcomb founded a new company, E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E*Trade offered its trading services via America Online and Compuserve. In 1994 its revenues neared $11 million, up from $850,000 in 1992.[2]
By June 30, 1996, the company had 73,000 customers and processed 8,000 trades per day, with quarterly revenue of $15 million.[3]
In August 16,1996, the company executed an initial public offering.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired Web Street Securities, a publicly traded online brokerage firm, for $45 million in stock. Web Street had offices in Beverly Hills, Boston, Denver, and San Francisco.[5]
In 2003, Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its TD Waterhouse discount brokerage with E*Trade, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity.[6] TD Waterhouse wound up merging with Ameritrade to form TD Ameritrade.[7] After the merger, E*Trade continued talks to merge with TD Ameritrade but the two sides could not agree on price and governance rights.[8]
In August 2005, E*Trade Financial acquired Harrisdirect, formerly a discount brokerage service of Bank of Montreal. Two months later, E*Trade acquired Brown & Company (aka BrownCo), formerly a discount brokerage service of JPMorgan Chase & Co., for $1.6 billion in cash.[9]
Subprime portfolio divestiture in 2007[edit]




E*Trade Financial Center, San Francisco


In July 2007, Etrade Australia, which was a separately operated company owned 6% by E*Trade Financial, was purchased by Australian ANZ Bank for $432 million.[10]
On November 29, 2007, E-Trade announced a transaction in which Citadel LLC invested $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for the company's securitized subprime mortgages, 12.5% senior unsecured notes, and 84,687,686 shares of common stock (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). The transaction removed the assets with the greatest market risk from E-Trade's consolidated balance sheet—the $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien securities. This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on the company's balance sheet. Citadel received a seat on E-Trade Financial's Board of Directors and Mitch Caplan resigned as E-Trade's CEO. Although E-Trade's management admitted that the deal was costly for the company, it removed the risk associated with the subprime investments and resulted in an infusion of $2.5 billion in cash.[11]
Post subprime reorganization[edit]
In November 2007, E*Trade revoked the brand name license from SBI E*Trade Securities in Japan.[12]
In March 2008, E*Trade named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E*Trade's board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal.[13]
In July 2008, E*Trade sold its Canadian division to Scotiabank for CAD$444 million, as part of a program to stabilize the company.[14]
In December 2009, Robert Druskin, a former chief operating officer of Citigroup Inc. was named interim CEO and chairman.[15]
On March 22, 2010, Steven Freiberg, former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of the bank's credit card unit, was named as E*Trade's new CEO while Druskin continued in his role as board chairman. The company also announced it would seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.[16]
On January 17, 2013, Paul T. Idzik was appointed CEO. Idzik had previously been Group Chief Executive of DTZ and also served ten years at Barclays bank.[17]
On September 12, 2016, E*Trade acquired the parent company of OptionsHouse for $725 million and Karl A. Roessner was appointed CEO.[18]
Advertising[edit]
"E*Trade Baby" advertising campaign[edit]
E*Trade Baby was an integrated advertising campaign that appeared in online, television, print, and social media.
The first E*Trade baby was Gregory Michael Miller, taken in March 2001.[19]
In January 2008, E*Trade debuted advertisements during the Super Bowl featuring a talking baby in front of a web cam discussing investing and finance in an adult voice.
The "insufferable brat" returned the following year for Super Bowl XLVII, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube.[20] It is a 30-second "Talking Baby" advertisement. The E*Trade Baby demonstrates a "Save It" initiative that focuses on just how much money is at stake in hidden 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: "come to E*TRADE, and Save It".[21]
The E*Trade baby was voiced by comedian Pete Holmes.
The campaign was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group.[22] At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work.[23]
In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called “Enzo the Tailor,” in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany.[24]
In 2013, the company had over 64 million total views and over 26,000 subscribers on YouTube, more than 108,000 Facebook Baby and Corporate pages fans, and more than 17,000 Twitter followers.[25]
On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*Trade baby via a commercial which aired during March Madness.[26]

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 3.5 million brokerage accounts and a total margin receivables balance of $6.731 billion.[1]
In 2016, the company processed 164,134 daily average revenue trades.[1]
In 2016, 59% of net revenue was from interest income, 23% of net revenue was from and commissions for order execution, 14% was from fees for order flow and management services, and 4% was from other sources.[1]
The company has 30 branches.[1]
The company's primary offices are in Alpharetta, Georgia; Jersey City, New Jersey; Arlington, Virginia; Sandy, Utah; Menlo Park, California; and New York City.
History[edit]
In 1982, William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb founded TradePlus in Palo Alto, California with $15,000 in capital. In 1991 Porter and Newcomb founded a new company, E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E*Trade offered its trading services via America Online and Compuserve. In 1994 its revenues neared $11 million, up from $850,000 in 1992.[2]
By June 30, 1996, the company had 73,000 customers and processed 8,000 trades per day, with quarterly revenue of $15 million.[3]
In August 16,1996, the company executed an initial public offering.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired Web Street Securities, a publicly traded online brokerage firm, for $45 million in stock. Web Street had offices in Beverly Hills, Boston, Denver, and San Francisco.[5]
In 2003, Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its TD Waterhouse discount brokerage with E*Trade, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity.[6] TD Waterhouse wound up merging with Ameritrade to form TD Ameritrade.[7] After the merger, E*Trade continued talks to merge with TD Ameritrade but the two sides could not agree on price and governance rights.[8]
In August 2005, E*Trade Financial acquired Harrisdirect, formerly a discount brokerage service of Bank of Montreal. Two months later, E*Trade acquired Brown & Company (aka BrownCo), formerly a discount brokerage service of JPMorgan Chase & Co., for $1.6 billion in cash.[9]
Subprime portfolio divestiture in 2007[edit]




E*Trade Financial Center, San Francisco


In July 2007, Etrade Australia, which was a separately operated company owned 6% by E*Trade Financial, was purchased by Australian ANZ Bank for $432 million.[10]
On November 29, 2007, E-Trade announced a transaction in which Citadel LLC invested $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for the company's securitized subprime mortgages, 12.5% senior unsecured notes, and 84,687,686 shares of common stock (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). The transaction removed the assets with the greatest market risk from E-Trade's consolidated balance sheet—the $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien securities. This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on the company's balance sheet. Citadel received a seat on E-Trade Financial's Board of Directors and Mitch Caplan resigned as E-Trade's CEO. Although E-Trade's management admitted that the deal was costly for the company, it removed the risk associated with the subprime investments and resulted in an infusion of $2.5 billion in cash.[11]
Post subprime reorganization[edit]
In November 2007, E*Trade revoked the brand name license from SBI E*Trade Securities in Japan.[12]
In March 2008, E*Trade named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E*Trade's board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal.[13]
In July 2008, E*Trade sold its Canadian division to Scotiabank for CAD$444 million, as part of a program to stabilize the company.[14]
In December 2009, Robert Druskin, a former chief operating officer of Citigroup Inc. was named interim CEO and chairman.[15]
On March 22, 2010, Steven Freiberg, former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of the bank's credit card unit, was named as E*Trade's new CEO while Druskin continued in his role as board chairman. The company also announced it would seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.[16]
On January 17, 2013, Paul T. Idzik was appointed CEO. Idzik had previously been Group Chief Executive of DTZ and also served ten years at Barclays bank.[17]
On September 12, 2016, E*Trade acquired the parent company of OptionsHouse for $725 million and Karl A. Roessner was appointed CEO.[18]
Advertising[edit]
"E*Trade Baby" advertising campaign[edit]
E*Trade Baby was an integrated advertising campaign that appeared in online, television, print, and social media.
The first E*Trade baby was Gregory Michael Miller, taken in March 2001.[19]
In January 2008, E*Trade debuted advertisements during the Super Bowl featuring a talking baby in front of a web cam discussing investing and finance in an adult voice.
The "insufferable brat" returned the following year for Super Bowl XLVII, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube.[20] It is a 30-second "Talking Baby" advertisement. The E*Trade Baby demonstrates a "Save It" initiative that focuses on just how much money is at stake in hidden 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: "come to E*TRADE, and Save It".[21]
The E*Trade baby was voiced by comedian Pete Holmes.
The campaign was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group.[22] At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work.[23]
In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called “Enzo the Tailor,” in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany.[24]
In 2013, the company had over 64 million total views and over 26,000 subscribers on YouTube, more than 108,000 Facebook Baby and Corporate pages fans, and more than 17,000 Twitter followers.[25]
On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*Trade baby via a commercial which aired during March Madness.[26]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
