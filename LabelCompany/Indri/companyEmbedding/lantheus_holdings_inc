For the quarter, the company reported revenues of $81,359,000 against $76,474,000 a year ago. Operating income was $11,927,000 against $17,673,000 a year ago. Income before income taxes was $4,923,000 against $10,713,000 a year ago. Net income was $4,138,000 against $10,323,000 a year ago. Basic and diluted net income per common share was $0.11 against $0.34 a year ago. Adjusted operating income was $16,341,000 against $11,845,000 a year ago.

Style Scores:

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

					Full Description



Lantheus Holdings, Inc., incorporated on November 30, 2007, is engaged in the development, manufacture and commercialization of diagnostic medical imaging agents and products that assist clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases. Its imaging agents and products are used across a range of imaging modalities, including echocardiography and nuclear imaging. It operates in two segments: U.S. Segment and International Segment. The U.S. Segment produces and markets its medical imaging agents and products throughout the United States. In the United States, it sells its products to radiopharmacies, integrated delivery networks, hospitals, clinics and group practices. The International Segment operations consist of production and distribution activities in Puerto Rico and direct distribution activities in Canada. Additionally, within its International Segment, it has established and maintained third-party distribution relationships, under which its products are marketed and sold in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Its portfolio of nine commercial products is diversified across a range of imaging modalities. Its products include an ultrasound contrast agent and medical radiopharmaceuticals (including technetium generators).DEFINITYThe Company's DEFINITY is an ultrasound contrast imaging agent, which is indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. DEFINITY is a clear, colorless, sterile liquid, which, upon activation in a Vialmix apparatus, a medical device specifically designed for DEFINITY, becomes a homogenous, opaque, milky white injectable suspension of perflutren-containing lipid microspheres. After activation and intravenous injection, DEFINITY manages the ultrasound delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border, or the innermost layer of tissue that lines the chamber of the left ventricle. DEFINITY offers flexible dosing and administration through an IV bolus injection or continuous IV infusion. It is marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany, among others.TechneLiteTechneLite is a self-contained system or generator of Technetium (Tc99m), a radioactive isotope with a six hour half-life, used by radiopharmacies to prepare various nuclear imaging agents. Technetium results from the radioactive decay of Molybdenum-99 (Moly) itself, a radioisotope with a 66-hour half-life produced in nuclear research reactors around the world from enriched uranium. The TechneLite generator houses a vertical glass column at its core that contains Moly. The technetium produced by its TechneLite generator is the medical radioisotope that can be attached to a number of imaging agents, including its Cardiolite products and Neurolite, during the radiolabeling process.To radiolabel a technetium-based radiopharmaceutical, a vial of sterile saline and a vacuum vial are each affixed to the top of a TechneLite generator. The sterile saline is pulled through the generator, where it attracts technetium resulting from the radioactive decay of Moly within the generator column. The technetium-containing radioactive saline is then pulled into the vacuum vial and subsequently combined by a radiopharmacist with the applicable imaging agent, and individual patient-specific radiolabeled imaging agent doses are then prepared. When administered, the imaging agent binds to specific tissues or organs for a period of time, enabling the technetium to illustrate the functional health of the imaged tissues or organs in a diagnostic image. TechneLite was produced in 13 sizes and marketed primarily in North America and Latin America, as of December 31, 2016, to radiopharmacies that prepare unit doses of radiopharmaceutical imaging agents and that ship these preparations directly to hospitals for administration to patients. Its marketed in the United States, Canada, Caribbean Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica and Taiwan, among others.Xenon Xe 133 GasXenon Xe 133 Gas is a radiopharmaceutical gas that is inhaled and used to assess pulmonary function and also to image cerebral blood flow. Xenon is manufactured by a third party as a bi-product of Moly production and is processed and finished by the Company. It is marketed in the United States and Taiwan.Other Commercial ProductsNeurolite is an injectable, technetium-labeled imaging agent used with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technology to identify the area within the brain where blood flow has been blocked or reduced due to stroke. It is marketed in the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Thailand and Europe (excluding Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden), among others.Cardiolite, also known by its generic name, sestamibi, is an injectable, technetium-labeled imaging agent used in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) procedures to assess blood flow to the muscle of the heart using SPECT. Its marketed in the United States, Canada, Cost Rica, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Panama, and the Philippines.Thallium Tl 201 is an injectable radiopharmaceutical imaging agent used in MPI studies to detect cardiovascular disease. Its marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Pakistan, Panama and Taiwan.FDG is an injectable, fluorine-18-radiolabeled imaging agent used with positron emission tomography (PET) technology to identify and characterize tumors in patients undergoing oncologic diagnostic procedures. It manufactures and distributes FDG from its Puerto Rico radiopharmacy.Gallium Ga 67 is an injectable radiopharmaceutical imaging agent used to detect certain infections and cancerous tumors, especially lymphoma. It manufactures Gallium Ga 67 using cyclotron technology. It is marketed in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Pakistan, Australia, Costa Rica, South Korea, Panama, Taiwan and New Zealand.Quadramet, a therapeutic product, is an injectable radiopharmaceutical used to treat severe bone pain associated with metastatic bone lesions.
