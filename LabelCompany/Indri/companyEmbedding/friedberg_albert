  About Friedberg  
  Office Locations  





About the Friedberg Mercantile Group Ltd.
Friedberg Mercantile Group Ltd. ("Friedberg") is a broker dealer that is a member of IIROC, CIPF and all Canadian exchanges. Friedberg provides a wide range of financial and investment services to retail and institutional clients. Friedberg is a family-owned company and it is the policy of the Friedberg family to be the lead investor in any investment product offered by the company. Throughout its history, Friedberg has specialized in managing money in non-traditional asset classes. Clients who prefer not to have their investments fully-managed, are provided with the same brokerage services that Friedberg utilizes for its managed investments. Friedberg is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.
Friedberg  has ...AN UNCONVENTIONAL VIEW OF GLOBAL ECONOMICS
To assist in detecting new, long-term trends that result in trading and investment opportunities, Friedberg relies, in large part, on a body of economic theory developed since 1870 by members of the Austrian School of Economics. This economic theory holds that policy changes which allow markets to operate freely result in economic growth and wealth creation. Interventionist policies, on the other hand, are not market friendly and result in economic stagnation and the decline of wealth. Profit opportunities exist when these changes are anticipated and interpreted properly. By applying the basic lessons of Austrian economics, Friedberg has been able to identify opportunities before most market participants and, as a result, generate substantial profits for its clients.

Overview


Description
 For courses in Advanced Linear Algebra.
This top-selling, theorem-proof text presents a careful treatment of the principal topics of linear algebra, and illustrates the power of the subject through a variety of applications. It emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between linear transformations and matrices, but states theorems in the more general infinite-dimensional case where appropriate.














Features
 NEW - Added section on the singular value decomposition.    Discusses the pseudoinverse of a matrix or a linear transformation between finite-dimensional inner product spaces.    
 NEW - Revised proofs, added examples and exercises.    Improves the clarity of the text and enhances students' understanding of it.    
  The friendliest treatment of rigor in linear algebra—Usually used for a 2nd course, but can be used for smart, fast students in first course. 
  Numerous accessible exercises—Enriches and extends the text material.  Offers students a chance to test their understanding by working interesting problems at a reasonable level of difficulty.    
  Real-world applications throughout.    Reveals to students the power of the subject by demonstrating its practical uses.

Overview



The TaRYaG count-the traditional enumeration of the 613 commandments contained in the five Mosaic books (Torah)-holds a prominent place in Jewish thought. The tradition is based on an aggadah found in the Babylonian Talmud and, with some variants, in Midrash Tanhuma. No one did more to see this count achieve its place of importance than Moses Maimonides, who, in his Sefer ha-Mitsvot, methodically crafted a list with the intent of having it serve as an outline for his upcoming Mishneh Torah, the most comprehensive code of law in Jewish history. In the first half of this work, Friedberg investigates Maimonides' methods and reasoning and arrives at a new and innovative reason for his interest in the TaRYaG count. Friedberg then continues, carefully examining the language used for presenting commandments in the Mishneh Torah, which suggests to him new dimensions in Maimonides' legal theory.
