History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Executive history[edit]
In March 2016, Bob Hugin, the company's long serving CEO, retired his position and took the role of executive chairman.[18] Bob Hugin was succeeded in the CEO role by Mark Alles.[18] At the same time, Jacqualyn Fouse was named as the company's president and COO; Fouse had joined the company in 2010 as the CFO.[18] Effective June 30, 2017, Dr. Fouse will purportedly step down and be succeeded by Scott Smith, president of the company's Global Inflammation & Immunology Franchise, who joined the company in 2008.[18]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Executive history[edit]
In March 2016, Bob Hugin, the company's long serving CEO, retired his position and took the role of executive chairman.[18] Bob Hugin was succeeded in the CEO role by Mark Alles.[18] At the same time, Jacqualyn Fouse was named as the company's president and COO; Fouse had joined the company in 2010 as the CFO.[18] Effective June 30, 2017, Dr. Fouse will purportedly step down and be succeeded by Scott Smith, president of the company's Global Inflammation & Immunology Franchise, who joined the company in 2008.[18]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary  Celgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively "we," "our," "us," "Celgene" or the "Company"), is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Celgene Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986.  Our primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID(R), POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R), OTEZLA(R), ABRAXANE(R), VIDAZA(R), azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA(R)) and THALOMID(R) (sold as THALOMID(R) or Thalidomide Celgene(R) outside of the U.S.). In addition, we earn revenue from other product sales and licensing arrangements.  We continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. Our clinical trial activity includes trials across the disease areas of hematology, solid tumors, and inflammation and immunology. REVLIMID(R) is in several phase III trials covering a range of hematological malignancies that include multiple myeloma, lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In solid tumors, ABRAXANE(R) is currently in various stages of investigation for breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. In inflammation and immunology, OTEZLA(R) is being evaluated in phase III trials for Beh�et's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. We also have a growing number of potential products in phase III trials across multiple diseases. In the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area, we have phase III trials underway for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and for GED-0301 (mongersen) in Crohn's disease. In hematology, phase III trials are underway for CC-486 and luspatercept in MDS, for CC-486 and enasidenib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for luspatercept in beta-thalassemia. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted a new drug application (NDA) for enasidenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.  Beyond our phase III programs, we have access to a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel potential therapies to address significant unmet medical needs that consists of new drug candidates and cell therapies developed in-house, licensed from other companies or able to be optioned from collaboration partners. We believe that continued use of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, potential regulatory approvals of new products and new indications for existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.  The following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):   % Change Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 versus versus 2016 2015 2014 2015 2014 Total revenue $ 11,229.2 $ 9,256.0 $ 7,670.4 21.3 % 20.7 % Net income $ 1,999.2 $ 1,602.0 $ 1,999.9 24.8 % (19.9 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 2.49 $ 1.94 $ 2.39 28.4 % (18.8 )%  Revenue increased by $1.973 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID(R), OTEZLA(R), and POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R). The $397.2 million increase in net income and $0.55 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2016 as compared to 2015 were primarily due to a higher level of net product sales and a $601.9 million reduction in collaboration-related expenses, partly offset by increases in other expenses, including $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab AG (EngMab), Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Acetylon), and Triphase Research and Development I Corporation (Triphase), $345.3 million of increased impairment charges related to strategic equity investments, which included $272.2 million related to our equity investment in Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno), an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $198.5 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense, and an $83.1 million impairment charge related to the technology platform obtained in our 2012 acquisition of Avila Therapeutics, Inc. (Avila).  Results of Operations   % Change 2016 2015 versus versus 2016 2015 2014 2015 2014 Net product sales: REVLIMID� $ 6,973.6 $ 5,801.1 $ 4,980.0 20.2 % 16.5 % POMALYST�/IMNOVID� 1,310.7 983.3 679.7 33.3 % 44.7 % OTEZLA� 1,017.2 471.7 69.8 115.6 % N/M ABRAXANE� 973.4 967.5 848.2 0.6 % 14.1 % VIDAZA� 608.0 590.7 611.9 2.9 % (3.5 )% azacitidine for injection 66.0 83.9 78.2 (21.3 )% 7.3 % THALOMID� 152.1 185.4 221.2 (18.0 )% (16.2 )% ISTODAX� 79.3 69.1 65.6 14.8 % 5.3 % Other 4.3 8.4 9.2 (48.8 )% (8.7 )% Total net product sales $ 11,184.6 $ 9,161.1 $ 7,563.8 22.1 % 21.1 % Other revenue 44.6 94.9 106.6 (53.0 )% (11.0 )% Total revenue $ 11,229.2 $ 9,256.0 $ 7,670.4 21.3 % 20.7 %  N/M - Not meaningful  contributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R). Achieving reimbursement in additional countries, notably in Japan, also continues to contribute to the growth of POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R) net sales in international markets.  Net sales of POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R) increased by $303.6 million, or 44.7%, to $983.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $591.8 million in the United States and $391.5 million in international markets. Increases in market share and treatment duration contributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R).  OTEZLA(R) net sales increased by $545.5 million to $1.017 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $904.4 million in the United States and $112.8 million in international markets. 2016 was the second full year on the market in the U.S. Growth in the U.S. reflects increased market share and expanding accessibility to patients. Sales in international markets continued to expand during 2016, with growing sales in early launch countries in Europe and additional international approvals.  Net sales of OTEZLA(R) increased by $401.9 million to $471.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $440.0 million in the United States and $31.7 million in international markets. OTEZLA(R) net sales were $69.8 million for 2014, primarily from sales in the United States. OTEZLA(R) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. OTEZLA(R) was approved for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the EU in January 2015. Launch activities for OTEZLA(R) commenced in March 2014 and we began recognizing revenue related to OTEZLA(R) during the second quarter of 2014.  ABRAXANE(R) net sales increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6% to $973.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. U.S. sales of $633.8 million and international sales of $339.6 million decreased 3.0 percent and increased 8.2 percent, respectively. The increase in international sales was primarily due to increased unit sales, which were partially offset by price decreases. The decrease in U.S. sales was due to volume decreases partly offset by price increases. The decrease in U.S. sales reflects the increased competition in breast cancer and lung cancer indications from new market entrants.  Net sales of ABRAXANE(R) increased by $119.3 million, or 14.1%, to $967.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit volumes in both the U.S. and international markets reflecting increased acceptance of the product for the treatment of both metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ABRAXANE(R) was approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as first-line treatment in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy in the European Union in March 2015.  VIDAZA(R) net sales increased by $17.3 million, or 2.9%, to $608.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $26.6 million increase in international markets resulting from increased unit sales which were partly offset by price decreases in international markets and both volume and price decreases in the U.S. market.  Azacitidine for injection net sales increased by $5.7 million, or 7.3%, to $83.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales to Sandoz, which were partly offset by price decreases.  THALOMID(R) net sales decreased by $33.3 million, or 18.0%, to $152.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes in the U.S.  Net sales of THALOMID(R) decreased by $35.8 million, or 16.2%, to $185.4 million for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes and price decreases in both U.S. and international markets.  ISTODAX(R) net sales increased by $10.2 million, or 14.8%, to $79.3 million for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in unit volume as well as price increases.  The "other" net product sales category, which includes sales of FOCALIN(R), decreased by $4.1 million, to $4.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The "other" net product sales category decreased by $0.8 million to $8.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014.  Other revenue decreased by $11.7 million to $94.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $14.1 million decrease in royalty revenue. The decrease in royalty revenue was driven by lower royalties earned from Novartis based on its sales of FOCALIN XR(R) and RITALIN(R), which have both been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets.  Gross to Net Sales Accruals: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, chargebacks and distributor service fees.  REVLIMID(R), POMALYST(R) and THALOMID(R) are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), POMALYST REMS(R) and THALOMID REMS(R) programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID(R), POMALYST(R) and THALOMID(R). Internationally, REVLIMID(R), THALOMID(R)/Thalidomide Celgene(R) and IMNOVID(R) are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the product's safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. OTEZLA(R), ABRAXANE(R), ISTODAX(R) and VIDAZA(R) are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID(R), POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R) and THALOMID(R)/Thalidomide Celgene(R).  We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID(R), POMALYST(R)/IMNOVID(R) and THALOMID(R)/Thalidomide Celgene(R) are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.  Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.  Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-sponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.  Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.  Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.  See Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.  Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):   Chargebacks Government and Distributor Sales Returns Discounts Rebates Service Fees Total Balance at December 31, 2013 $ 15.5 $ 12.1 $ 134.1 $ 83.2 $ 244.9 Allowances for sales during prior periods (5.4 ) - (7.1 ) (8.4 ) (20.9 ) Allowances for sales during 2014 7.9 87.9 293.1 382.9 771.8 Credits/deductions issued for prior year sales (4.1 ) (8.8 ) (78.8 ) (43.3 ) (135.0 ) Credits/deductions issued for sales during 2014 (3.7 ) (79.7 ) (202.8 ) (320.0 ) (606.2 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 10.2 $ 11.5 $ 138.5 $ 94.4 $ 254.6 Allowances for sales during prior periods 1.0 - (5.1 ) (3.0 ) (7.1 ) Allowances for sales during 2015 15.3 111.7 423.5 541.6 1,092.1 Credits/deductions issued for prior year sales (3.9 ) (8.2 ) (77.7 ) (50.6 ) (140.4 ) Credits/deductions issued for sales during 2015 (5.2 ) (102.8 ) (254.1 ) (440.7 ) (802.8 ) Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 17.4 $ 12.2 $ 225.1 $ 141.7 $ 396.4 Allowances for sales during prior periods (6.6 ) - 19.9 (13.4 ) (0.1 ) Allowances for sales during 2016 17.3 153.5 667.8 763.8 1,602.4 Credits/deductions issued for prior year sales (6.6 ) (10.4 ) (174.9 ) (56.0 ) (247.9 ) Credits/deductions issued for sales during 2016 (3.8 ) (139.4 ) (366.7 ) (646.3 ) (1,156.2 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 17.7 $ 15.9 $ 371.2 $ 189.8 $ 594.6  A comparison of provisions for allowances for sales within each of the four categories noted above for 2016 and 2015 follows:  Discount provisions increased by $41.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $41.8 million increase consisted of a $37.7 million increase in the United States and a $4.1 million increase related to international markets. The U.S. increases included increases of $21.0 million for cash discounts related to REVLIMID(R), $12.8 million related to OTEZLA(R) and $4.3 million related to POMALYST(R).  Government rebate provisions increased by $269.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $120.8 million increase in international government rebates. The increase in international government rebates was primarily driven by higher sales volumes for our primary products in Europe and increased international rebate rates, as well as an adjustment of our accrual to reflect higher rebate rates for IMNOVID(R) in France. The increase in the allowance for sales of IMNOVID(R) in France related to prior periods was $15.1 million and the increase for sales of IMNOVID(R) in the current year due to higher rebate rates in France was $23.2 million. The $148.5 million increase in the U.S. market was primarily due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, with $107.7 million due to an increase in Medicaid rebates (primarily in the managed care channel) and $40.8 million due to an increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.  Chargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $211.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Chargebacks increased by approximately $140.4 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $71.4 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes, including an $11.4 million increase related to the TRICARE program driven by higher sales volume and increased rebate rates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA(R), which accounted for $64.1 million of the increase in distributor service fees.  2015 compared to 2014: Provisions for sales returns increased by $13.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in ABRAXANE(R) returns reserve allowance related to inventory levels held by certain distributors at the end of 2015. Higher net product sales volumes and elevated returns activity in the U.S. market also resulted in $6.0 million of increases in 2015. In addition, $4.8 million of reductions in returns reserves were recorded in 2014 for the migration of THALOMID(R) to specialty pharmacies and for VIDAZA(R) inventory levels held at distributors following competition from generic versions of VIDAZA(R). These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to POMALYST(R) in 2015 due to lower returns activity.  Discount provisions increased by $23.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $23.8 million increase consisted of a $24.3 million increase in the United States, which included increases of $13.4 million of cash discounts related to REVLIMID(R), $8.9 million related to OTEZLA(R) and $3.0 million related to POMALYST(R). The U.S. increases were partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease related to international cash discounts.  Government rebate provisions increased by $132.4 million in 2015 compared to . . .

BeiGene stock surges 12% on Celgene cancer collaboration
BeiGene Ltd.  shares surged 12.6% in premarket trade Thursday on news of its cancer collaboration with Celgene Corp. . BeiGene will receive $263 million in upfront licensing fees, and is eligible for up to $980 million in milestone payments and royalties, the companies said, and Celgene will acquire 5.9% of BeiGene's shares at $59.55. BeiGene shares closed at $52.27 on Wednesday. Under the deal, the companies will work to develop and commercialize BeiGene's cancer drug BGB-A317 in solid tumor cancers in much of the world (except Asia but including Japan), while BeiGene will retain development and commercialization rights for the drug in some other areas. BeiGene will also acquire Celgene's China commercial operations and exclusively license Celgene drugs that have been approved in China. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Celgene shares have surged 7.2% over the last three months and BeiGene shares have surged 41.2%, compared with a 3.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Juno Therapeutics stock drops 5% after BTIG downgrades to sell
Juno Therapeutics Inc.  shares dropped 5.2% in premarket trade Thursday after BTIG downgraded it to sell from neutral, with a $12 price target. Juno shares closed at $23.73 on Wednesday. The company is "trailing" competitors like Kite Pharma Inc.  and Novartis AG  to market and there is "little demonstrative proof" that Juno drugs work better or have fewer life-threatening side effects, BTIG analyst Dane Leone said. The company's lack of progress casts questions about its management, Leone said, who also criticized Juno Chief Executive Hans Bishop. "We do not think the impetus is currently in place (activism) but the company has built out a CAR T infrastructure with backing from Celgene  which could be valuable if managed correctly," he said. Not all analysts agree with Leone's poor assessment of Juno: Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said on Wednesday that "we think the JUNO weakness on competitive fears is unwarranted and believe JUNO's JCAR017 product looks very competitive to both NVS' and KITE's data... when compared apples to apples." More time is needed to compare the products, he said, with Juno on track to start a pivotal study in the second half of this year. After several patients in a clinical trial for Juno's JCAR015 drug died last year, the company later announced it would discontinue the drug's development. Juno and other companies are developing a similar type of cancer treatment, but rivals have garnered more positive results. Recent clinical trial results from rival Bluebird Bio  prompted a J.P. Morgan analyst to christen the company "the clear winner" at a major cancer conference this past weekend. Juno shares have risen 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 3% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Bluebird Bio stock rises 7.4% on positive data from ongoing early-stage clinical trial
Bluebird Bio Inc.  shares rose 7.4% in heavy morning trade Monday after the company released updated results from an ongoing early-stage clinical trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Relapsed multiple myeloma refers to when the cancer returns after treatment, while refractory multiple myeloma means the cancer isn't responding to treatment. The drug, bb2121, which is being jointly developed by Bluebird Bio and Celgene Corp. , had a 100% overall response rate in three of four groups of dosed patients, with the other group having an overall response rate of 33%. The 31 patients who were enrolled in the trial as of early May (the company plans to enroll up to 50 patients total) got several types of treatment prior to bb2121, with a median of 7 lines of prior therapy, with the range varying between three and 14 lines of therapy, the company said. None of the patients in the active dose groups saw the cancer progress, said Celgene's  Michael Pehl, president, hematology and oncology. "The consistency, depth and durability of these patients' responses coupled with a manageable safety profile is very exciting, and we believe will provide hope for patients in this setting," Pehl said. "The efficacy and safety profile of bb2121 continues to look very strong," said Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt. "We believe these data position BLUE (and partner CELG [MP]) well among companies developing CAR-T products in multiple myeloma and provide additional validation for bb2121 and BLUE's emerging CAR-T platform," referring to CAR-T cell therapy, a type of cancer immunotherapy that uses a patient's blood cells to fight cancer. Bluebird Bio shares have risen 7% to $91.45 over the last three months, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Bluebird Bio stock jumps 7% after Maxim Group upgrades to buy
Bluebird Bio Inc.  shares jumped 7.3% in premarket trade Friday after the company was upgraded to buy from hold at Maxim Group, with a price target of $100, above the company's $79.20 share price as of Thursday's close. The American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, which begins Friday and runs through Tuesday, could be a big opportunity for the company's shares, with the company scheduled to present data on multiple myeloma, said Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert. Kolbert said he believes positive data from December for Bluebird Bio's bb2121 -- which is being developed in partnership with Celgene Corp.  -- along with positive results for the same type of cancer approach in May from another biotech company, "increase the probability for positive data for bb2121 at ASCO." Bluebird Bio is scheduled to present safety and efficacy data from a trial enrolling 18 patients on Monday, with the results including one-year follow-up data for the first nine patients. Bluebird Bio shares have dropped 9% over the last three months, compared with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Why Celgene Corp Is a Better Buy Than Gilead Sciences
Celgene's current products and its R&D pipeline could make it a better investment than Gilead Sciences.











                Todd Campbell
            

                (TMFEBCapital)



            
            Nov 3, 2016 at 3:41PM

Over the past five years, there have perhaps been no large-cap biotech companies that have been as successful as Celgene Corp. (NASDAQ:CELG) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). New drug launches have resulted in sales and profit surging higher at both companies. However, Gilead Sciences has been stumbling lately, and after reviewing the two companies' products and pipelines, I think it's Celgene that offers investors the best shot at future growth.
Better product portfolio
Undeniably, both companies have proven they know how to develop and commercialize top-selling medications. Celgene is the market-leading maker of multiple myeloma drugs, and Gilead Sciences dominates the market for both HIV and hepatitis C treatment.
Celgene's Revlimid is the most prescribed first- and second-line multiple myeloma drug, and Pomalyst is rapidly winning market share in the third-line setting. Last quarter, Revlimid's sales grew 30% to $1.9 billion versus a year ago, while Pomalyst's sales grew 33% to $341 million year over year.
Gilead Sciences' HIV and HCV drugs capture more than 80% of their respective markets. A new, safer formulation of the popular HIV drug Viread, marketed under the brand name TAF, is reinvigorating HIV revenue. And the company's oral hepatitis C drugs have transformed treatment in the indication, resulting in Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C sales exiting 2015 at a formidable $5 billion quarterly clip. 
Both companies deserve kudos for those successes, but Celgene's first foray into autoimmune disease has gone far better than Gilead Sciences' first foray into oncology, and that's allowing Celgene to post top- and bottom-line growth while Gilead Sciences' sales slip.
Celgene notched FDA approval of Otezla for psoriasis in 2014, and ever since, the drug's prescription market share has been outpacing some of the best-selling drugs in the indication. Last year, Otezla's sales were $472 million, and this year, Otezla's sales reached an annualized $1.1 billion in the third quarter.

Overall, rising demand for Celgene's various drugs resulted in third quarter-sales that grew 28% from a year ago to $2.97 billion.
Celgene's success with Otezla is a stark contrast to Gilead Sciences' experience with Zydelig, a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. After winning approval in 2014, safety concerns have put a lid on Zydelig's sales. In Q3, Zydelig's revenue totaled only $39 million, a far cry from the billion-dollar blockbuster potential forecast by industry watchers when the drug launched.
Zydelig's failure is especially disappointing because its success could have helped soften the blow to Gilead Sciences' top line this year. Because of a decline in patient starts and increased competition, Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C sales are falling, and despite improving HIV sales, that caused Gilead Sciences' third-quarter sales to drop to $7.4 billion last quarter from $8.2 billion a year ago. Since the hepatitis C market is maturing, and competition in the indication remains fierce, there's little reason to think hepatitis C growth is will reaccelerate soon.

Better pipeline
Not only do I think Celgene has a more compelling product lineup now, I also think it's got a better shot at delivering wins from its R&D pipeline over the next few years.
Celgene has invested heavily in collaborations with some of biotech's most intriguing companies, and it appears those investments are about to pay off. Celgene expects to submit an application to the FDA for approval of Agios' AG-221, a therapy for relapsing/recurring acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, before the end of this year. If approved, AG-221 could have nine figure sales potential.
Next year, results should be available for the company's ozanimod in multiple sclerosis, and if those results are solid, Celgene has a shot at having the best-in-class oral MS therapy in a $19 billion market. Ozanimod is being evaluated in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, too.
Celgene's GED-0301 for Crohn's disease is in registration enabling studies that, if successful, could lead to data in 2018 and commercialization in 2019. Celgene and Juno Therapeutics' CAR-T therapy, JCAR015, could also make its way to regulators over the coming year.
Overall, Celgene will get data from 19 phase 3 studies, including label expansion trials, and data on more than 20 mid-stage programs through 2018. It also expects to file 15 (or more) new drugs with the FDA for investigation. 
Celgene's flurry of R&D activity is impressive, but to be fair, Gilead Sciences' isn't sitting on its hands. One of Gilead Sciences most interesting drugs is filgotinib, which is being developed with collaboration partner Galapagos. Filgotinib is being evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease; however, those trials just recently began, which means it will be a while before we have data to parse.
Gilead Sciences also has GS-5745 in phase 3 as a treatment for gastric cancer that's interesting, and a bit further back, Gilead is developing a slate of drugs for non-alcoholic steteohepatitis, or NASH. NASH is increasingly the cause of liver transplant; however, industrywide R&D in the indication suggests this could be a competitive market. It may also be tricky convincing payers to pay up for widespread use of NASH therapies without pre-authorization hurdles. Therefore, I think Gilead Sciences' NASH research is a bet with a high payoff in a relatively new, and risky, indication.





Looking forward
Gilead Sciences is guiding for a full-year sales decline this year, and I don't see a lot on the horizon that could move its top line up meaningfully in 2017. Meanwhile, Celgene is targeting solid double-digit sales and profit growth this year, and in Celgene's Q3 conference call, management said it's on track to deliver at the high end of its 2017 forecast for $12.7 billion to $13 billion in sales and $6.75 to $7 in EPS.
In the past, Celgene has also offered up compelling long-range sales and earnings targets. The company's management believes it can deliver $21 billion in sales and $13 in EPS in 2020. That forecast calls for some skepticism, but given all of Celgene's R&D activity, it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up hitting its target.

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Executive history[edit]
In March 2016, Bob Hugin, the company's long serving CEO, retired his position and took the role of executive chairman.[18] Bob Hugin was succeeded in the CEO role by Mark Alles.[18] At the same time, Jacqualyn Fouse was named as the company's president and COO; Fouse had joined the company in 2010 as the CFO.[18] Effective June 30, 2017, Dr. Fouse will purportedly step down and be succeeded by Scott Smith, president of the company's Global Inflammation & Immunology Franchise, who joined the company in 2008.[18]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Executive history[edit]
In March 2016, Bob Hugin, the company's long serving CEO, retired his position and took the role of executive chairman.[18] Bob Hugin was succeeded in the CEO role by Mark Alles.[18] At the same time, Jacqualyn Fouse was named as the company's president and COO; Fouse had joined the company in 2010 as the CFO.[18] Effective June 30, 2017, Dr. Fouse will purportedly step down and be succeeded by Scott Smith, president of the company's Global Inflammation & Immunology Franchise, who joined the company in 2008.[18]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
