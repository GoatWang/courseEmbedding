Should You Expect AdCare Health Systems Inc (ADK) To Continue Delivering An ROE Of 26.5%?



Andrew Carroll 


            				July 5, 2017			        


 AdCare Health Systems Inc (AMEX:ADK), with its ROE of 26.5 over the past 12 months, performed better than the industry, which averaged 15.28% in the same period. However, investors, focused only on Return on Equity, often ignore the rising interest costs which result in actual return to be significantly lower. Thus, we must look at how a company’s debt profile changed during the same time period. See our latest analysis for ADK 
Breaking down ROE — the mother of all ratios
 ROE is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company. The ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominator.Any ROE north of 20%, implying 20 cents return on every dollar invested, is favourable for any investor. But investors seek multiple assets to diversify risk and an industry-specific comparison makes more sense to achieve the goal of choosing the best among a given lot.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 No matter how high or low return a company generates on equity, it should be more than the cost of equity for value creation. For ADK, the cost of equity estimate comes at 16.9% based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the current risk free rate and a levered beta to account for financial leverage. That compares to AdCare Health Systems’s 26.5% ROE.


 AdCare Health Systems (AMEX:ADK) Last Perf Jul 5th 17
 
                         When we break down ROE using a very popular method called Dupont Formula, it unfolds into three key ratios which are responsible for a company’s profitability: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. While higher margin and asset turnover indicate improved efficiency, investors should be cautious about the impact of increased leverage.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 A reflection of how net profit margin has affected ROE in the past can be seen in the trend of income and revenue. An investor can gauge a fair estimate of how it’s going to play out in the future by looking at the analysts’ forecasts in the years ahead.AdCare Health Systems’s ROA over the past 12 months stood at 2.5% versus the industry’s 6.24%. Although an investor should look at multi-year asset turnover to assess its effect on the latest ROE, a quick comparison with the industry tells him whether it’s acceptable. We use ROA for the comparison as along with sales, used in asset turnover, earnings, used in ROA, are also comparable within the industry.
 

 AdCare Health Systems (AMEX:ADK) Historical Debt Jul 5th 17
 
 The impact of leverage on ROE is reflected in a company’s debt-equity profile. Rapidly rising debt compared to equity, while profit margin and asset turnover underperform, raises a red flag on the ROE. It’s important as a company can inflate its ROE by consistently increasing debt despite weak operating performance. ADK’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 3.47. Investors should be cautious about any sharp change in this ratio, more so if it’s due to increasing debt.
Why is ROE called the mother of all ratios
 While ROE can be calculated through a very simple calculation, investors should look at various ratios by breaking it down and how each of them affects the return to understand the strengths and weakness of a company. It’s one of the few ratios which stitches together performance metrics from the income statement and the balance sheet. What are the analysts’ projection of AdCare Health Systems’s ROE in three years? I recommend you see our latest FREE analysis report to find out!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
