Arc Logistics IPO Is A Wait And See | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Arc Logistics IPO Is A Wait And SeeNov.  5, 2013  1:10 PM ETby: Don DionDon Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsArc Logistics Partners LP (NYSE:ARCX), a New York, New York-based limited partnership formed by Lightfoot Capital Partners to own, operate, develop, and acquire complementary energy logistics assets, plans to raise $120 million in its upcoming IPO. The firm will offer 6 million shares at an expected price range of $19-$21 per share. At the midpoint of that range at $20 per share, ARCX will command a market value of $234 million. See S-1
ARCX filed on October 2, 2013.Lead Underwriters: Barclays Capital Inc, Citigroup Global Markets IncUnderwriters: Global Hunter Securities LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC, Robert W. Baird & Co Inc, Stifel Nicolaus & Co Inc, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
SummaryARCX is a fee-based LP formed by Lightfoot to handle logistics needs. The firm is primarily focused on the terminalling, storage, throughput and transloading of crude oil and petroleum products. The firm's business model surrounds the development and acquisition of terminalling, storage, rail, pipeline and other logistics assets that generate stable cash flows, allowing it to pay increasing quarterly cash distributions to unitholders.
ARCX's initial asset base will include 14 terminals in nine states spread across the East Coast, Gulf Coast and Midwest. These terminals will have approximately 5.0 million barrels of storage capacity. ARCX's initial assets will also include two rail transloading facilities near Mobile and an interest in Gulf LNG Holdings.
ValuationARCX offers the following figures in its S-1 balance sheet for the six months ending June 30, 2013:
Revenue: $22,703,981Net Income: $11,195,753Total Assets: $263,222,752Total Liabilities: $124,830,447Stockholders' Equity: $107,792,305
ARCX will offer a quarterly distribution of $0.3875 per unit, annualized to $1.55 per unit. Assuming the IPO prices at the midpoint of the expected price range at $20, the distributions would generate an annual yield of 7.5%.
Use of ProceedsARCX intends to use some of the proceeds from this IPO to purchase a 10.3% LLC interest in Gulf LNG Holdings, which owns a liquefied natural gas regasification and storage facility in Pscagoula, MS.

ManagementARCX is managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of its general partner, Arc Logistics GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of its sponsor, Lightfoot.
Chairman and CEO Vincent T. Cubbage has served in his positions with ARCX's general partner since September 2013. He has served as CEO of Lightfoot Capital Partners GP LLC since 2006, and has an ownership interest in the company. Mr. Cubbage previously served as a Senior Managing Director and Head of the Midstream and Coal sectors in the Investment Banking Division of Banc of America Securities and as a Vice President at Salomon Smith Barney in the Global Energy and Power Group. Mr. Cubbage received an MBA from the American Graduate School of International Management and a BA from Eastern Washington University.
Competition
ARCX competes with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies. These include companies like Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMP), Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) that have more capital and resources.
ConclusionWe are not recommending ARCX at the current proposed range of $19 to $21. We would reconsider the offering if it prices in the $16 to $18 range which we believe is a possibility.
The firm is offering a very healthy yield and seems to have the means to pay them; for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013, ARCX generated sufficient cash available for distribution to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all of its common units. The firm is profitable and benefits from the stability and clout associated with the backing from Lightfoot, along with a highly experienced management team familiar with Lightfoot's operations.
ARCX has continued to expand its assets aggressively, and we wouldn't be surprised to see unitholders getting larger distributions in years to come.
