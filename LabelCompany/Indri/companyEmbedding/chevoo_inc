Introducing CHEVOO, a one-of-a-kind artisan goat cheese. The unique combination of hand-blended chèvre immersed in an olive oil infusion. 




 






An Infusion of HappinessCHEVOO is an artisan cheese maker based in the wine country of Northern California.
CHEVOO is made from the highest quality goat curd, hand-blended with aromatic spices, herbs, pollens and chilis. It’s then paired with an extra virgin olive oil blend that has been infused with crushed botanicals for 8 weeks. This combination of flavors in both the chèvre and infused oil makes CHEVOO truly unique.
CHEVOO comes in three distinct varietals. Smoked Sea Salt & Rosemary. California Dill Pollen & Garlic. Aleppo-Urfa Chili & Lemon.
CHEVOO is for sharing. Entertaining friends and family. Impromptu get-togethers. Elegant dinner parties. Elevating home-cooked meals into something special.
CHEVOO is great with fresh artisanal bread. Or, stirred through steaming pasta. Melted on crusty pizza. Crumbled on garden salads. CHEVOO goes well with … life!
Share it with people you really, really like.

An accessible and fresh flavor reminiscent of the Pacific coast.California Dill Pollen & GarlicA taste of Northern California. Fresh chèvre hand-blended with locally harvested dill pollen, marinated in a light garlic-infused extra virgin olive oil blend. Subtle highlights that quietly echo the rolling hills of Wine Country.Aleppo-Urfa Chili & LemonVelvety chèvre hand-blended with Aleppo and Urfa chili peppers, marinated in a delicate lemon-infused extra virgin olive oil blend. A sophisticated mix of heat and citrus, with a hint of old world charm. 
























Our Story | Chevoo

































































 






The EVOO-lution of Cheese. 
CHEVOO was created by Gerard and Susan Tuck, two Aussies who moved to California with their three young children. Good food and laughter shared amongst friends and family has always been a central and important aspect of their laid-back, fun-loving lifestyle. Marinated goat cheese was a staple in their Aussie home for many years — a much loved ingredient for any barbecue, dinner party, or home-cooked meal. As passionate food lovers with a taste for adventure, they were inspired to create a new, unique range of marinated goat cheeses in the US, drawing on the abundant farm lands of Northern California.
CHEVOO is made from the highest quality goat curd, hand-blended with new and unique combinations of spices, herbs, chilis and pollens – then paired with an Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) that has been slowly infused with crushed  botanicals. The combination of flavor profiles in both the chèvre and infused oil makes CHEVOO quite delectable.
CHEVOO will sit proudly on any dinner table or kitchen counter, surrounded by friends who want to taste new creations, captured in a modern setting, with a respectful tip of the hat to old world traditions and ingredients.

Our idea of the perfect Sunday breakfast: Creamy scrambled eggs with CHEVOO’s Dill Pollen & Garlic, topped with smoked salmon, on rustic toast; Diced avocado with CHEVOO ‘s Aleppo-Urfa Chili & Lemon on toasted baguette; And a freshly brewed pour-over coffee. All shared with people we really, really like … of course!

Smoked Sea Salt and Rosemary Chevre


                Tags:
                
                Dairy and Eggs :: Cheese

Our most versatile flavor. A delicate chèvre hand-blended with smoked sea salt and cracked pepper, marinated in a rosemary-infused extra virgin olive oil blend. An accessible and fresh flavor reminiscent of the Pacific coast.

                    Date product entered market: Nov. 7, 2016
                

ABOUT THE PRODUCER



CHEVOO Inc.
                            Healdsburg, CA
                            707-731-4400


CHEVOO is made from the highest quality goat curd, hand-blended with aromatic spices, herbs, pollens and chilis. It’s then paired with an extra virgin olive oil blend that has been infused with crushed botanicals for 4 – 8 weeks. This combination of flavors in both the chèvre and infused oil makes CHEVOO truly unique.

CHEVOO comes in three distinct varietals. Smoked Sea Salt & Rosemary. California Dill Pollen & Garlic. Aleppo-Urfa Chili & Lemon.

CHEVOO is great with fresh artisanal bread. Or, stirred through steaming pasta. Melted on crusty pizza. Crumbled on garden salads. CHEVOO goes well with … life!

Operations manager
Chevoo Inc.
140 Grove Court, Suite A, Healdsburg, 95448

Notable Quote: “The work life balance is very challenging for those of us who choose to be a professional while raising a family. I overcome this by leveraging my friends and family to assist with raising my daughter, for I truly feel that ‘it takes a village.’ ”
Professional background: Lieutenant Junior Grade – United States Navy – Surface Warfare Officer; Quality Supervisor – Smuckers, Crystal Geyser, La Tortilla Factory
Education: Bachelor of Arts in general science, United States Naval Academy; Currently enrolled in Sonoma State University Executive Master’s of Business Administration program.
Staff: 7
Tell us about yourself and your company: I was hired as the Operations Manager for CHEVOO, Inc. shortly after the company was launched by Gerard and Susan Tuck in 2015. CHEVOO is a start-up food company which manufactures marinated goat cheese and has evolved rapidly over the past two years. Originally, CHEVOO was created in Oregon and my role was to oversee production aspects. In early 2016, the company decided to cease operations in Oregon and transition to Sonoma County. I advised the CEO to build a facility in Healdsburg, which would consolidate all facets of production and operations; the facility was completed in October of 2016 and will soon be co-packaging products for other companies in need of increased production capacity
Is there a major accomplishment in the past year or so that you would like to share?
My Quality Assurance background led CHEVOO to earning our (Safe Quality Food) SQF Level 3 Certification with a score of excellent, the highest level certification possible. This is an important milestone, because it puts CHEVOO at the ‘gold standard’ amongst food producers in the US; it is the highest standard that any retailer could expect, and is maintained by businesses such as Whole Foods, Costco, Kroger, and Safeway. Our co-packing clients could not ask for more; and most importantly, it means that we are doing everything in our power to produce only the safest and highest quality food for human consumption. Many companies will take a number of years to slowly and carefully ascend the three levels, yet CHEVOO achieved this four months after the plant’s opening.
Any community involvement?
Food Industry Group – Quality Subcommittee Chairwoman
Leadership Santa Rosa Class XXXII
Santa Rosa Metro Chamber Young Professional Network – board member
United States Naval Academy San Francisco Bay Area Chapter – Board Member-Secretary
What is the achievement you are most proud of?
Transitioning CHEVOO’s food production from Oregon to the newly constructed food facility in Sonoma County was an incredible accomplishment for us to achieve. I played a key role in the buildout and launch; the timeline was very ambitious as construction timelines and schedules are often delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. Watching our first production line of CHEVOO jars was a very proud day and a culmination of the entire company’s efforts.
What is your biggest challenge today?
We are in the process of streamlining our processes while simultaneously bringing on new clients with the new challenges they present.
Words that best describe you: Bold, driven, dedicated, and resourceful
As a successful female professional, what were the biggest obstacles you faced and how did you overcome them?
The work life balance is very challenging for those of us who choose to be a professional while raising a family. I overcome this by leveraging my friends and family to assist with raising my daughter, for I truly feel that ‘it takes a village.’

How do you think your profession will change in the next five years?
The food industry will begin to see more automation and there will be a corresponding shift towards paperless record keeping and documentation via technology and information systems to make audits easier and less stressing.
Who was your most important mentor? And tell us a little bit about that person:
Sally Srok - president, direct to consumer of Francis Ford Coppola Winery. She is an incredible woman who has broken the glass ceiling in her field and inspires other women through her example to be consummate professionals without losing our personal identities. Personally, she has also taught me that the work-life balance is possible, so that I can be both a working professional and the best mother possible to my daughter
What advice would you give to a young woman entering your profession or the work world today?
As a professional, it is unrealistic to expect everything to be perfect at all times. Failures are a very important part of becoming successful and should be viewed as learning opportunities. Accept every challenge, opportunity for growth and improvement, and learn from each one to make you more capable for the next trial you will inevitably face. Bottom line: Do not be afraid to get uncomfortable. Growth rarely happens within your comfort zone.
Most admired businessperson outside your organization: Elon Musk
Typical day at the office: The challenges faced in a start-up do not allow for a “typical day.”
Best place to work outside of your office: On the beach with my daughter and Wi-Fi to enable me to access every resource I need to accomplish
Current reading:” A Man on the Moon – The Voyage of the Apollo Astronauts,” by Andrew Chaikin.
Most want to meet: Jane Goodall
Social media you most use: Facebook
Stress relievers: Picnics with my daughter and chihuahua, hot yoga, full moon hiking, going to the beach
Favorite hobbies: Camping, SCUBA, amateur astronomy.

Chevoo
140 Grove Court, Healdsburg
707.931.4400
Employees: 13
Founded: 2015
www.chevoo.com












With less than a year at its new Healdsburg home at 140 Grove Court, Gerard and Susan Tuck’s Chevoo Inc. artisan goat cheese company is increasing production to over 200,000 units a month, while expanding distribution from only 40 stores in December 2015 to more than 1,000 today in the U.S. and overseas — a number expected to reach 1,500 by year end.The company uses modern equipment, technology and precision planning techniques to streamline production efforts and efficiency, while also preparing for future product lines and possible new USDA food regulations predicted next year.To achieve this, Chevoo has deployed a combination of web applications and cloud-based programs to allow for easy data entry and analysis, while also optimizing employee work flow regardless of their location and current assignments. Together these high-tech tools enable quick decision-making in a lean manufacturing setting and a paperless environment.“We’ve had to pinch ourselves a bit in response to the widespread demand for our product. Well before Chevoo’s second anniversary, market acceptance has exceeded our wildest dreams,” Gerard Tuck said. “We are increasingly hard pressed to find specialty retailers in NorCal that do not already carry our products, and are expanding nationally.”The quality of the Chevoo product line is only part of the story. Behind the scenes, the company’s state-of-the-art, all stainless steel food processing and manufacturing facility produces its current range of marinated goat cheeses, as well as a range of other specialty food products.“The Tuck’s dedication to quality, food and human safety exceeds that of any company I have worked for,” said Operations Manager Cheriene Griffith.Entering the Chevoo production area is similar to going into a biotech clean room. Sterile coveralls, hats, shoes and gloves must be worn as workers transition from the administrative to manufacturing sections of the 10,000-square-foot building.“I once had a boss that asked me ‘would you allow your dearest friends and family to eat food made in your facility?’ With this in mind, we wanted to ensure that our production process was world-class when it comes to food safety,” said Tuck.This due diligence paid off for Chevoo when it came to receiving the Food & Drug Administration’s coveted SQF (Safe Quality Food) level 3 “excellent” certification in March — the highest level attainable. Furthermore, in less than six months, the company achieved OSHA Golden Partner certification status; the TraceGains Con Audit Readiness Award as well as being licensed as a California Dairy Plant. Chevoo’s products are gluten free and ideal for vegetarian meals. In addition, the company has also obtained organic and kosher certifications.More shifts have been added in response to Chevoo’s rapid increase in production and sales, but there is still time in the schedule for some contract manufacturing. Today the company’s plant is being used to make products for two other specialty food brands in California, more than tripling overall production.At the same time, Chevoo is planning to introduce two new flavors in October, including Tupelo Honey & Lime, and Black Italian Truffle. These products will be in addition to its current line featuring Smoked Sea Salt & Rosemary, California Dill Pollen & Garlic, and Aleppo-Urfa Chili & Lemon varieties. A new Chevoo product line is scheduled to launch in January 2018, but the Tuck’s are keeping their plans close to the vest until the reveal.

“Our ability to ramp up so fast may appear unusual for a young company, but we wanted to invest in our future upfront to stay ahead of the growth curve,” Tuck said. “We looked ahead five years in an attempt to determine what we would need for production, space, equipment and team members so we could expand quickly and easily. Instead of just cobbling equipment together in an old random facility, we wanted to have everything in place to take advantage of future possibilities.”Anticipating a major step up in U.S. Department of Agriculture food regulations in 2018, Chevoo’s owners wanted to make sure they will comply.“As part of its ongoing vision for continuous improvement, the USDA wants to standardize and elevate food safety processes among the 10s of thousands of food manufacturers in the U.S., especially when it comes to the best ways to produce food,” Tuck said. “This is why we built an advanced manufacturing facility with quality assurance features that anticipate potential regulatory changes — and then some.”

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
