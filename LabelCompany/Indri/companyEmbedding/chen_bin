   Shoe Headlights | Yanko Design       
                   Shoe Headlights  By  Long Tran   04/02/2008  The title of this post says it all, headlights on your shoe. Pioneer is a concept shoe that coverts kinetic walking energy into electrical energy. There’s a tiny battery that charges up with each step and can keep the headlights on for a full 12 hours straight dispersing light at 1.5 meters.Although the aesthetic design seems quite simple, it’s purposeful. The material is waterproof but breathes. The sole is solid rubber to absorb shock and also shields your foot from weird electrical happenings.This kind of reminds me of my L.A. Gear red LED sneakers. Anybody remember those? I use to force myself to walk, hop, jump – anything to make them flash.Designer: Feijun Chen & Bin Zhao Share Pin Tweet Stumble ShareShares 56  Related Posts    Share Pin Tweet Stumble ShareShares 2.5K     This Wallet Takes Photographs of Thieves You know what, honestly I enjoy sitting back and watching one wallet after another just trounce each other with better designs and abilities.

Im gonna have to start carrying a torch round- however if i had these i wouldnt forget my torch. Curves says: 04/03/2008 at 6:35 amWould be nice if they had tail lights too. I walk for fitness year round and here in the northern climes it gets dark early in the winter. Though I stick primarily to the sidewalks, but I do whatever I can to be visible to motorists (including reflective tape on my jacket) but the movement and light of these might help my visability as well.Dont run me over, Bro. Git Em SteveDave says: 04/03/2008 at 6:36 amI too walk after work/at night. I went and invested in a little flashing LED bicycle taillight which has variable blink patterns. It’s visible up to a mile away, and was only ~$8. I wear it attached to my Camelbak, so as I walk, it moves as well as blinks. I also wear a headlight which I attached a smaller LED blink light I got from WallyWorld for $0.50. The headlight lights my path, as well as illuminates the reflective belt/sash I wear b/c it’s LED. The taillight has lasted me well over a year w/ the same batteries. I wouldn’t like lights on my feet as the light doesn’t stay steady, and I like my lights at around my head level, b/c that’s about eye level w/ a driver. zenpoet says: 04/03/2008 at 6:37 amHow can these be useful? I know when I run that I do not hold me feet parallel to the ground at all times, and the effect of show mounted lights would seem a bit like strobe lights in the area ahead.Sounds like it would just make me sick. AG says: 04/03/2008 at 8:10 amThis designer is lame.I’ve seen this concept in the SKYMALL magazines on airplanes, at least 10 years ago!!If you’re going to design  info-mercial worthy products, don’t sign your name to it.

Andrew says: 04/05/2008 at 10:38 amGreat Idea for running at night. It’s like the model of the LA gear shoes that actualy matters to people. It would almost be cooler if they died quick so you had to keep running to keep the light going. Christine says: 04/05/2008 at 12:57 pmWow, I love this idea. It would be awesome for late night or early morning joggers who need to see the ground ahed of them. Too many times have people tripped over pot holes or sidewalks because they can’t see below their feet.

Any serious runner who runs after dark would wear these — and not care in the slightest how they look.Combine the headlights with a great running shoe and I’d wear ’em — even if they were bright orange, pink, green and yellow.Wait, I’d wear ’em more if they were crazy funky colors like that. I’ll be watching for these to hit the market someday! Pingback: 12 Cool Shoes Every Geek Will Love Zane says: 05/20/2012 at 11:16 pmMost research has verified that the taller guys achieve better results within their line of works as well as regulate the appreciation from the co-workers. Tall people are regarded to be more handsome as well as receive the recognition of great looking females. It is well recognized thought that several females discover taller males to eventually become saucier and good-looking.
