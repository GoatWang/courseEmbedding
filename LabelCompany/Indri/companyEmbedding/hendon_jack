Description



Product Description
This is a joint programme created for the games against Lewes and Barking.
Saturday 4 October 2014 saw Lewes FC travel to Earlsmead to face Hendon FC in the league. A hotly contested match saw goals by Leon Smith and Lee O’Leary for Hendon. Jack Dixon netted for Lewes. The final score 2 – 1 was only achieved in the dying seconds of the game. It kept Hendon in 3rd in the league. However, it was also Hendon’s 10th undefeated game and gave Leon a post war record of scoring in 7 consecutive matches.
Two days later Hendon settled into the usual exit from the London Senior Cup. However, they shocked everyone by going 11 consecutive games unbeaten but also making it to the next round of the LSC. Belal Aite-Ouakrim did what he did best and scored twice. Leon Smith extended his scoring in consecutive games by making it 8 with his goal. Ryan Creed was Barking’s scorer.
Wherever Hendon have got their lucky magic lamp they need to keep rubbing it.
This is the PDF version of the printed programme available on the day.
