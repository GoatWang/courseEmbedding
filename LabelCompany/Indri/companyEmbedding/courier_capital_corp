Retirement Plans
Offering a retirement plan is a significant undertaking for any employer, large or small. It demonstrates your sincere regard for your employees, your concern about their future. It reflects your generosity — even if you don't match their contributions, you commit considerable time, effort and resources to establish and manage the plan. And because the laws governing your retirement plan are complicated, it also imposes substantial responsibility. Read more

‘The product is the company’



Courier asks three of London’s leading venture capitalists the big question: What do investors want? Here, Balderton Capital’s Anna Boffetta talks about the product itself.
Venture capital is a shoe- leather industry; VCs rack up a lot of miles. Due to the sheer volume of fascinating entrepreneurs and great businesses we meet, the job requires a well-refined system to appraise what a good company looks like.
As far as prospective products and services go, you can divide them into three major categories: core technologies; transactions and subscriptions; and networks and communities.
1. Core technology
This is problem solving in a fundamentally new way, and based around the strength of the technology alone. These companies are not always focused on a specific industry, and the founders are usually extremely smart technologists, often PhDs. Deep Mind and Magic Pony are great examples of this type of company.
I look at the underlying technology, its uniqueness, its efficiencies, and how it could be applied within a particular industry, or to improve the success of a specific task. The commercial application comes next.
2. Transactions and subscriptions
The vast majority of tech startups fall under this category. The stats do the talking for these companies. I look for product or market fit, traction, and scalability. User data is crucial here: conversion, retention and churn; revenues; and opportunities for product up-selling and cross-selling. I like to see that companies are getting bigger, and that they are intelligently improving the product and driving revenue, even on a monthly basis.
Examples of companies in this category are Airbnb, Transferwise, Slack and Yoox Net-a-Porter.
3. Network or community
The value for these products lies in the users. Most of them are mobile first, and laser-focused on a particular industry: web curation; social networks; transportation apps; information services.
I look at cohorts; how downloads or visits can be converted into users – specifically at how many return monthly, weekly, and daily. I also look at churn after one, three, six and 12 months. And I want to understand how the company acquired its users: through organic growth, or paid channels?
This process helps me understand why people will use this product, and the value of the data that’s generated by these users. User data can shape the monetisation opportunities too.
Examples include Facebook, Whatsapp, Clue and Citymapper.
Common characteristics of great products 
There are also some general areas we analyse. I believe user experience reveals a lot about the culture of the company; its soul. In addition, we appraise how the company differs from competitors and the sustainability of the product over time.
The main thing to remember is that a ‘product’ involves more than just a product team. Product is the net result of the whole team’s effort. For your product or service to really click with the market, it has to click within the company first.
Anna Boffetta is an associate at Balderton Capital.
This story is taken from the Dec 2016/Jan 2017 issue of Courier.
