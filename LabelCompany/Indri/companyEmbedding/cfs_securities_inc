Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Credit Card


                                            I thought this was a good program until I tried to order a Yeti cooler on the members mall and every cooler in every size was out of stock. So I ordered $400 in gift cards instead to purchase the item at a retailer. After about 3 weeks of waiting the cards never showed up. I...show more

                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied. Did a status check to see where I sat with the promotion 80% at the spending goal and was told there was no promotion. So I closed all AMEX cards but this one and plan...show more

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks. When you sign up it claims no annual fee, no monthly fees, etc. However now there is a minimum monthly payment even if you you have a zero balance. So I'm...show more
