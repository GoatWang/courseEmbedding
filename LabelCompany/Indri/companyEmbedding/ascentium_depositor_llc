BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Ascentium Capital, LLC has received 2.78 out of 5 stars based on 3 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of B.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Supplier Spotlights: Anheuser-Busch, Hershey & Ascentium Capital
Partnerships, promotions and awards are in the news for suppliers.

April 27, 2017, 12:00 pm



 



NATIONAL REPORT — While it's important for convenience store retailers to market themselves, new products, services, promotions and other initiatives by c-store suppliers are a major part of capturing consumer interest. Convenience Store News will regularly highlight such efforts in this roundup.
Here are the latest supplier spotlights:
Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch extended its marketing partnership with the PGA Tour, continuing Michelob ULTRA's designation as Official Beer Sponsor of the PGA TOUR and PGA TOUR Champions through 2020. As part of the renewal, O'Doul's will also continue to serve as the Official Non-Alcohol Brew of the PGA TOUR and PGA TOUR Champions.
Michelob ULTRA will maintain a significant presence at more than 45 tournaments on the PGA TOUR, PGA TOUR Champions and Web.com Tour. New stops in 2017 include the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play in Austin, Texas, and the Presidents Cup at Liberty National in Jersey City, N.J.
"Michelob ULTRA is proud to continue its designation as the official beer sponsor of the PGA TOUR," said Eelco van der Noll, vice president, experiential marketing at Anheuser-Busch. "It allows us to interact with golf fans across the country and provide unique experiences only Michelob ULTRA can bring."
The beer brand will also expand its onsite fan engagement by adding more tournament stops for the mobile Build-a-Bar, a 40-foot high-end beer selling station featuring plasma screens and a rooftop viewing area.
Michelob ULTRA also became the Official Beer Sponsor of the World Surf League (WSL) in the U.S. Through this new partnership, Michelob ULTRA will be the exclusive beer sponsor of WSL events in the country.
This new partnership is part of Michelob ULTRA's strategy of driving continued growth by engaging drinkers who embrace and prioritize an active, balanced lifestyle, according to the company.
"As our brand continues to gain momentum, our new partnership with the World Surf League will further connect us to those who are passionate about living the active and balanced lifestyle that Michelob ULTRA celebrates," said Azania Andrews, vice president, Michelob ULTRA.
Finally, Michelob ULTRA formed another new partnership with Brooks Koepka, the world's 25th ranked golfer and 2016 Ryder Cup breakout player. This includes appearances at consumer events and inclusion in multimedia platforms.
"Michelob ULTRA has long been the go-to choice for golfers and golf fans alike. Our new pairing with Brooks Koepka further strengthens our connection to the game and reinforces our support for those who pursue active, balanced lifestyles," said Andrews. "As one of the sport's most impressive young stars, Brooks continues to ascend at a rapid pace and is an ideal fit for the fastest-growing beer brand in the U.S."
Ascentium Capital
National commercial lender Ascentium Capital LLC announced that first quarter funded volume reached $225.1 million, representing 25.5 percent growth and managed $1.6 billion in assets, representing a 37.7 percent increase year over year in the first quarter of 2017.
Ascentium Capital also experienced a record month in March with $259.6 million in credit application volume.
"Our financial relationship platform powers our performance. We continue to scale our operations and integrated infrastructure to deliver positive business outcomes that benefit our equipment vendors and small business clients nationwide," said CEO Tom Depping.
The company specializes in providing a broad range of financing, leasing and small business loans.
Broaster Co.
Broaster Co. announced Team Genuine Broaster Chicken Honda, a key player in the Superbike class for the 2017 MotoAmerica season. This marks the first year Broaster's involvement with the RoadRace factory is elevated to a corporate-wide level of participation.
"We're excited to build our brand beyond foodservice as a part of the RoadRace Factory," said Jay Cipra, president and CEO of Broaster Co. "We're looking at some very exciting things for the future of the Broaster Co. Team Genuine Broaster Chicken Honda allows us to connect with our customers and consumers unlike never before. Our partnership gives our fans something more to cheer about."
Team Genuine Broaster Chicken Honda comprises the experienced team owner Danny Walker, veteran rider Jake Gagne and motorcycles and technical support from Honda.
Carlin Group
The Carlin Group, a privately owned full-service brokerage and member of BeaconUnited, as well as a leading regional sales and marketing solutions company, acquired Des Moines, Iowa-based Johnson-Holmes & Associates.
"We're looking forward to having a stronger presence in Iowa and parts of Nebraska," said Jeff Mahler, president of Carlin Group. "Johnson-Holmes & Associates' deep local roots make the company a great match for our organization."
Johnson-Holmes & Associates customers include Farner-Bocken, Hy-Vee, Fareway, Casey's General Stores and Kum & Go convenience stores.
"We are excited about providing additional services and resources to our customers and management by becoming part of the Carlin Group," said Johnson-Holmes President and CEO Paul Johnson, son of the firm's founder, Paul Johnson Senior. He will continue to work with the Carlin Group.
E-Alternative Solutions
A sister company to Swisher International, E-Alternative Solutions launched a national advertising campaign for its Cue Vapor System. Cue provides simple vaping in the form of a premium-performance, stylish device that can be operated with the click of a cartridge and the push of a button, according to the company.
Electrolux
As part of an effort to broaden the offerings of its foodservice business and accelerate the growth of the professional products business area, Electrolux acquired Louisville, Ky.-based Grindmaster-Cecilware, a manufacturer of hot, cold and frozen beverage dispensing equipment, including coffee machines. The cash deal was worth $108 million.
"We are very pleased to complement our portfolio with such an attractive range of beverage products, as the combination better meets customer needs, especially among food service chains," said Alberto Zanata, head of Electrolux business area professional products. "This move will also reinforce our presence in North America, one of the largest global markets for professional appliances."
Grindmaster-Cecilware has manufacturing facilities in Louisville and in Rayong, Thailand, and employed approximately 200 people. Its net sales exceeded $65 million in 2016.
The Hershey Co.
The Hershey Co. announced a five-year extension with CBS Sports, Turner Sports and the NCAA to continue its role as Official Confectionery Partner. Its Reese's brand will return as title sponsor of the Reese's College All-Star Game and will continue to host a kick-off to Final Four weekend with Reese's Final Four Friday.
