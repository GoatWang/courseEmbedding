Remember to Flourish Audio Session
REMEMBER to FLOURISH!
Trade in your experience of struggle for an authentic sense of well-being, balance and centeredness regardless of the circumstances. The secret is adopting a regular practice of self-reflection that moves you beyond your ego to the inner wisdom in your heart.
The primary barrier we hear about from our clients (and have found ourselves) is remembering to set aside the time to do it. So, we developed the Remember to Flourish weekly guided Remembrance call to support you.
Each week you will receive:

A reminder email of the next guided session.
The 30-minute weekly program:

A short teaching on how to best use the Remembrance;
A guided session with other community members on the line.


An email providing a link to the session recording after the call in case you were unable to join us live.

Subscription lasts for one year.  Subscription payment options are to pay $10 monthly or $99 for the year.

 
 
 



Annual Subscription
You will pay a one time charge of $99.  Subscription will end after one year.

Subscribe Now

 


Monthly Subscription
You will be charged $10/month for 12 months, after which the subscription will stop automatically.
