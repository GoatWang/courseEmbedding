Power of the Bead




The Power of the Bead
CytoSorbents has developed a unique and powerful blood filtration and purification technology based on its proprietary biocompatible, highly porous polymer bead platform. Each of these spherical beads are approximately the size of a grain of salt and synthesized to contain millions of optimally-sized pores and channels. These pores and channels collectively have a massive surface area that enable the bead to behave like a tiny sponge to safely bind and effectively remove a broad range of inflammatory and toxic substances from whole blood and plasma via pore capture and surface adsorption. Large substances, such as blood cells cannot get into the pores and go around the bead unaffected. Similarly, very small substances, such as electrolytes, are too small to be captured and go through the beads unaffected. But appropriately sized substances migrate into the pores of the beads and get adsorbed to the external and internal surfaces of the pores and channels, never to come out. Variations of these beads form the basis of CytoSorbents’ flagship product, CytoSorb®, for the treatment of deadly inflammation seen in critical illnesses and after cardiac surgery, and HemoDefend™, for the purification of transfused blood products of contaminants that can cause potentially dangerous transfusion reactions.

State-of-the-Art Blood Purification Technology
CytoSorbents’ advanced bead technology combines numerous advantages into a single blood purification platform.

Proprietary polymer technology: CytoSorbents’ beads are composed of a specially modified, chemically inert, polystyrenic co-polymer protected by 32 issued U.S. patents and multiple applications pending worldwide
Highly biocompatible: The beads are ISO 10993 certified for biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, no genotoxicity, no cytotoxicity, no acute sensitivity, and no complement activation
Pure: No residual organics, no leachables, meets USP particulate standards for large parenteral injections
Massive surface area: A single 300 mL cartridge filled with CytoSorb® beads has more than 40,000 square meters of internal and external surface area on which to adsorb and remove toxic substances
Selective, multi-modal separation: Blood is composed of a wide range of substances, ranging from water, cells, electrolytes, hormones, sugars, lipids, and proteins. The technology achieves selectivity by using size exclusion as the first step in separation. Next, the hydrophobic “water-fearing” polymer effectively adsorbs hydrophobic substances and excludes hydrophilic “water-loving” ones. Substances that do not adsorb leave the bead, while those that do adsorb will migrate further and further into the beads, lost in the vast network of channels, unable to escape.
Excellent adsorption of proteins, bioactive lipids, and toxins: Many of the inflammatory mediators that drive the deadly inflammatory process, including cytokines, toxins, activated complement, enzymes, and bioactive lipids, are preferentially removed by the technology
Superior kinetics: Beads are in direct contact with blood, actively removing substance with no need for them to diffuse across a semi-permeable membrane as with dialysis and hemofiltration
Concentration Dependent Removal: High concentrations of toxins provide a driving force gradient to push substances into the pores of the bead. Because of this, the technology is very good at removing toxic levels of substances. As the concentration of the substance decreases, so does the ability of the device to extract it. This creates an inherent “self-titrating” aspect to the technology that prevents the excessive removal of substances and makes it difficult to overtreat
Gamma stable, thermostable, and chemically inert: The polymer is very robust and stable, allowing easy gamma sterilization, stability at a broad range of temperatures, and resistance to chemical change in most physiologic environments
Rapidly customized: The beads can be easily modified during polymer synthesis to create beads with identical chemical structure, but with very different porous structures. For example, beads can be made with very small pores similar to activated charcoal to remove drugs and small molecules. Alternatively, the pores can be made very large to capture very large antibodies and other substances even larger than 1,000 kDa. In addition, the beads can be further modified to incorporate most major mechanisms to separate substances including polarity, charge, size-exclusion, and affinity
Broad spectrum “mix and match” capability: The ability to mix and match beads with different extraction capabilities provides a flexibility to remove a broad range of substances that no other technology can match
High flow, low resistance: Blood can flow rapidly through a bead-filled device with low resistance, achieving flow rates of 100-700 mL/min without causing hemolysis or high pressure drops across the device
Stable with Long Shelf Life: Solid state chemistry with no cells, biologics or other perishable materials, gamma sterilized with 3-year shelf life at room temperature.


Technology is the Beneficiary of More than $19M in Government Funding
CytoSorbents’ blood and physiologic fluid purification technology aims to solve some of the most important unmet medical needs in medicine, from treating life-threatening illnesses in the intensive care unit, to reducing dangerous complications of surgery, to ensuring the quality and safety of the blood supply. It combines the company’s proprietary hemocompatible porous polymer bead platform with robust and cost-effective manufacturing, compatibility with a worldwide infrastructure of existing dialysis and heart-lung machines, ease of use,
In 2012, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded CytoSorbents a $3.8M five year contract as part of its “Dialysis-Like Therapeutics” (DLT) program to treat severe sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis is the result of an overzealous immune response to a serious infection. The DLT program seeks to develop an advanced blood purification system that can remove toxins, cytokines, pathogens and activated white blood cells as a treatment of sepsis. CytoSorbents’ technology was selected to remove cytokines and pathogen-derived toxins. DARPA is a division of the Department of Defense that funds advanced technology and biomedical research, and was responsible for funding the development of such major innovations as the internet, global positioning satellites (GPS), robotic surgery, artificial robotic limbs, a stair-climbing wheelchair, and many others. CytoSorbents collaborates with leading institutions and companies such as Battelle Laboratories, the Harvard Wyss Institute, MIT, and NxStage Medical.
In addition, CytoSorbents is advancing its polymer platform under a $1.15M Phase I and II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract awarded by the U.S. Army for trauma and burn injury research (2011-present).
CytoSorbents was also awarded a $1.15M Phase I and II SBIR contract from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to advance development of its HemoDefend blood purification platform to improve the quality and safety of transfused blood products and to keep fresh blood fresh.

About Us




CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO) is a New Jersey-based, critical care immunotherapy company specializing in blood purification to control deadly inflammation in critically-ill and cardiac surgery patients. The company’s flagship product, CytoSorb®, is approved in the European Union with distribution in 43 countries around the world, as a safe and effective extracorporeal cytokine adsorber, designed to reduce the “cytokine storm” or “cytokine release syndrome” that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical illnesses such as sepsis, burn injury, trauma, lung injury, and pancreatitis, as well as in cancer immunotherapy. These are conditions where the risk of death and cost of treatment are extremely high, yet no effective treatments exist. CytoSorb® is also being used during and after cardiac surgery to remove inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and free hemoglobin, that can lead to post-operative complications, including multiple organ failure. CytoSorb® has been used safely in more than 23,000 human treatments to date.
CytoSorbents’ blood purification technologies are based on advanced, biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. Each polymer bead, approximately the size of a grain of salt, contains millions of pores and channels that can be modified to remove substances as small as drugs, to substances as large as antibodies from blood. These beads are synthesized at CytoSorbents’ ISO 13485 certified manufacturing facility in New Jersey. The Company has numerous products under development based upon this unique blood purification technology, protected by 32 issued U.S. patents and multiple applications pending, including CytoSorb-XL, HemoDefend™, ContrastSorb, DrugSorb, and others.
CytoSorb®
CytoSorb® is approved for sale in all 28 countries of the European Union (E.U.) as an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber, designed to control deadly systemic inflammation by reducing excessive cytokines, bacterial toxins, and many other factors from blood that “fuel the fire” of inflammation. Left unchecked, this uncontrolled inflammation can lead to organ injury, organ failure, and in many cases, death of the patient. The blood purification cartridge can be used with most kinds of extracorporeal blood pumps including standard hemodialysis machines, continuous renal replacement (CRRT) machines, heart-lung machines, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines, in any situation where cytokines are elevated. This includes a diverse range of conditions where excessive cytokines and other inflammatory toxins are driving a potentially dangerous inflammatory response. These include acute critical illnesses such as sepsis and infection, burn injury, trauma, acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe acute pancreatitis, liver failure, influenza, cytokine release syndrome in CAR T-cell immunotherapy, and complications of cardiac surgery, as well as in other more chronic diseases such as cancer, cancer cachexia, autoimmune diseases, and others. CytoSorb® is also being used intra-operatively during open heart surgery in a bypass circuit in a heart-lung machine to pre-emptively reduce inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, activated complement, and plasma free hemoglobin that are generated during the surgery and can lead to post-operative inflammation and organ failure. CytoSorb® has been used in more than 23,000 human treatments to date and have been credited with saving many lives.
With registration, CytoSorb® can also be sold outside of the E.U. in countries that accept European medical device approval. CytoSorb® is being sold directly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, and marketed through distributors in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Jordan), Israel, Turkey, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, and many other countries.
Our strategic partner Fresenius Medical Care, the largest dialysis company in the world, is currently distributing CytoSorb® in France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Poland for critical care applications. Terumo Cardiovascular, a global leader in cardiac and vascular surgery, has also partnered with us to exclusively distribute CytoSorb® for cardiac surgery applications in France, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. CytoSorb® is currently also being sold in India, Sri Lanka, and select emerging markets through our strategic partner, Biocon Ltd, India’s largest biopharmaceutical company.  In addition, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, an international pharmaceutical firm, will distribute  CytoSorb® in South Africa.
There are more than 58 investigator-initiated studies in various stages of process in Europe and Asia using CytoSorb® in a wide variety of applications, with approximately half either starting, enrolling patients, or completed.  In addition, the International CytoSorb® Registry has been established to collect and analyze treatment data from all over the world, and is being independently managed by the Center of Clinical Studies at the University of Jena, Germany.
The company has successfully completed its 46-patient randomized, controlled, U.S. based REFRESH (REduction of FREe Hemoglobin) I cardiac surgery safety and feasibility trial, using CytoSorb® intra-operatively during elective, non-emergent complex cardiac surgery.  The study supported the safety and ability of the device to Pending discussions with the FDA, the company plans to begin a pivotal REFRESH 2 trial later in 2017, intended to achieve registration and approval of CytoSorb® in the U.S. for the application of cardiac surgery.
HemoDefend
HemoDefend™ is a development-stage blood purification technology platform for the blood transfusion industry intended to reduce transfusion reactions and safeguard the quality and safety of blood products. The HemoDefend technology utilizes the Company’s polymer bead technology to remove many substances, such as antibodies, free hemoglobin, potassium, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators that can cause potentially serious and sometimes fatal transfusion reactions.
The Future of Blood Purification is Now
CytoSorb® and HemoDefend™ are just two of a number of different sorbents the Company has designed for various medical applications, including improved dialysis, the potential treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, rhabdomyolysis in trauma, removal of chemotherapy drugs during treatment of cancer with high dose regional chemotherapy, removal of IV contrast, treatment of drug intoxication, and others. Additional information is available in the Investor Relations section.
CytoSorbents and its technology has garnered more than $19 million in support from the U.S. government. DARPA, or the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as part of its “Dialysis-Like Therapeutics” program to treat sepsis, awarded CytoSorbents a $3.8 million five year contract to develop cytokine and toxin binders for the program. CytoSorbents collaborates with groups such as Battelle Laboratories, Harvard’s Wyss Institute, NxStage Medical (NASDAQ: NXTM), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others in this program. CytoSorbents was also awarded $1.65 million by the U.S. Army in a Phase I, Phase II and Phase II Enhancement SBIR contract to develop its blood purification technologies to treat burn injury and trauma. The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biologic Defense (JPEO-CBD)  awarded CytoSorbents $1.15 million in SBIR Phase I and II contracts to develop countermeasures for fungal mycotoxin exposure.  The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) awarded CytoSorbents a $150K Phase I SBIR grant to develop novel potassium binding sorbents to treat severe hyperkalemia. Also,  CytoSorbents has also been awarded $1.7 million in Phase I and II SBIR contracts from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to further develop its HemoDefend™ technology for blood transfusions. The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) also awarded a $1.15 million Phase I and II STTR contract to CytoSorbents to develop universal plasma.
CytoSorbents operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CytoSorbents Medical Inc. (fka CytoSorbents Inc.), and conducts its European business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CytoSorbents Europe GmbH. CytoSorbents Corporation converted from a Nevada Corporation to a Delaware Corporation in December 2014.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
