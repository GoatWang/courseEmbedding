My Profile 





Working at AMAG


Every day, the people at AMAG recommit to each other, the patients and families we serve, and our promise to society.
AMAG employees are a passionate group of people committed to supporting the health of patients and families facing complex and potentially serious conditions.

Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)
Indication
Makena helps reduce the risk of preterm birth in the indicated patient population.1
Makena is a progestin indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. The effectiveness of Makena is based on improvement in the proportion of women who delivered <37 weeks of gestation. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a direct clinical benefit such as improvement in neonatal mortality and morbidity.1
Limitation of use: While there are many risk factors for preterm birth, safety and efficacy of Makena has been demonstrated only in women with a prior spontaneous singleton preterm birth. It is not intended for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.1
Important Safety Information for Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)

Do not use Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) in women with any of the following conditions:

Current or history of thrombosis or thromboembolic disorders
Known or suspected breast cancer, other hormone-sensitive cancer, or history of these conditions
Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding unrelated to pregnancy
Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy
Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or active liver disease
Uncontrolled hypertension1


Makena should be discontinued if thrombosis or thromboembolism occurs1
Allergic reactions, including urticaria, pruritus and angioedema, have been reported with use of Makena or with other products containing castor oil.1
Women receiving Makena should be monitored if they:

Are prediabetic or diabetic
Have conditions that may be affected by fluid retention, such as preeclampsia, epilepsy, cardiac or renal dysfunction
Develop jaundice: consider whether benefit of use warrants continuation
Develop hypertension1



Certain pregnancy-related fetal and maternal complications or events were numerically increased in Makena-treated subjects as compared to placebo subjects, including miscarriage (2.4% vs. 0%) and stillbirth (2% vs. 1.3%), admission for preterm labor (16% vs. 13.8%), preeclampsia or gestational hypertension (8.8% vs. 4.6%), gestational diabetes (5.6% vs. 4.6%), and oligohydramnios (3.6% vs. 1.3%).1
The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of subjects and at a higher rate in the Makena group than in the control group were injection site reactions pain [35% vs. 33%], swelling [17% vs. 8%], pruritus [6% vs. 3%], and nodule [5% vs. 2%]), urticaria (12% vs. 11%), pruritus (8% vs. 6%), nausea (6% vs. 5%), and diarrhea (2% vs. 1%).1
Please see full prescribing information for Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection).
Please see patient information for Makena.



Feraheme® (ferumoxytol) Injection For Intravenous (IV) Use
Indication and Dosing
Feraheme is indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).2
The recommended dose of Feraheme is an initial 510 mg dose followed by a second 510 mg dose 3 to 8 days later, each dose infused over at least 15 minutes while the patient is in a reclined or semi-reclined position.2
Important Information about Feraheme® (ferumoxytol) Injection
WARNING: RISK FOR SERIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY/ANAPHYLAXIS REACTIONS
Fatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving Feraheme.2 Initial symptoms may include hypotension, syncope, unresponsiveness, cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest.2

Only administer Feraheme when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions.2
Observe for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and for at least 30 minutes following Feraheme infusion including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and after Feraheme administration.2
Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients in whom a previous Feraheme dose was tolerated.2


Contraindications
Feraheme is contraindicated in patients with:

Known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its components
History of allergic reaction to any intravenous iron product2

Warnings and Precautions

Fatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, presenting with cardiac/ cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, or unresponsiveness have occurred in patients receiving Feraheme. Other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity have occurred (pruritus, rash, urticaria, and wheezing). These reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses in patients in whom a previous Feraheme dose was tolerated.2
Patients with a history of multiple drug allergies may have a greater risk of anaphylaxis with parenteral iron products. Carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before administering Feraheme to these patients.2
Only administer Feraheme when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions. Closely observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and after Feraheme administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of each infusion.2
In clinical studies predominantly in patients with CKD, serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.2% (3/1,726) of subjects receiving Feraheme. Other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria or wheezing) were reported in 3.7% (63/1,726) of these subjects. In other trials excluding patients with Stages 4 and 5 CKD, moderate to severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 2.6% (26/1014) of patients treated with Feraheme.2
In the post-marketing experience, fatal and serious anaphylactic type reactions presenting with cardiac/ cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, and unresponsiveness have been reported. Elderly patients with multiple or serious co-morbidities who experience hypersensitivity reactions and/or hypotension following administration of Feraheme may have more severe outcomes.2
Severe adverse reactions of clinically significant hypotension have been reported in the post-marketing experience. In clinical studies, hypotension was reported in 1.9% (33/1,726) of subjects, including three patients with serious hypotensive reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each Feraheme administration.2
Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. Patients should be regularly monitored for hematologic response during parenteral iron therapy, noting that lab assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron values in the 24 hours following administration of Feraheme.2
As a superparamagnetic iron oxide, Feraheme may transiently affect magnetic resonance diagnostic imaging studies for up to 3 months following the last Feraheme dose. Feraheme will not affect X-ray, CT, PET, SPECT, ultrasound, or nuclear imaging.2

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) following the administration of Feraheme are diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, hypotension, constipation, and peripheral edema.2
In clinical trials, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in ≥ 2 Feraheme-treated patients included hypotension, infusion site swelling, increased serum ferritin level, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, ecchymosis, pruritus, chronic renal failure, and urticaria.2
The following additional serious adverse reactions have been reported from the post-marketing experience with Feraheme: tachycardia/rhythm abnormalities, angioedema, ischemic myocardial events, congestive heart failure, pulse absent, and cyanosis. These adverse reactions have usually occurred within 30 minutes after the administration of Feraheme. Reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses of Feraheme.2

Please see full prescribing information for Feraheme, including boxed warning.

We issued an updated report on AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMAG  -  Free Report)	 on Jul 4.     Based in Waltham, MA, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company and has three marketed products – Feraheme (ferumoxytol),  an iron replacement product approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), a progestin approved to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth; and MuGard for the management of oral mucositis and stomatitis.In fact, AMAG’s share price movement shows that the company has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry year to date. The stock is down 45.2% compared with industry’s fall of 2.2%.We remind investors that Makena became part of the company’s portfolio following the acquisition of Lumara Health in Nov 2014. Since then Makena has been a significant sales driver for AMAG. Makena's estimated market share expanded to 42% in 2016 with two-third of Makena sales coming from the single-dose vials. In the upcoming quarters, AMAG anticipates an increase in sales of the product. Meanwhile, AMAG is developing an auto-injector device for subcutaneous administration of Makena (Makena SQ), including chemistry, manufacturing and controls development, in partnership with Antares Pharma, Inc.  as well. It is under review in the U.S. and has set a a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of Feb 14, 2018. If approved, Makena SQ auto-injector will ensure easier administration by healthcare providers and less painful injections for patients.Meanwhile, Feraheme continues to grow in both the hospital and hematology/oncology segments. In 2016, the company signed a large hospital group purchasing organizations (GPO) agreement which should broaden the company’s access in large hospital segment and potentially increase its market share. Going forward, AMAG expects service revenues from the Cord Blood Registry (CBR) services (AMAG acquired CBR in Aug 2015) to contribute significantly to the company’s top line due to continued efforts to increase new enrollments of cord blood and cord tissue units in storage facility, and recurring revenue from a growing base of stored units.Notably, AMAG has been pursuing strategic acquisitions and deals to boost its portfolio and pipeline. Evidently, the company added two products to its women’s health portfolio in 2017-Rekynda and Intrarosa.  AMAG acquired exclusive U.S. rights to develop and commercialize Rekynda from Palatin Technologies, Inc. Rekynda is designed for the on-demand treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in pre-menopausal women. The company also bought the U.S. commercial rights to Endoceutics, Inc.’s drug, Intrarosa (prasterone), in February. Intrarosa was approved by the FDA to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) and is expected to be launched in the U.S. by this year.As the company invests in the potential launch of Intrarosa and Makena subcutaneous auto-injector as well as label expansion for Feraheme, the costs of the company will rise which will hurt profits to an extent. Patent challenges for Feraheme might also remain an overhang.AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAMAG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in health care sector include Enzo Biochem, Inc. (ENZ  -  Free Report)	 and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report)	. While Enzo Biochem sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Sanofi holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Enzo Biochem’s loss per share estimates narrowed from 12 cents to 7 cents for 2017 and from 11 cents to 3 cents for 2018 over the last 30 days. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 55.83%. The share price of the company has increased 61.1% year to date.Sanofi’s earnings per share estimates increased from $3.08 to $3.18 for 2017 and from $3.26 to $3.30 for 2018 over last 30 days. The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.10%. The share price of the company has increased 18.2% year to date.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)
Indication
Makena helps reduce the risk of preterm birth in the indicated patient population.1
Makena is a progestin indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. The effectiveness of Makena is based on improvement in the proportion of women who delivered <37 weeks of gestation. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a direct clinical benefit such as improvement in neonatal mortality and morbidity.1
Limitation of use: While there are many risk factors for preterm birth, safety and efficacy of Makena has been demonstrated only in women with a prior spontaneous singleton preterm birth. It is not intended for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.1
Important Safety Information for Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)

Do not use Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) in women with any of the following conditions:

Current or history of thrombosis or thromboembolic disorders
Known or suspected breast cancer, other hormone-sensitive cancer, or history of these conditions
Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding unrelated to pregnancy
Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy
Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or active liver disease
Uncontrolled hypertension1


Makena should be discontinued if thrombosis or thromboembolism occurs1
Allergic reactions, including urticaria, pruritus and angioedema, have been reported with use of Makena or with other products containing castor oil.1
Women receiving Makena should be monitored if they:

Are prediabetic or diabetic
Have conditions that may be affected by fluid retention, such as preeclampsia, epilepsy, cardiac or renal dysfunction
Develop jaundice: consider whether benefit of use warrants continuation
Develop hypertension1



Certain pregnancy-related fetal and maternal complications or events were numerically increased in Makena-treated subjects as compared to placebo subjects, including miscarriage (2.4% vs. 0%) and stillbirth (2% vs. 1.3%), admission for preterm labor (16% vs. 13.8%), preeclampsia or gestational hypertension (8.8% vs. 4.6%), gestational diabetes (5.6% vs. 4.6%), and oligohydramnios (3.6% vs. 1.3%).1
The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of subjects and at a higher rate in the Makena group than in the control group were injection site reactions pain [35% vs. 33%], swelling [17% vs. 8%], pruritus [6% vs. 3%], and nodule [5% vs. 2%]), urticaria (12% vs. 11%), pruritus (8% vs. 6%), nausea (6% vs. 5%), and diarrhea (2% vs. 1%).1
Please see full prescribing information for Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection).
Please see patient information for Makena.



Feraheme® (ferumoxytol) Injection For Intravenous (IV) Use
Indication and Dosing
Feraheme is indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).2
The recommended dose of Feraheme is an initial 510 mg dose followed by a second 510 mg dose 3 to 8 days later, each dose infused over at least 15 minutes while the patient is in a reclined or semi-reclined position.2
Important Information about Feraheme® (ferumoxytol) Injection
WARNING: RISK FOR SERIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY/ANAPHYLAXIS REACTIONS
Fatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving Feraheme.2 Initial symptoms may include hypotension, syncope, unresponsiveness, cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest.2

Only administer Feraheme when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions.2
Observe for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and for at least 30 minutes following Feraheme infusion including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and after Feraheme administration.2
Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients in whom a previous Feraheme dose was tolerated.2


Contraindications
Feraheme is contraindicated in patients with:

Known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its components
History of allergic reaction to any intravenous iron product2

Warnings and Precautions

Fatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, presenting with cardiac/ cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, or unresponsiveness have occurred in patients receiving Feraheme. Other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity have occurred (pruritus, rash, urticaria, and wheezing). These reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses in patients in whom a previous Feraheme dose was tolerated.2
Patients with a history of multiple drug allergies may have a greater risk of anaphylaxis with parenteral iron products. Carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before administering Feraheme to these patients.2
Only administer Feraheme when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions. Closely observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and after Feraheme administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of each infusion.2
In clinical studies predominantly in patients with CKD, serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.2% (3/1,726) of subjects receiving Feraheme. Other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria or wheezing) were reported in 3.7% (63/1,726) of these subjects. In other trials excluding patients with Stages 4 and 5 CKD, moderate to severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 2.6% (26/1014) of patients treated with Feraheme.2
In the post-marketing experience, fatal and serious anaphylactic type reactions presenting with cardiac/ cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, and unresponsiveness have been reported. Elderly patients with multiple or serious co-morbidities who experience hypersensitivity reactions and/or hypotension following administration of Feraheme may have more severe outcomes.2
Severe adverse reactions of clinically significant hypotension have been reported in the post-marketing experience. In clinical studies, hypotension was reported in 1.9% (33/1,726) of subjects, including three patients with serious hypotensive reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each Feraheme administration.2
Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. Patients should be regularly monitored for hematologic response during parenteral iron therapy, noting that lab assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron values in the 24 hours following administration of Feraheme.2
As a superparamagnetic iron oxide, Feraheme may transiently affect magnetic resonance diagnostic imaging studies for up to 3 months following the last Feraheme dose. Feraheme will not affect X-ray, CT, PET, SPECT, ultrasound, or nuclear imaging.2

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) following the administration of Feraheme are diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, hypotension, constipation, and peripheral edema.2
In clinical trials, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in ≥ 2 Feraheme-treated patients included hypotension, infusion site swelling, increased serum ferritin level, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, ecchymosis, pruritus, chronic renal failure, and urticaria.2
The following additional serious adverse reactions have been reported from the post-marketing experience with Feraheme: tachycardia/rhythm abnormalities, angioedema, ischemic myocardial events, congestive heart failure, pulse absent, and cyanosis. These adverse reactions have usually occurred within 30 minutes after the administration of Feraheme. Reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses of Feraheme.2

Please see full prescribing information for Feraheme, including boxed warning.

AMAG Pharmaceuticals Focuses on Product Development & Buyouts


July 05, 2017, 09:53:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 We issued an updated report on AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AMAG  on Jul 4.      Based in Waltham, MA, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company and has three marketed products - Feraheme (ferumoxytol),  an iron replacement product approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), a progestin approved to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth; and MuGard for the management of oral mucositis and stomatitis. In fact, AMAG's share price movement shows that the company has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical - Biomedical and Genetics  industry year to date. The stock is down 45.2% compared with industry's fall of 2.2%.    We remind investors that Makena became part of the company's portfolio following the acquisition of Lumara Health in Nov 2014. Since then Makena has been a significant sales driver for AMAG. Makena's estimated market share expanded to 42% in 2016 with two-third of Makena sales coming from the single-dose vials. In the upcoming quarters, AMAG anticipates an increase in sales of the product. Meanwhile, AMAG is developing an auto-injector device for subcutaneous administration of Makena (Makena SQ), including chemistry, manufacturing and controls development, in partnership with Antares Pharma, Inc. ATRS  as well. It is under review in the U.S. and has set a a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of Feb 14, 2018. If approved, Makena SQ auto-injector will ensure easier administration by healthcare providers and less painful injections for patients. Meanwhile, Feraheme continues to grow in both the hospital and hematology/oncology segments. In 2016, the company signed a large hospital group purchasing organizations (GPO) agreement which should broaden the company's access in large hospital segment and potentially increase its market share. Going forward, AMAG expects service revenues from the Cord Blood Registry (CBR) services (AMAG acquired CBR in Aug 2015) to contribute significantly to the company's top line due to continued efforts to increase new enrollments of cord blood and cord tissue units in storage facility, and recurring revenue from a growing base of stored units. Notably, AMAG has been pursuing strategic acquisitions and deals to boost its portfolio and pipeline. Evidently, the company added two products to its women's health portfolio in 2017-Rekynda and Intrarosa.  AMAG acquired exclusive U.S. rights to develop and commercialize Rekynda from Palatin Technologies, Inc. Rekynda is designed for the on-demand treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in pre-menopausal women. The company also bought the U.S. commercial rights to Endoceutics, Inc.'s drug, Intrarosa (prasterone), in February. Intrarosa was approved by the FDA to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) and is expected to be launched in the U.S. by this year.    As the company invests in the potential launch of Intrarosa and Makena subcutaneous auto-injector as well as label expansion for Feraheme, the costs of the company will rise which will hurt profits to an extent. Patent challenges for Feraheme might also remain an overhang.   AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus         AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and   Consensus    |      AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote   Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider  AMAG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in health care sector include Enzo Biochem, Inc. ENZ  and Sanofi SNY  . While Enzo Biochem sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Sanofi holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Enzo Biochem's loss per share estimates narrowed from 12 cents to 7 cents for 2017 and from 11 cents to 3 cents for 2018 over the last 30 days. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 55.83%. The share price of the company has increased 61.1% year to date. Sanofi's earnings per share estimates increased from $3.08 to $3.18 for 2017 and from $3.26 to $3.30 for 2018 over last 30 days. The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.10%. The share price of the company has increased 18.2% year to date.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

AMAG Pharmaceuticals Launches Intrarosa™ (prasterone) in the U.S. – a Novel Product to Treat Moderate to Severe Dyspareunia Due to Menopause

Intrarosa addresses an unmet need for women with moderate to severe dyspareunia, a common symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause Launch includes best-in-class copay savings program to help ensure swift and affordable access to Intrarosa for millions of women WALTHAM, Mass., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAG) today announced the commercial availability of Intrarosa™ (prasterone) at pharmacies nationwide, supported by a newly created 137-person women’s health sales force. Intrarosa is the first and only FDA-approved, local non-estrogen product for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. Intrarosa contains prasterone, an inactive precursor that is converted locally into estrogens and androgens with minimal systemic exposure.1,2 Intrarosa does not carry a boxed warning in its label and has no restrictions on duration of use. Nearly 32 million women (approximately half of all post-menopausal women in the United States) suffer from symptoms of VVA.3 Of those women, between 44 percent and 78 percent report symptoms of dyspareunia (pain during intercourse).4,5 According to patient survey data, more than half of women who report symptoms of dyspareunia are not currently being treated with a prescription therapy or seeking treatment.6,7 “Intrarosa addresses an important unmet medical need for the millions of women suffering from moderate to severe dyspareunia, many of whom are dissatisfied with their current treatment or are untreated due either to lack of awareness of the condition or safety concerns with current treatment options,”8 said Nik Grund, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at AMAG. “Ensuring the immediate accessibility and affordability of Intrarosa for patients who have been prescribed the therapy is a top priority for us at AMAG. Today we are also launching a comprehensive commercial copay savings program to help ensure that patients can gain immediate access to this novel therapy.” Through the Intrarosa Copay Savings Program, qualified commercially insured patients will receive their first prescription with a $0 copay and will pay no more than a $25 copay for each refill for the duration of the program. “The launch of Intrarosa demonstrates the rapid progress we are making in executing our corporate strategy to expand AMAG’s product portfolio with the development and commercialization of products with significant, long-term growth potential. Intrarosa extends our commitment to innovation in women’s healthcare and provides us with a unique opportunity to impact the lives of millions of women,” said William Heiden, president and chief executive officer at AMAG. About IntrarosaTM (prasterone)Intrarosa is a steroid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause. Intrarosa contains prasterone, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Prasterone is an inactive endogenous steroid, which is converted locally in the vagina into androgens and estrogens to help restore the vaginal tissue as indicated by improvements in the percentage of superficial cells, parabasal cells, pH and pain with intercourse. The mechanism of action is not fully established. Intrarosa is contraindicated in women with undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. Estrogen is a metabolite of prasterone. Use of exogenous estrogen is contraindicated in women with a known or suspected history of breast cancer. Intrarosa has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer. In four 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reaction with an incidence ≥ 2 percent was vaginal discharge. In one 52-week open-label clinical trial, the most common adverse reactions with an incidence ≥ 2 percent were vaginal discharge and abnormal Pap smear. Please see full Prescribing Information available at INTRAROSA.com About AMAGAMAG is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering important therapeutics, conducting clinical research in areas of unmet need and creating education and support programs for the patients and families we serve. Our currently marketed products support the health of patients in the areas of maternal and women’s health, anemia management and cancer supportive care.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
