Plug-O's















 


          i purchased both sizes. larger size fit a marmots EX well. smaller size fit in a vintage haynes (a rare bird, an open hole commercial model). they do the job, but i don't think they should be casually removed by someone like me who does not know their way around keys and pads.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in ID, I'd be happy to help.Learn More Your First Car InsuranceCongratulations on buying your first car! There's a lot of independence that comes with your very own ride. There's a lot to think about, too, like how much insurance you need and what you can afford. That's where I come in - I'm here to help you choose the coverage that fits your needs and your budget. I'll walk you through your options and let you know what Allstate discounts are available.Learn More Does Renters Insurance Cover a Laptop Computer or Mobile Device?You can be connected just about anywhere these days. You probably don't think much of checking your email in a coffee shop, walking around the office with your laptop computer or even watching a movie on your patio. Whether you're working at the kitchen table or finishing a project in the library, your laptop may go as many places as you do. But did you know that your renters insurance policy may be able to help if your laptop is stolen or damaged? Here are a few things to consider about protecting your laptop.Learn More Retirement & Life InsuranceYou've planned for your retirement so that you can afford what's important to you, whether it's travel, hobbies or time with the grandkids. But have you included life insurance in your planning, too? Retirement may affect your life insurance needs, from the cost of premiums on a new budget to how long you need a policy or if you need an emergency fund. Whether retirement is around the corner or you're already enjoying your new freedom, make sure you have a life insurance policy that will fit your needs during retirement.Learn More Is Your Office Rental Covered?Renting an office for your business makes sense - you have the space you need without the costs or maintenance of owning the building. But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office. Whether it's making sure your computers would be replaced or recouping potential losses after a disaster, let's talk about insuring your business before you sign that lease.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Renting A Motorhome?Whether it's for a weekend getaway or a summer touring the country, renting a motorhome can be a great way to travel. While you're researching the motorhome and rental company that are right for your trek, don't forget to look into insurance, too. Your current auto and homeowners policies may offer some coverage for a motorhome rental, but supplemental insurance can be a good idea. Here are the basics on what your policies may cover and why you might want to consider additional insurance before hitting the road.Learn More Fire Damage To Your CondoLiving in a condominium has its perks, especially if the condo board manages upkeep of the building. But you're still at risk when things go wrong in common areas or neighboring units, especially when it comes to a fire. The damage can be hard enough to deal with, but you could also be left wondering whose insurance will cover the costs of repairs and replacing your belongings. While you hopefully never experience a fire in or near your condo, it is important to be familiar with not only your condo insurance's fire coverage but also with the association's coverage.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Idaho Falls.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(208) 524-5129(208) 524-5129Mobile(208) 757-1815(208) 757-1815Fax(208) 524-2897(208) 524-2897Email:barbarabeck@allstate.combarbarabeck@allstate.comAddress:1280 S Woodruff AveIdaho Falls, ID 83404Get DirectionsLandmarks:We are located on the corner of 12th Street and Woodruff in the Colonial Plaza.Areas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Idaho Falls, Blackfoot, Rigby, Ammon, Rexburg, St Anthony, State of Idaho.

About Us
More than tickets, Vivid Seats…




















Vivid Seats was created out of a genuine love for attending live events…
We all feel the anticipation right after the lights go down. We remember the sounds of the orchestra pit tuning their instruments to deliver enchanting musical scores and standing ovations. We remember the blazing guitar solos, the last second scores, the come-from-behind wins, and the cheers of the fans. It's no accident we're named Vivid Seats…"vivid" comes from the Latin word "vivere" which means "to live"…and going to live events gives you the chance to live the music, live the culture, and live the glory that all generate the vivid memories and unique stories that will last a lifetime! 
Our Purpose
We know that the live event experience starts long before you step into the venue. From the moment you learn about the event, you start figuring out if you can go, who you want to go with, and where you want to sit. Those decisions are all part of what can make the experience great… or, on the other hand, a frustrating hassle. With this in mind, we created Vivid Seats to reinvent the ticket purchasing experience. We have the best tools in the industry for you to learn, shop, share, plan, and organize your live event experience. We continually invest in our site's functionality and information so that you can go from start-to-finish faster and easier than on any other ticket website. And we've worked hard to be the leader in providing value, uniquely combining discount prices with premium service. Simply put, we want you to be able to go to as many live events as possible, and we want to provide the best experience in the industry!
Our Guarantee
We also know that buying tickets requires trust—nobody wants to get ripped off and no one wants to worry about their tickets. That's why we designed our site to be the safest, most secure way to buy tickets online. We never pass along your personal information to the seller, and we back all orders with our 100% Buyer Guarantee. While many of our competitors let just about anyone sell a ticket without sticking around to help, our service covers the rigorous screening process we apply to all the sellers on our website and supports our dedicated, in-house customer service team. We are there to protect and help you all along the way. We invest in the process and infrastructure so that you can purchase tickets worry-free. 
 Our Commitment
We are committed to earning your satisfaction with every order. We have the most responsive customer service team in the industry with decades of professional experience satisfying our thousands of loyal customers and corporate clients. We are here to help you from start to finish…any time…all the time. Getting the right seats at the right price in a fast-moving market requires skilled, efficient, professional coordination. Our full service staff is there to do just that—fully dedicated to giving you the best ticket buying experience in the industry!
As the gateway to your spectacular and memorable live event experiences, we want you to look forward to your upcoming concert, show, or game with confidence, peace of mind, and genuine happiness and excitement, every step of the way. Vivid Seats is your ticket to live events!
Jerry and Eric, Founders
