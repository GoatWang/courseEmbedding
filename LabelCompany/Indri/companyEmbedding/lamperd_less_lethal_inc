Lamperd Less Lethal, Inc. Announces Successful Expansion of Its Product Lines | Business Wire


























































Lamperd Less Lethal, Inc. Announces Successful Expansion of Its 
      Product Lines






February 25, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SARNIA, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lamperd Less Lethal (PINKSHEETS: LLLI) has begun the manufacturing of 
      the 350 Ultra -Light 40MM Single- Shot Grenade Launcher ordered by the 
      Canadian federal government. With the orders in house to be built, the 
      company will have more revenue in the next few weeks than in any year in 
      the last five years.
    

      As a result of conversations with, and a plant visit by a large military 
      force, Lamperd has researched, engineered, designed, manufactured and 
      tested a 37/38/40 MM five shot magazine grenade launcher weighing 5.4 
      pounds that worked perfectly in range testing. As a comparison, most 
      launchers in the market weigh nine pounds or more. The product will be 
      available for order fulfillment in early Spring 2014.
    

      After several visits and demonstrations, the disbursement officer of a 
      foreign country has requested a representative from the company to 
      return and finalize what the company expects to be the largest purchase 
      order in company history from this overseas government. Additional 
      distributor interest has also been expressed as representatives from 
      Mexico and Europe visited the Lamperd plant on February 21, 2014 for 
      another round of highly successful demonstrations and testing.
    

      These new single and multi shot launchers have stirred considerable 
      interest in the world-wide less lethal market. Several national 
      governments, armed forces personnel, police and security agencies from 
      around the world have contacted Lamperd with great interest in the new 
      product line. Interest has been expressed in potential orders ranging 
      from a few dozen to a thousand or more units. These additional orders re 
      expected over the next several weeks and could put the company firmly on 
      the road to profitability.
    

      The company is working diligently on its product development and sales/ 
      marketing plans with an eye on profitability in the near term. It may be 
      in the best interest of investors and shareholders to actively watch the 
      companies’ progress through these crucial developments.
    

About the Company

SARNIA, Ontario, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lamperd Less Lethal, Inc. (OTC:LLLI), an innovation leader in the development of advanced security products and crowd control systems, will host an introduction and display event on Thursday, October 5, 2017 at Lambton College, near the company's headquarters in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada.  We will be featuring our latest invention, the Aerial Burst Pepper Spray Grenade, which has the following features:
No harmful fallout. 
Only weighs 1.5 ounces.
Completely controls everyone within 200 square feet for 20 minutes.
We believe that this is the Public Order product of the future to control large crowds and riots up to hundreds of people.  
Lamperd is the only manufacturer of this product.
Once this product catches on with police and military forces, we believe we will have to greatly expand our manufacturing facilities to keep up with demand.
We are anticipating that Homeland Security agencies, around the world, will get interested in this product.
This is the Public Order product of the future.  It is extremely unique and there is no other product like it anywhere in the world.  
With this product, there should be no need for any police force in the world to be exposed to the risk of situations such as the occurrences at the G20 Summit in Germany, when civil defense products such as this are available.
