New York Life


As with most other things in life, a key to achieving your long-term financial objectives is planning. Your goal may be to fund your children’s college education, protect your family during your working years, or guarantee your own retirement security. These things won’t happen by accident. It’s important to determine what you’d like to achieve financially and then map out a strategy that will help you meet those goals. The good news is that it’s never too late to start.

Of course, planning your financial future can be intimidating. Luckily, you don't have to do it alone. As a New York Life insurance agent, and a Registered Representative of NYLIFE Securities LLC, I am a trained professional who can help you identify your financial needs and then determine which insurance and financial products can best help you meet your objectives.

Life Insurance: Life insurance is an effective way to help protect your family's lifestyle and future. Plus the cash value in a whole life insurance policy can be accessed via policy loans and partial surrenders can be used to help you supplement your retirement income.  This cash value can also be accessed and used for other major life events and can play an important part in estate, business succession, or charitable giving plans.*
Long-Term Care Insurance:  Going through life may require a little help along the way.  So if you're planning ahead, long-term care insurance may help protect you or a family member's future plans and help preserve the assets you've worked so hard to build. 
Retirement Income: Preparing for retirement is easier with the help of our guaranteed^ lifetime income annuity products. You can select an immediate annuity1 that pays income right away, or a tax-deferred fixed annuity1 that allows you to set aside money until you need it. Either way, you will be assured a steady, dependable source of income for life. 
Other Products: We have established relationships with other carriers, and can supply you with information on disability income insurance as well as individual and group health insurance products.2 If we don't offer it, chances are we can assist you.
To learn more about our products and services, please feel free to give me a call or request a free consultation.  I'll be happy to answer all your questions. 


		^Guarantees are backed by the claims paying ability of the issuer.

		1New York Life fixed annuities are Issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (A Delaware Corporation)

		2Products available through one or more carriers not affiliated with New York Life; dependent on carrier authorization and product availability in your state or locality.

		*Loans accrue interest and both loans and partial surrenders will reduce cash value and death benefit if not paid back.

NVSPBind - temporarily unavailable 

Quick note as I’ve been inundated with emails saying that NVSPBind is not available for download as of a week or so back.

Recent Articles, Pamphlets, and Dissertations in Indiana History
Editor's Note. This list of articles, pamphlets, and dissertations
                    published in 1981 and 1982 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the Indiana Magazine of
                        History. We recognize that the list is neither complete nor systematic in coverage, and we
                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but are
                    not normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of
                    local historical society activities (which are reported in the Indiana History
                    Bulletin), but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for
                    the March, 1984, issue must be received by December 1, 1983. Many people have contributed to the
                    present list, but major responsibility has rested with Robert G. Barrows of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau and Gary L. Bailey of the Indiana Magazine of History.

Recent Articles, Pamphlets, and Dissertations in Indiana History
Editor's Note. This list of articles, pamphlets, and dissertations
                    published in 1981 and 1982 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the Indiana Magazine of
                        History. We recognize that the list is neither complete nor systematic in coverage, and we
                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but are
                    not normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of
                    local historical society activities (which are reported in the Indiana History
                    Bulletin), but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for
                    the March, 1984, issue must be received by December 1, 1983. Many people have contributed to the
                    present list, but major responsibility has rested with Robert G. Barrows of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau and Gary L. Bailey of the Indiana Magazine of History.
