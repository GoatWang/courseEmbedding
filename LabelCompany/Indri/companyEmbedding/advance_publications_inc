Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Publications[edit]
Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Publications[edit]
Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Publications[edit]
Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

Choosing an Interior Paint Sheen
Sheen refers to paint's shininess. When deciding on paint sheen, consider the condition of the wall and whether the area is high/low traffic. Here's a partial list to get started:

Flat or matte sheen provides great depth of color and is ideal for less-than-perfect surfaces.
Eggshell, pearl and satin sheens are light, easy to clean, work great in high traffic areas, and reveal color with a softly polished glow.
Semi-gloss sheens are particularly durable and are often recommended for moldings and trim.

Choosing an Exterior Paint Sheen
Our super-premium products offer the same durability and washability in all sheens, so the selection of the finish is more of a personal preference. But here are a few things to remember:

Flat is good at hiding surface imperfections and delivers beautiful color.
Satin stays cleaner and stands up to abrasion better than Flat.
Semi-Gloss is more moisture resistant and easier to clean.
High-Gloss allows rich, deep color but magnifies surface imperfections.

Choosing a Stain Finish
Stain opacity levels range from clear to solid, with the amount of pigment in a stain determining its opacity. Translucent, Semi-Transparent, and Semi-Solid Stains are designed to protect without completely obscuring the natural color and texture of wood. As the opacity moves towards solid, less grain shows through the finish. In contrast, solid stains will completely mask the wood grain, while allowing the wood texture to show through, and the greater its protection will be over time.
What is VOC?
VOC means Volatile Organic Compounds. The paint industry is filled with definitions of what "green paint" is. Other manufacturers use tints that add VOCs to their paints, but Benjamin Moore's waterborne tinting technology ensures that our paints retain their low - or zero-VOC properties.
Green Promise®
Benjamin Moore's Green Promise® designation is our assurance that the product is environmentally-friendly and meets - and often exceeds - the strictest industry standards, while also delivering the premium levels of performance you expect from Benjamin Moore.
