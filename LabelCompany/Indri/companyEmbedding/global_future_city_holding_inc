Launches New Product DivisionAccesswireAugust 26, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareIRVINE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 26, 2015 / Global Future City Holding, Inc. (OTCQB: FTCY) announced a change in its future business plans today. FTCY has previously focused upon integrating the crypto-asset, E-Gold ("EGD"), into its business plan by requesting a no-action position by the Securities Exchange Commission. FTCY's management has not received any response, and this, coupled with the difficulty in securing financial reporting conclusions associated with crypto-assets, has led management to elect to rescind the previous contribution of EGD and to focus upon the acquisition of GX-Life Global.GX-Life Global has developed a robust, scalable platform to support multi-level marketing opportunities throughout the world. This platform, coupled with its complement of over 25 consumer products to initially be marketed through the multi-level marketing platform is intended to replace FTCY's previous interest in EGD. FTCY is presently considering the role that crypto-assets may play in its new business plan and anticipates incorporating such a plan; however, the plan would likely include utilizing a registered trading crypto-asset currency other than EGD.Ning Liu, CEO & President of FTCY remarked, "while we are frustrated with the uncertainty associated with the new introduction of crypto-assets into the world economy, we believe that our shift in focus from EGD to our new plans provide greater certainty and near-term financial benefits to FTCY." In the meantime, FTCY will continue to focus on implementing its EB-5 immigrant investor program for foreign investors who are interested in acquiring lawful permanent residence in the United States. As a result of the recent acquisition of a designated EB-5 regional center approved by the USCIS ("EB-5 Subsidiary"), FTCY intends to focus its initial efforts on acquiring qualified investment projects that are aligned with the recently acquired EB-5 Subsidiary.About Global Future City Holding Inc.Global Future City Holding Inc. is a holding company focused on implementing an EB-5 immigrant investor program for foreign investors who are interested in acquiring lawful permanent residence in the United States, and the marketing and deployment of its MLM loyalty-based retail program. The Company plans to focus its initial efforts on acquiring qualified investment projects that are aligned with the recently acquired EB-5 Regional Center and launching the MLM program with a potential registered digital currency.Information about Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains "forward-looking statements" that include information relating to future events and future financial and operating performance.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
