(1) All the proceeds from this offering will be held in trust and all the
    offering expenses have been or will be funded from loans made to us by BCM.
    BCM has agreed to make loans to us from time to time as these expenses are
    incurred. These loans will be repaid upon the consummation of our initial
    business transaction. All these loans will be due and payable upon the
    completion of our initial business transaction and will be on terms that
    waive any and all rights to the funds in the trust account.  

(2) After this offering and prior to our initial business transaction, all
    expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business,
    negotiating an acquisition agreement and consummating such acquisition and
    our other working capital requirements will be funded by loans provided to
    us from BCM and interest earned on the funds in the trust account. BCM has
    agreed to loan us funds from time to time of up to $800,000. All of these
    loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial business
    transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights to the funds 
    in the trust account. We anticipate that approximately $26,005 (including
    taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to us, from interest
    income to be earned on the funds held in the trust account. The estimated
    interest earned on funds held in the trust account is based on what believe
    to be a conservative interest rate of 0.05% per annum following this 
    offering generated from the funds in the trust account. During the six 
    month period ended January 31, 2012, U.S. Treasury Bills with six month 
    maturities were yielding approximately 0.05% per annum. The 0.05% assumed 
    interest rate has been applied for the purpose of the above calculation 
    because we believe it represents a conservative estimate calculated based 
    on the above described yields. While we cannot assure you the balance of 
    the trust account will be invested to yield these rates, we believe such 
    rates are representative of those we may receive on the balance of the 
    trust account. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to 
    us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately 
    following the offering. The amounts set forth above are estimates and may 
    differ materially from our actual expenses.  

All the proceeds from this offering of $25,000,000 (or $28,750,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be deposited 
into the trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A., maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. All of the expenses 
associated with this offering (estimated at $300,000) have been or will be 
funded to us by BCM through non-interest bearing loans. Following the 
consummation of this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial 
business transaction, in order to fund all expenses relating to investigating 
and selecting a target business, negotiating an acquisition agreement and 
consummating such acquisition and our other working capital requirements, 
BCM has agreed to loan us funds from time to time of up to $800,000. All 
these loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial 
business transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights 
to the funds in the trust account. 

None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, 
other than any interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we 
need to pay our income or other tax obligations, any remaining interest that 
we need for our working capital requirements, until the earlier of (i) the 
consummation of a business transaction, (ii) our redemption of the public 
shares sold in this offering if we are unable to consummate a business 
transaction within 24 months from the date of effectiveness of the 
registration statement, or (iii) our liquidation (if no redemption occurs). 
The proceeds held in the trust account (net of taxes and amounts released to 
us for working capital purposes) may be used as consideration to pay the 
sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
transaction or, if there are insufficient funds, to pay other expenses 
relating to such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for 
out-of-pocket expenses, third party due diligence expenses or potential 
finders’ fees, in each case only upon the consummation of a business 
transaction. In the event there are funds remaining in the trust account 
after satisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be used to 
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, 
as determined by our board of directors at that time. All amounts held in 
the trust account will be released to us on the closing of our initial 
business transaction. 

We intend to use proceeds from loans provided to us from BCM, and interest 
earned on the funds in the trust account which we are permitted to withdraw 
for working capital purposes for due diligence, legal, accounting, fees and 
expenses of the acquisition, including investment banking fees, and other 
expenses, including structuring and negotiating a business transaction, as 
well as a possible down payment, reverse break up fees (a provision which 
requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition 
is not obtained), lock-up or “no-shop” provision (a provision designed to 
keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other 
companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses), if necessary. 
While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down 
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular 
proposed business transaction, if we were to enter into such an agreement 
where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, 
the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” 
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business 
transaction and the amount of our available funds at the time. In addition 
to the use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these 
funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target 
business. 

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with 
a business transaction, either because the consideration for our business 
transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or the issuance 
of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds not expended will be used 
to finance our operations, which may include the target business(es) that we 
acquire in our business transaction, to effect other acquisitions, or for 
expenses, as determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use 
these funds, among other things, for director and officer compensation, 
change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the 
operations of the target business, to make other acquisitions and to pursue 
our growth strategy. 

To the extent that our capital stock or the issuance of our debt securities 
are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
transaction, or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, 
in whole or in part, as consideration to effect a business transaction, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate 
a business transaction will be disbursed to the combined company and will, 
along with any other interest earned on the funds held in the trust account 
not expended, be used to finance our operations. In the event that third 
party indebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors will 
not be personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness. 

On February 10, 2012 and March 5, 2012, we entered into loan payable 
agreements for approximately $15,000 each with BCM. The loans are payable
upon the consummation of our initial business transaction, bear no interest 
and contain a waiver of any and all rights to the funds in the trust account 
resulting from the consummation of this offering. Accordingly, the loans 
will become worthless and will not be repaid unless and until the 
consummation of our initial business transaction. In addition, we expect to 
enter into further loans with BCM to fund our expenses described in this 
prospectus. 

All of the expenses associated with this offering (estimated at $300,000) 
have been or will be funded to us by BCM through non-interest bearing loans. 
Following the consummation of this offering and prior to the consummation of 
our initial business transaction, in order to fund all expenses relating to 
investigating and selecting a target business, negotiating an acquisition 
agreement and consummating such acquisition and our other working capital 
requirements, BCM has agreed to loan us funds of up to $800,000. All these 
loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial business 
transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights to the funds 
in the trust account. 

The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account 
agent only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 180 days or less 
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the 
Investment Company Act. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to 
these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company 
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. 

In no event will any of our initial stockholders, officers or directors, 
or any of our or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, 
consulting fee or any other form of compensation, prior to, or for any 
services they render in connection with, the consummation of a business 
transaction. However, upon the closing of our initial business transaction, 
our board of directors will have the sole discretion to determine the number 
of initial shares to be forfeit by each of our initial stockholders, based 
on the degree of participation of our initial stockholders in activities 
relating to the initial business transaction. As a result, certain of our 
initial stockholders may forfeit a lesser number of their initial shares than 
other initial stockholders if our board of directors determines that such 
individuals played a more prominent role in identifying, evaluating and 
closing a business transaction. However, our initial stockholders, officers 
or directors will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our 
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business 
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business transactions. 
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of related party 
loans and interest earned on the trust account and currently allocated in 
the above table to “Legal and accounting expenses attendant to the due 
diligence investigations, structuring and negotiations of a business 
transaction,” “Due diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) 
of prospective targets,” “Legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting
obligations,” and “Other miscellaneous expenses.” There is no limit on the 
amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us (except that reimbursement
may not be made using funds in the trust account unless and until a business 
transaction is consummated). Since the role of present management after 
a business transaction is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
transaction. 

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust 
account only upon the earlier to occur of (i) our redemption of our public 
shares for a per share pro rata portion of the trust account (including 
interest but net of any taxes amounts released to us for working capital 
purposes, subject to applicable law), or (ii) our liquidation (if redemption 
does not occur). In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right 
or interest of any kind in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial
business transaction, we may encounter intense competition from other 
entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank 
check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and 
operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities 
are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting 
business transactions directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these 
competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources 
than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by 
our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an 
advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. These factors may 
place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our 
initial business transaction.


Company Description
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring, through 
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, 
reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business 
transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet


 
identified. To date, we have not conducted any active operations since 
inception. We have not conducted any search activities, and we do not have 
any specific initial business transaction under consideration or discussion 
as of the date of this prospectus. Furthermore, we do not intend to commence 
any activities relating to our initial business transaction until Committed 
Capital Acquisition Corporation, a company affiliated with our officers and
directors and certain of our initial stockholders, completes its initial 
business transaction or, alternatively, until Committed Capital Acquisition 
Corporation is liquidated or its public shares are redeemed. 

Except as discussed below, we are not limited to a particular industry, 
geographic region or minimum transaction value for purposes of consummating 
our initial business transaction, although we intend to initially focus on 
operating businesses within the United States having a fair market value 
less than $200,000,000 at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in 
connection with our initial business transaction. Simultaneous with our 
formation, our initial stockholders formed CCAC3, a blank check company that 
will initially focus on operating businesses within the United States having 
a fair market value greater than $200,000,000 at the time of signing 
a definitive agreement in connection with its initial business transaction.
It is anticipated that the initial public offering of CCAC3 will coincide 
with this offering and our officers and directors will be the officers and 
directors of CCAC3. Until CCAC3 signs a definitive agreement in respect of 
its initial business transaction, we will only seek a target business that 
has a fair market value less than $200,000,000 at the time of our signing 
a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business transaction. 
However, even during such time period, we will be able to pursue an initial 
business transaction with a target company having a fair market value greater 
than $200,000,000 if such transaction is rejected by the board of directors
of CCAC3. Furthermore, although it is not our intent, we are not prohibited 
from partnering with CCAC3 to submit a joint bid for an initial business 
transaction. 

We will seek to capitalize on more than 55 years of combined transaction and 
investing experience of our management team: Michael Rapp, our co-founder, 
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Philip Wagenheim, our co-founder, 
President, Secretary and director. Our management team has been involved in 
more than 65 transactions ranging from financing activities to advisory 
engagements, including experience in managing Committed Capital Acquisition 
Corporation. In addition, Messrs. Rapp and Wagenheim are the founders of BCM,
a boutique investment bank and broker-dealer, which has arranged financings, 
provided advisory services for, invested in, and has held interests in 
a diverse portfolio of high-growth companies. BCM has led numerous initial 
public offerings and private placements and has also specialized in providing 
its clients solutions with regard to accessing the capital markets through 
non-traditional methods such as SPACs and reverse mergers. Prior to forming 
BCM, Messrs. Rapp and Wagenheim were managing directors and founders of Oscar
Gruss & Son Incorporated's private client group. 

Our initial stockholders also include: P&P 2, LLC, Michael Serruya, SilkRoad 
Equity, LLC, Delavaco Capital, Inc. and Committed Capital Holdings II LLC. As
of the date of this prospectus, (i) each of P&P 2, LLC, Michael Serruya, Silk 
Road Equity, LLC and Delavaco Capital, Inc. will beneficially own 1,000,000 
initial shares, and (ii) Committed Capital Holdings II LLC will own 450,000 
initial shares. All such initial shares will be subject to forfeiture as 
described in this prospectus. These initial stockholders do not have 
a contractual or fiduciary obligation to assist in the identification of 
potential candidates for our initial business transaction or present business 
opportunities to us. Mr. Rapp is the managing member of Committed Capital 
Holdings II LLC. 

While we intend to utilize the criteria listed below in evaluating business 
transaction opportunities, we expect that no individual criterion will 
entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity. Further, 
any particular business transaction opportunity which we ultimately determine 
to pursue may not meet one or more of these criteria: 

. Fair Market Value of Less than $200 Million. We intend to initially focus on 
  target businesses that have a fair market value less than $200,000,000 at the time 
  of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business 
  transaction.  
 
. Domestic U.S. Business.  We will seek to acquire a business that is
  focused primarily on doing business in and is headquartered in the United
  States. However, we will consider acquiring businesses domiciled overseas or
  with significant operations overseas if those businesses meet a significant
  portion of our other investment criteria.  

. Established Companies with Proven Track Records. We will seek to acquire
  established companies with sound historical financial performance. We intend
  to focus our search for acquisition targets on companies with a history of
  strong operating and financial results. We do not intend to acquire start-up
  companies with a limited history of operations.  

. Companies with Strong Free Cash Flow Characteristics.  We will seek to
  acquire companies that have a history of strong, stable free cash flow
  generation (i.e. companies that typically generate cash in excess of that
  required to maintain or expand the business’s asset base). 

. Strong Industry Position. We will seek to acquire businesses that operate 
  within industries that have strong fundamentals. The factors we will consider 
  include growth prospects, competitive dynamics, level of consolidation, need 
  for capital investment and barriers to entry.

. Competitive Barriers.  We will seek to acquire businesses that demonstrate 
  advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to protect their
  market position and profitability, and deliver strong free cash flow. Factors 
  that we will consider include the strengths and weaknesses of target 
  businesses relative to their competitors with regard to product quality, 
  customer loyalty, cost impediments associated with customers switching to 
  competitors, patent protection and brand positioning.  

. Experienced Management Team. We will seek to acquire businesses that have 
  strong, experienced management teams. We will focus on management teams with 
  a proven track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing profitability
  and generating strong free cash flow. We believe that the operating expertise
  of our officers and directors will complement, not replace, the target’s
  management team.  

. Diversified Customer and Supplier Base. We will seek to acquire businesses 
  that have a diversified customer and supplier base. Companies with a 
  diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure
  economic downturns, industry consolidation, changing business preferences and
  other factors that may negatively impact their customers, suppliers and
  competitors.  

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to 
the merits of a particular initial business transaction may be based, to the 
extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations,
factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

NEW YORK, July 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Committed Capital Acquisition Corporation II (the "Company") (OTC Pink: CCAQ), a blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses or assets, announced the commencement of its second redemption and procedures on July 10, 2017 as more fully described in that certain current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March 31. 2017.  The Company does not intend to send any further documents to its shareholders regarding the July Redemption (as defined below) and current stockholders should carefully review this press release and the current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof for information regarding the July Redemption.








April Redemption
On April 10, 2017, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders at which time the Company's stockholders approved an extension of the time that the Company has to close a business transaction until April 10, 2019 (the "Extension Amendment") and, in connection therewith, allowed holders of the Company's public shares to redeem their public shares (the "April Redemption"), and also provided for a second redemption opportunity beginning July 10, 2017 (the "July Redemption"), in each case for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account established by the Company with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") in connection with the Company's 2014 initial public offering of its securities (the "IPO").
In connection with the April Redemption, 2,042,244 of the 2,394,071 shares that were eligible for redemption were redeemed for a total of $10,211,220.
July Redemption
The Company is now offering remaining holders of the public shares issued in connection with its IPO the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with the July Redemption.  
Redemption Procedure
A request for redemption may be made on or before August 11, 2017 by ensuring your bank or broker complies with the requirements identified herein.
Stockholders (or "you") must elect either to physically tender your stock certificates to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 17 Battery Place, New York, New York 10004, Attn: Mark Zimkind; mzimkind@continentalstock.com, by August 11, 2017 or to deliver your shares to the Transfer Agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, which election would be determined based on the manner in which you hold your shares. The election is irrevocable upon the conclusion of the July Redemption.
Through the DWAC system, this electronic delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, regardless of whether it is a record holder or its shares are held in "street name," by contacting the Transfer Agent or its broker and requesting delivery of its shares through the DWAC system. Delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The Transfer Agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. It is the Company's understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the Transfer Agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. Such stockholders will have less time to make their investment decision than those stockholders that do not elect to exercise their redemption rights. Stockholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.
Certificates and/or shares that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures by August 11, 2017 will not be redeemed for cash. In the event that a public stockholder requests redemption and decides prior to the close of the redemption period that it does not want to redeem its shares, the stockholder may withdraw the request. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to August 11, 2017 not to redeem your shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at address listed above. 
The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the July Redemption would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after August 11, 2017. The Company will hold the certificates of public stockholders that request redemption and deliver prior to August 11, 2017 until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such stockholders.
If properly demanded, the Company will redeem each public share for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account. As of July 10, 2017, this would amount to approximately $5.00 per share. If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your shares of the Company's public shares for cash and will no longer own the shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption, and tender your stock certificate(s) or electronically transfer your shares to the Company's transfer agent by August 11, 2017.

In connection with the vote on the Extension Amendment, stockholders redeemed approximately 5.6 million shares, valued at approximately $28 million.
