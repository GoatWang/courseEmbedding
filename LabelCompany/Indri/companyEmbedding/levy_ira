5.11.6.1 
                                (01-17-2017)Retirement Income
                           







Use discretion in determining if retirement income should be levied. For more information on pre-levy consideration, see IRM
                              5.11.1.3.1,Pre-Levy Considerations. See IRM 1.2.44.4, Delegation Order 5-3 (Rev-1), which outlines the authority to levy on property in the hands of a third
                              party (not to include Levy Form 668-B, Levy).
                           


A notice of levy is continuous for wages and salary. Other levies only reach property a third party is holding when the levy
                              is received. 
                           

Reminder:
References to property include rights to property.



As long as the taxpayer has a fixed and determinable right to property, a levy attaches that right. Therefore, a levy on retirement
                              income can reach payments in the future whether or not the taxpayer has begun receiving payments when the levy is served.
                              This often means that a levy on retirement income reaches future payments. Because this type of levy may begin attaching payments
                              long after the levy is served, follow-up when the taxpayer is expected to become eligible to receive payments. Also see IRM
                              5.11.5.6.2(6) Systemic Monitoring of Continuous Levy Payments regarding input of transaction code (TC) 971 action code (AC) 687 and IRM 5.11.7.2.5.1, FPLP and Paper Levy (Form 668-A/668-W), for discussion regarding the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) and paper levies. Consider setting a mandatory follow-up
                              for Bal Due accounts reported currently not collectible.
                           


If the taxpayer has the right to receive future payment but has not opted to do so, the levy attaches that right.


A levy served while the taxpayer is receiving periodic payments reaches payments due then, as well as payments as they become
                              due later, as long as there is already a fixed and determinable right to the future payments.
                           


 A levy on a fixed and determinable right to receive future payment (e.g., retirement or pension income, Social Security benefits),
                              made within the statutory period for collection, remains enforceable to the extent of the value of the property levied even
                              if the property itself is not turned over within the statutory period for collection. In other words, a levy prior to the
                              expiration of the statutory period for collection on a fixed and determinable right to receive future payment is still enforceable
                              after the expiration of the statutory period for collection.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes payments for: 



Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and


Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI).




Note:
Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) is used interchangeably with RSDI.



RSDI (or OASDI) is based on social security taxes during a person's working years. RSDI (or OASDI) payments are not based
                                 on need, and they can be levied. SSI payments are for elderly, blind, or disabled persons. The IRC 6334(a)(11) exempts from
                                 levy certain public assistance payments, including supplemental security income under XVI of the Social Security Act. For
                                 more information on pre-levy considerations, see IRM 5.11.1.3.1,Pre-Levy Considerations.

Note:
RSDI (or OASDI) payments are also subject to levy under FPLP. Although IRC 6331(h) permits the service to levy on up to 15
                                    percent of SSI payments, the Service will not pursue these levy sources at this time. For further details of FPLP see IRM
                                    5.11.7.2.1.1, IRS/BFS Interagency Agreement - Federal Payments Subject to the FPLP .also see IRM 5.11.7.2.5.1,  FPLP or Paper Levy (Form
                                          668-A/668-W). 



Use discretion in determining whether a levy on Social Security benefits is appropriate under the circumstances. Generally
                                 if other viable levy sources are available these sources should be considered  prior to a levy on Social Security benefits.
                                 For more information on pre-levy considerations, see IRM 5.11.1.3.1, Pre-Levy Considerations.
                              

Note:
Social Security benefits are not community property and a levy can’t be served on the nonliable spouse’s social security payment
                                    under the theory that it is community property. See IRM 25.18.1.2.29(1), Federal Preemption of State Community Property Characterization.



Send Part 1 of Form 668–W(ICS) or 668-W(c)(DO) to the SSA office that issued the taxpayer's social security number. The taxpayer
                                 is allowed to claim the exemption from levy per IRC 6334(a)(9) and to provide SSA with their Statement of Exemptions and Filing
                                 Status. See the Servicewide Electronic Research Program (SERP), Who/Where, Levy Source Information for SSA office addresses
                                 https://acsweb.enterprise.irs.gov/nlsweb/pages/nl08.xhtml. Include Notice 484, Instructions to Employer with Centralized Payroll
                                 System for Processing Statement of Exemptions and Filing Status. Send the other parts of the levy to the taxpayer with Notice
                                 483, Instructions to Employee Paid Through a Centralized Payroll System for Submitting Statement of Exemptions and Filing
                                 Status. Make appropriate changes to Notice 483 and Notice 484.
                              


 Once a levy is served, SSA will continue honoring it, until the levy is released. However, the taxpayer's eligibility for
                                 benefits could change. A change in benefits might stop the levy proceeds. If this happens, SSA will notify the office that
                                 issued the levy not to expect more payments. However, SSA is not allowed to explain why because privacy laws restrict to whom
                                 SSA can disclose benefit information. 
                              

Example:
The taxpayer may get full benefits when the levy is served. Later, the person starts working. This may reduce the benefits
                                    to less than the exempt amount, so there will be no levy proceeds. If the person stops working and gets full benefits again,
                                    SSA will not automatically start sending levy payments. A new levy must be served.
                                 


Note:
RSDI (or OASDI) payments are alternatively levied at 15 percent via the FPLP. Per IRM 5.11.7.2.2.2(2), Exclusions the FPLP will systemically release the FPLP levy prior to the expiration of the statutory period for collection; however,
                                    a paper levy will continue to be honored until a levy release is issued. 
                                 


Note:
Beginning January, 2007, SSA submits paper levy payments to IRS through the Electronic Funds Transfer Payment System (EFTPS).
                                    These payments post to IDRS as TC 670 designated payment code (DPC) 05 but are identifiable by the presence and content of
                                    an EFT-TRACE-NUM field.  All SSA levy payments have values of “49” in the third and fourth positions of the EFT-TRACE-NUM.
                                    
                                 



A representative payee; such as a caretaker, guardian or trustee, may be designated to receive benefits on behalf of a beneficiary.
                                 Benefits payable to such a representative payee are not the property of the representative payee and are not available for
                                 levy relating to the representative payee’s tax liabilities.

Expect the first payment in two to three months. See IRM 5.11.6.1.2(2) above.
                              


Civil service retirement payments can also be levied at 15 percent via the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP). FPLP will
                                 systemically release the FPLP levy within 90 days prior to the expiration of the statutory period for collection. See IRM
                                 5.11.7.2.1.1, IRS/BFS Interagency Agreement - Federal Payments Subject to FPLP. A paper levy will continue to be honored until a levy release is issued. See IRM 5.11.5.6.2 (6) for systemic monitoring
                                 instructions. Also see IRM 5.11.7.2.5.1, FPLP or Paper Levy (Form 668-A/668-W).

Certain annuity and pension payments are exempt from levy. See IRC 6334.


The payments exempt from levy include: 



Railroad Retirement and Unemployment


Special Pensions for Medal of Honor Winners


Annuities under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan and Survivor Benefit Plan





 Revenue officers will not pursue paper levy of railroad retirement and railroad unemployment payments at this time. IRM 6331(h)
                                 permits the Service to levy on up to 15 percent of railroad retirement and railroad unemployment payments. FPLP implemented
                                 the 15 percent levy on Railroad Retirement Board benefits since July 2011. See IRM 5.11.7.2.1.1 (2)(i) IRS/BFS Interagency Agreement - Federal Payments Subject to the FPLP.

These instructions cover assets accumulated in a pension or retirement plan, as well as Individual Retirement Arrangements
                              (IRAs). They do not deal with levying retirement income. See section IRM 5.11.6.1 above. Also see Delegation Order 5-3 (Rev-1) at IRM 1.2.44.4 (23)c and IRM 5.17.3.9.19Pension and Retirement Benefits.


There are many employer and self-sponsored retirement vehicles that are not exempt from levy. These plans include, for example:
                              
                           



Qualified Pension, Profit Sharing, and Stock Bonus Plans under ERISA


IRAs


Retirement Plans for the Self-Employed (such as SEP-IRAs and Keogh Plans) 





Because these retirement vehicles provide for the taxpayer's future welfare, levy on the assets in a retirement account (as
                              contrasted with income from the account) only after following the procedures set forth below. If the taxpayer provides a written
                              request to the Service to levy the assets in the retirement account, we should consider the taxpayer's request to levy the
                              account as part of the ability to pay determination. Prior to levying pursuant to the taxpayer’s request, follow step 1 as
                              described in paragraph (4) (consider alternatives to levy on retirement assets) and step 3 as described in paragraph (7) (determine
                              whether the taxpayer needs the retirement assets for necessary living expenses). Document the case history and levy approval
                              memo that the taxpayer requested the IRS to issue the levy; do not make the flagrant conduct determination in step 2 as described
                              in paragraphs (5) and (6) below. Follow guidance in IRM 5.15.1.27,Retirement or Profit Sharing Plans.

Note:
 If the taxpayer requests the levy and you decide that the Service should levy after following steps 1 and 3 in paragraphs
                                 (4) and (7), respectively, before issuing the levy, verify that the taxpayer has received CDP rights. If the taxpayer has
                                 not received CDP rights, then follow the procedures in IRM 5.11.1.3.3,
                              

Satisfying the Notice Requirements.

Note:
An imminent collection statute expiration date (CSED), alone, does not justify levying on retirement assets. Levying on assets
                                 in retirement accounts requires application of the procedures set forth below.
                              



The first step in deciding whether to levy on a retirement account is to determine what property, retirement assets and non-retirement
                              assets, is available to collect the liability. If there is property other than retirement assets that can be used to collect
                              the liability, or if a payment agreement can be reached, consider these alternatives before issuing a levy on retirement accounts.
                              Also consider the expense of pursuing other assets as well as the amount to be collected. Levy determinations are made on
                              a case-by-case basis and Revenue Officers must exercise good judgment in making the determination to levy. See IRM 5.11.1.3.1,
                              Pre-Levy Considerations. Document the case history with the determinations made in steps (4) through (7) below. Additionally, levying on assets in
                              retirement accounts requires application of the following procedures.
                           


The second step in deciding whether to levy on a retirement account is to determine whether the taxpayer's conduct has been
                              flagrant. If the taxpayer has not engaged in flagrant conduct, do not levy on retirement accounts. Deciding whether the taxpayer
                              has engaged in flagrant conduct must be done on a case-by-case basis. Keep in mind, however, extenuating circumstances may exist that mitigate the taxpayer's flagrant conduct. See IRM 5.1.10.3.2(9)(b).
                           

Example:
Extenuating circumstances are at times situations beyond the control of taxpayers. Examples of extenuating circumstances to
                                 consider include; illness, loss of employment, a personal loss (family or loved one), identity theft/return preparer misconduct/embezzlement
                                 or natural acts of nature, etc.  
                              



The following are some examples of flagrant conduct. 

Example:
(A) Taxpayers whose failure to pay is based on frivolous arguments which are listed in Notice 2010–33, IRB 2010–1 C.B. 609,
                                 or subsequent updates. See IRB 2010–33 at  http://www.irs.gov/irb/2010-17_IRB/ar13.html.
                              


Example:
(B) Taxpayers who voluntarily contributed to retirement accounts during the time period the taxpayer knew unpaid taxes were
                                 accruing. See IRM 5.15.1.27, Retirement or Profit Sharing Plans.
                              


Caution:
When the taxpayer verifies they have been automatically enrolled to have a limited percentage of their basic pay deducted
                                 and deposited into a retirement account do not consider this flagrant conduct.
                              


Example:
(C) Taxpayers who continue to make voluntary contributions to retirement accounts while asserting an inability to pay an amount
                                 that is owed while IRS determined voluntary contributions not necessary living expenses and disallowed them for the purpose
                                 of determining taxpayers’ ability to pay. See IRM 5.15.1.27,  Retirement or Profit Sharing Plans.
                              


Caution:
Where a tax liability has been discharged in bankruptcy, the IRS may continue to have a valid tax lien on certain retirement
                                 assets that existed prior to the bankruptcy. See IRM 5.11.6.2(15). Voluntary contributions made to such retirement assets after the bankruptcy petition was filed are not considered flagrant.
                              


Caution:
 When the taxpayer verifies they have been automatically enrolled to have a limited percentage of their basic pay deducted
                                 and deposited into a retirement account do not consider this flagrant conduct.
                              


Example:
(D) Taxpayers convicted of tax evasion for the tax debt.


Example:
(E) Taxpayers assessed with a fraud penalty for the tax debt.


Example:
 (F) Taxpayers assisting others in evading tax.


Example:
 (G) Taxpayers with liabilities based on illegal income.


Example:
 (H) Taxpayers who are in business, pyramiding unpaid trust fund taxes, and fail to provide a complete CIS, does not comply
                                 with the results of the Service's financial analysis or fail to timely make FTDs.
                              


Example:
(I)  Individual taxpayers who are accumulating unpaid income taxes over multiple tax periods and will not adjust their withholding
                                 or make timely and adequate estimated tax payments to prevent future delinquencies. See IRM 5.1.10.3.2(5)(e).
                              


Example:
(J) Trust Fund Recovery Penalty modules has been assessed at different times or against more than one business entity.


Example:
(K) Taxpayers who have demonstrated a pattern of uncooperative or unresponsive behavior that delays the collection of the
                                 tax due, e.g., failing to meet established deadlines, failing to attend scheduled appointments, documented broken promises
                                 to pay, failing to respond to IRS employee’s attempts to contact. In such cases, determining alternatives and the taxpayer's
                                 dependence on the money in the retirement accounts (final step) may not be possible, so a levy may need to be served without
                                 making those determinations. 
                              


Example:
(L) Taxpayers who have placed other assets beyond the reach of the government, e.g., sending them outside the country, concealing
                                 them, dissipating them, or transferring them to other people.
                              


Example:
(M) Taxpayers with jeopardy or termination assessments subject to collection.



The final step in deciding whether to levy on retirement assets is to determine whether the taxpayer depends on the money
                              in the retirement account (or will in the near future) for necessary living expenses. If the taxpayer is dependent on the
                              funds in the retirement account (or will be in the near future), do not levy the retirement account. In determining whether
                              the taxpayer depends on the money (or will in the near future), use the standards in IRM 5.15, Financial Analysis, to establish necessary living expenses. Use the life expectancy tables in Pub 590-B, Distribution from Individual Retirement
                              Arrangements (IRAs), to estimate how much can be withdrawn annually to deplete the retirement account in the taxpayer's remaining
                              life. Also, consider any special circumstances in the taxpayer's specific situation, such as extraordinary expenses or additional
                              sources of income that will be available to pay expenses during retirement.
                           


 The taxpayer may be able to withdraw money in a lump sum from a retirement plan. If the taxpayer is eligible to receive such
                              a withdrawal, then a levy can reach that right. However, remember that a levy only reaches the taxpayer's present rights under
                              the plan.  This means that a current levy can reach a taxpayer’s vested present rights under a plan, but a levy does not accelerate
                              payment and it is only enforceable when the taxpayer is eligible to receive the benefits.  The terms of the plan may need
                              to be reviewed to determine a taxpayer’s present rights. 
                           

Example:
The taxpayer is fully vested in his retirement plan account balance of $10,000.  Pursuant to the terms of the plan, the taxpayer
                                 is not yet in payout status or entitled to a lump sum withdrawal until a future date.  A levy may attach to the taxpayer’s
                                 present right to the $10,000, but no money can be collected until the taxpayer has a right to withdraw those funds at the
                                 future date.  At such future date, the taxpayer’s account may have grown to $30,000.  Without a new levy, however, only $10,000
                                 can be collected because this was the taxpayer’s present right at the time of levy.  
                              


Example:
 The taxpayer has an accrued benefit in a retirement plan but the terms of the plan do not allow for any lump sum withdrawal.
                                 The plan provides a right in the future to receive monthly payments, but the taxpayer has not yet participated in the plan
                                 long enough to qualify for any future payments (that is, the taxpayer is currently 0% vested in the accrued benefit derived
                                 from employer contributions). The taxpayer has no present property rights in the employer derived accrued benefit to which
                                 a notice of levy can attach.  A notice of levy may attach to any contributions made by the taxpayer, as the taxpayer is always
                                 100% vested in those contributions, but collection will depend on whether the taxpayer has a right under the terms of the
                                 plan to withdraw those funds.
                              



The notice of levy form says it does not attach money in pension or retirement plans. When levying on these funds, sign the
                              notice of levy in the block to the left of, "Total Amount Due. "
                              			
                           


Have the SB/SE Director, Collection Area approve the notice of levy by signing the form as the Service Representative or see
                              IRM 5.11.1.3.5, Managerial Approval, for methods to secure managerial approval.
                           


Consider discussing the case with the Employee Plans Group before issuing the levy. Their advice, as well as advice from AI
                              - Advisory and Associate Area Counsel, may be needed to determine the present right to property. Often, a levy is served before
                              the taxpayer's precise rights are determined. Try to get a copy of the plan instruments as soon as possible to determine the
                              taxpayer's interests in the plan.
                           


When available, review a copy of the plan prior to issuing the levy to identify the correct custodian. Unless any documents
                              or other pieces of evidence reflect that pension or retirement account has more than one custodian, no additional parties
                              beyond the pension or retirement custodian need be served with the levy.
                           


When money is withdrawn from a retirement account, the taxpayer may be liable for income tax on the withdrawal. If the taxpayer
                              is less than 591/1 years old, a 10 percent additional tax on early distributions may be assessed. However, the taxpayer is not liable for the
                              10 percent additional tax on early distributions if the money was withdrawn because of a notice of levy served on the retirement
                              account. See IRC 72(t)(2)(A) vii. There may, however, still be income tax owed for the amount withdrawn.
                           


Send Letter 3257 (DO) with the notice of levy and Letter 3258 (DO) with the taxpayer's copy of the notice of levy. These letters
                              state the withdrawal is not subject to the 10 percent additional tax on early distributions, even if the taxpayer is under
                              591/1 years old. These letters are available as templates on the Integrated Collection System.
                           


Retirement accounts that are exempted from the bankruptcy estate are still subject to being levied to collect taxes that are discharged in bankruptcy, where a
                              Notice of Federal Tax Lien was filed before bankruptcy. For retirement accounts that are excluded from the bankruptcy estate, the Service may still levy on those accounts to collect taxes that are discharged in bankruptcy
                              even when no Notice of Federal Tax Lien has been filed. It is only necessary that the discharged taxes were assessed, that
                              notice and demand was given, and that the statutory lien arose before the bankruptcy was filed. Consider a levy on the retirement
                              accounts if there is no other property that survived the bankruptcy. See IRM 5.9.17.4, Exempt, Abandoned or Excluded Property (EAEP), and IRM 5.9.17.4.2(4) Collection from Exempt, Abandoned or Excluded Property (EAEP) for guidance in determining whether collection action should be taken.
                           

Note:
In this situation, the Federal Tax Lien attaches to only the taxpayer/debtor's property or rights to property held as of the
                                 bankruptcy petition date. However, the lien is not limited to the value of the property as of the petition date. Its attachment
                                 relates to any appreciation or diminution of such assets. The federal tax lien does not attach to retirement account contributions
                                 made on or after the bankruptcy petition date. Care must be taken to limit collection to only the bankruptcy pre-petition
                                 account value. Consult with AI-Insolvency or Counsel prior to issuing levies on exempted or excluded retirement accounts for
                                 assistance in determining the account value the levy attaches.
                              


Note:
Retirement accounts that are exempt from the bankruptcy estate are not subject to being levied to collect taxes that are discharged in bankruptcy where no Notice of Federal Tax Lien was filed prior to bankruptcy. See IRM 5.9.17.4(1), for details regarding exempt assets.
                              








5.11.6.2.1 
                                   (07-17-2015)Thrift Savings Plan
                              







Federal employees may contribute to Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) accounts.  Unlike levies on employer and self-sponsored retirement
                                 accounts, which only reach the taxpayer's present rights under the plan, the IRS can seize the balance in vested TSP accounts
                                 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8437(e)(3), a special statutory provision, which authorizes turnover of funds in TSP accounts to the
                                 IRS pursuant to IRS levies.  The levy will attach to any TSP account that is vested, or will become vested within 30 days
                                 of the date the TSP receives the levy if the participant were to remain in Government service.  The Federal Retirement Thrift
                                 Investment Board (FRTIB) has issued regulations governing TSP levies at 79 FR 53603 (Sept. 10, 2014).
                              


A taxpayer might request the Service to levy his/her TSP account since the taxpayer might not be otherwise able to access
                                 the funds, or, if the taxpayer is no longer employed by the Government, the taxpayer might be seeking to avoid paying a 10
                                 percent additional tax on early retirement plan withdrawals.  Do not levy on a TSP account at the request of the taxpayer.
                                  Instead, follow the guidelines set forth below.
                              


The determination to levy on a TSP account should be treated in the same way as a levy on a private pension or retirement
                                 plan or IRA.  Follow the procedures set forth in IRM 5.11.6.2 (4) through (7) to determine whether to levy on the taxpayer's TSP account.
                              


The notice of levy, Form 668-A(ICS) or Form 668-A(c)(DO), states that it does not attach to funds in pension or retirement
                                 plans, unless it is signed in the specified block.  When levying on TSP accounts, sign the notice of levy in the block to
                                 the left of "Total Amount Due."
                                 			
                              


Have the SB/SE Area Director, Field Collection approve the notice of levy by signing the form as the Service Representative
                                 or see IRM 5.11.1.3.5, Managerial Approval, for methods to secure managerial approval.
                              


The levy must be issued in the name of the participant only.


The levy must expressly refer to the "Thrift Savings Plan."
                                 			
                              


The levy must require the payment of a stated dollar amount from the TSP participant’s account, up to the entire amount of
                                 the vested account balance.  The levy may not request a payment at a specified date in the future nor may it request a series
                                 of payments.  The levy cannot designate a specific TSP fund, source of contributions, or balance from which the payment or
                                 portions of the payment shall be made.
                              


Before issuing a levy on a non-liable spouse in a community property state, consult with Advisory or Counsel to determine
                                 if the state community property laws allow the levy.  If the levy is allowed, request the assistance of Counsel to draft the
                                 levy to ensure the levy will not be dishonored by the TSP because it was not issued in the name of the participant only.
                              


All levies on TSP accounts should be on Form 668-A(ICS) or Form 668-A(c)(DO) and should be mailed to the following address:
                                 Thrift Savings Plan, Attn: TSP Legal Processing Unit, P.O. Box 4570, Fairfax, VA 22038-9998.  If immediate delivery of the
                                 levy is necessary, the fax number, and the address for overnight delivery of IRS levies can be found at http://www.tsp.gov under Contact TSP page.  The levy must be received by the TSP offices designated above no later than 30 days after the date
                                 on the levy form.
                              


After receipt of the levy, the TSP will mail a decision letter to all parties containing the following information:



A determination regarding whether the levy is qualifying;






If the qualifying levy requires payment, the letter will provide the estimated payment amount and anticipated payment date.





Payment pursuant to a qualifying levy will be made 30 days after the TSP decision letter.  The payment is taxable to the participant
                                 and subject to federal income tax withholding.
                              

Note:
Once the levy is paid, the funds cannot be returned to the TSP account.










5.11.6.3 
                                (05-05-1998)Insurance
                           







This subsection contains instructions on levying on insurance.







5.11.6.3.1 
                                   (01-22-2010)Cash Loan Value of Life Insurance
                              







The cash loan value of life insurance and endowment contracts can be levied. The policy does not have to be surrendered. See
                                 IRC 6332(b).
                              







5.11.6.3.1.1 
                                      (09-26-2014)Serving the Levy
                                 







Generally, do not levy the cash loan value of life insurance if the taxpayer has: 



few assets,


small income, and


policies with a face value below $1000.





If known, write the following on the notice of levy: 



policy number(s) followed by "and all other policies this person owns or has an interest in,"
                                             			
                                          


date of birth, or


taxpayer's approximate age and spouse's name.





The Revenue Officer group manager, Insolvency group manager or a Technical Service Advisory group manager must approve the
                                    notice of levy per Delegation Order 5-3 contained in IRM 1.2.44.4, Delegation Order 5-3 (Rev. 1). See IRM 5.11.1.3.5, Managerial Approval.
                                 


The insurance company does not have to turn over money until 90 days pass. 



Compute penalty and interest through 90 days from the date of the levy.


Write, "I certify that a copy of this notice was mailed on (insert date) to the taxpayer's last known address"
                                             			 above the taxpayer's name and address.
                                          


Sign this statement.


Mail Part 4 to the taxpayer before sending the levy to the insurance company.
                                          











5.11.6.3.1.2 
                                      (01-22-2010)Payment for a Levy on the Cash Loan Value of Life Insurance
                                 







If the amount owed is paid before 90 days, send the insurance company Letter 980(DO), Notice of Levy Against Insurance Cash Value,  with a release of levy.
                                 


The taxpayer can ask the insurance company to pay before 90 days to save penalty and interest. A new payoff figure may be
                                    needed.
                                 


If the amount is not paid within 90 days, attempt contact with the insurance company and send Letter 980(DO) to the insurance
                                    company. This tells them the amount still owed. Send the letter even if the amount has not changed.
                                 


The insurance company must pay over the amount the taxpayer could have obtained as a loan. This amount is computed to the
                                    90th day after the levy. Automatic premium loans and contractual interest is not paid over, if they keep the contract in force.
                                    However, an agreement to do this must be before the insurance company knew of the tax lien.
                                 








5.11.6.3.1.3 
                                      (09-26-2014)Actual Knowledge of the Tax Lien
                                 







The insurance company may have to pay more than the amount in IRM 5.11.6.3.1. That amount is increased by the amount of any advances (including contractual interest thereon) made on or after the date
                                    the insurer had actual knowledge of the tax lien for which the levy is made, other than any advance (including contractual
                                    interest thereon) made automatically to keep the insurance contract in effect under an agreement entered into before the insurer
                                    had actual knowledge.  See IRC 6331(c)(2). 
                                 


Give the insurance company a copy of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien or a letter to give actual notice of the lien. This stops
                                    the taxpayer from taking loans as equity builds up in the policy. 
                                 

Note:
 Do not try to give notice by serving a new levy. This starts the 90 day period again.










5.11.6.3.2 
                                   (01-22-2010)Foreclosure on the Policy
                              







There is also a right to foreclose on the policy, if necessary. Consult with Collection Advisory and Associate Area Counsel
                                 for advice. See IRM 5.17.3.9.12, Legal Reference Guide for Revenue Officers - Insurance, for discussion of the differences between foreclosing on the policy to obtain the cash surrender value and levying to obtain
                                 the cash loan value. 
                              








5.11.6.3.3 
                                   (05-05-1998)Department of Veterans Affairs Insurance Policies
                              







Dividends payable in cash and the cash loan value of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insurance policies can be levied.
                                 
                              

Exception:
If the dividends are applied to pay future premiums, they can not be levied.

                                      (01-22-2010)Levy on Cash Loan Value of VA Insurance Policies
                                 







Many VA insurance policies have cash loan value. This can be levied like other life insurance policies. Some policies are
                                    term life insurance. These have no cash loan value.
                                 


Write, "Levy is only against cash loan value,"
                                    			 on the levy. Also, include the policy number. Use other procedures in IRM 5.11.6.3.1, above. For example, send Letter 980 (DO), Notice of Levy Against Insurance Cash Value, after 90 days.

To levy an insurance company employee's income, send Form 668-W(ICS) or 668-W(c)(DO). Write on the form that it is levying
                                 the person's income. This may prevent confusion between these and levies on policies.
                              


Contact the insurance company to determine where to send the levy.

                                   (01-22-2010)Death Benefits
                              







Death benefits from an insurance company or a government agency (Veterans Administration, Social Security Administration,
                                 etc.) can be levied. However, only use this source in flagrant cases. See IRM 5.11.6.2(6). Consider whether the levy will cause a hardship and whether it may prevent the taxpayer from paying the funeral expenses
                                 of the person who died.
                              


Because of the sensitive nature, have the SB/SE Director, Collection Area approve the notice of levy. See IRM 5.11.1.3.5,
                                 Managerial Approval, for methods to secure managerial approval.

The income of federal, state and local government officers and employees can be levied. This includes: 



Civilian Employees


Military Personnel


Elected Officials


Appointed Officials





If the taxpayer increases voluntary deductions after a levy is served, tell the employer that this is not allowed. 

Note:
Comptroller General's Decision B–45105 explains this to federal payroll offices. This decision is dated January 21, 1955,
                                 and amended April 18, 1955.
                              



Certain government employee salaries are included in the Federal Payment Levy Program. See IRM 5.11.7.2.1.1, IRS/FMS Interagency Agreement - Federal Payments Subject to the FPLP, and IRM Exhibit 5.11.7-1, FPLP - Federal Employee Salary Paying Agencies: NFC, NBC, GSA, DFAS.

If a taxpayer is in a Combat Zone (CZ) or has been granted military deferment under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act of
                                 2003, no levy action is to be taken. This includes issuance of L1058, Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to
                                 a Hearing. See IRM 5.1.7.9, Accounts of Taxpayers Who Serve in a Combat Zone, and IRM 5.1.7.12, Military Deferment, for additional clarification.
                              


Combat Zone (CZ) accounts, identified by a -C freeze, indicate a taxpayer who is or was serving in a designated combat zone
                                 area.  
                              

Note:
The -C freeze stays on the account even after the taxpayer is no longer in the CZ.  When working an account that contains
                                    a –C freeze, additional research is required to determine the taxpayer's CZ status.  Research CC IMFOLE for the Combat indicator
                                    on Line 11.

Use Form 668-A(ICS) or 668-A(c)(DO) to levy payments owed to federal contractors. Except as described in (4) below, the levy
                              has no continuing effect. It only reaches payments owed to the contractor when the levy is received. 
                           

Note:
Prior to levying the Federal agency with Form 668–A(ICS) or 668–A(c)(DO) on either the primary or secondary taxpayer, release
                                 or block the module from the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP), if necessary. See IRM 5.11.7.2.6, Blocking or Releasing FPLP Levy. 



The contract number must be included on levies sent to the Department of Defense. If the number is known, include it on levies
                              sent to other federal agencies, too. This can help them find the contract and honor the levy. 
                           

Note:
Current federal contract levy sources can be found on IDRS using cc LEVYS. The contract number may appear on the levy source's
                                 name line after, "CONTRACT #."

See Exhibit 5.11.6-1 for contract levy addresses at several agencies.
                           


Federal contractor and vendor payments are systemically levied through the FPLP. IRC 6331(h) permits the Service to serve
                              a continuous levy on up to 15 percent of certain federal payments. If the payments are for vendor of property, goods or services
                              sold or leased to the Federal government, the Service may levy up to 100 percent of the payments under section 6331(h), as
                              amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2011. See generally IRM 5.11.7.2, Federal Payment Levy Program, and specifically IRM 5.11.7.2.1.1, IRS/BFS Interagency Agreement – Federal Payments Subject to the FPLP, regarding implementation of the FPLP increase for certain payments.
                           


Since January 2006, the FPLP matches and levies Federal payments identified under the secondary or cross-reference (X-REF)
                              SSN on IMF joint tax liabilities and BMF sole proprietor liabilities.

Levy Medicare payments paid to beneficiaries only in flagrant cases. Generally, see examples at IRM 5.11.6.2(6). A beneficiary is "A person who has health care insurance through the Medicare programs."
                                 			 Medicare payments to beneficiaries are not considered to be income so use Form 668-A(ICS) or 668A(c)(DO).
                              


An insurance company or Medicare Administrative Contractors referred to as MACs contracting with the Centers for Medicare
                                 and Medicaid Services (CMS) makes the Medicare payments. To locate the current MAC access the web page , https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-Contractors/MedicareAdministrativeContractors.html
                                    . and search Who are the MACS based upon the State.  Then follow the links to locate the geographic region and MAC serving each State. See Exhibit 5.11.6-3,
                                 Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) for list of addresses.
                              


The insurance company or contract carrier directly pays hospitals, home health agencies, and extended care facilities. Doctors
                                 and other medical services and supplies can be paid directly, too. However, the beneficiary may have paid the expense to be
                                 reimbursed by Medicare later.
                              


The territory manager must approve the notice of levy on Medicare payments paid to beneficiaries. See IRM 5.11.1.3.5, Managerial Approval, for methods to secure managerial approval.

Starting October 2008, the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) expanded to include Medicare and Supplier Payments made to
                                 providers by an insurance company or carrier contracting with the CMS. See IRM 5.11.7.
                              


Whenever the FPLP indicator is present on a module, revenue officers may decide to levy the Medicare provider payments through
                                 the FPLP -- attaching the entire 100% of the disbursement continuously which is the most efficient method; or the levy may
                                 be converted to utilize the general levy and distraint statute, IRC 6331(a). 
                              

Note:
Levy on Medicare payments paid to providers does not require second level approval. Prior to issuing the Form 668-A(ICS) or
                                    668-A(c)(DO), release or block the module from the FPLP, if necessary. See IRM 5.11.7.2.6, Blocking or Releasing FPLP Levy. Serve the levy on the insurance company or Medicare Administrative Contractors referred to as MACs. To locate the current
                                    MAC access the web pagehttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-Contractors/MedicareAdministrativeContractors.html
                                        and search Who are the MACS based upon the State.  Then follow the links to locate the geographic region and the MAC serving each State. See Exhibit

5.11.6.6.3 
                                   (09-26-2014)Medicaid Payments Paid to Providers
                              







The Medicaid Act, under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, is a federal-state cost-sharing program that provides medical
                                 assistance to families and individuals with insufficient income and resources. Within the bounds of federal statutory and
                                 regulatory requirements, the state enters into agreements with providers of services and establishes a level of reimbursement
                                 to be paid to providers. Upon approval of its plan, a state becomes entitled to reimbursement by the federal government for
                                 a portion of its payment to hospitals and other providers of medical assistance to Medicaid recipients. This federal contribution
                                 to a state’s Medicaid expenses is termed "federal financial participation."
                                 			
                              

Note:
Those receiving Medicaid assistance are called beneficiaries.



Each state operates and administers its approved Medicaid plan in accordance with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’s
                                 (CMS) state Medicaid plan. Each state:
                              



Establishes its own eligibility standards.


Determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services.


Sets the rate of payment for services.


Administers enrollment of providers. 





Providers must first enroll in the Medicaid program to receive payment for services or goods provided to beneficiaries. Federal
                                 law does not prohibit providers with unpaid federal taxes from enrolling in or receiving payments from Medicaid. 
                              


States have traditionally provided Medicaid benefits using a fee-for-service system. The providers submit their claims to
                                 the state for payment and the state is responsible for claim processing and payment. Under fee-for-service arrangements, states
                                 pay providers directly for services.
                              


 Recently, many states have implemented a managed care delivery system for Medicaid benefits. In a managed care delivery system,
                                 beneficiaries get most or all of their Medicaid services from an organization under contract with the state. When considering
                                 a Medicaid provider levy, determine if the provider is paid directly by the state (fee-for service) or through a managed care
                                 program. The levy should be served on either the state or the appropriate managed care program, not both.
                              





When states implement a managed care program, they can use any one of the following types of entities:




Type
Defined


Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)
Similar to Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), these companies agree to provide most Medicaid benefits to people in exchange
                                             for a monthly payment from the state.
                                          


Limited Benefit Plans
These companies may look like HMOs, but only provide one or two Medicaid benefits (e,g., mental health or dental services).


Primary Care Case Managers
These individual providers (or groups of providers) agree to act as an individual’s primary care provider, and receive a small
                                             monthly payment for helping to coordinate referrals and other medical services.
                                          






A Levy on Medicaid payments paid to providers is subject to IRM 1.2.44.4(5),Delegation Order 5-3 (Rev. 1).  Use Form 668-A(ICS) or 668-A(c)(DO) to levy payments owed to Medicaid providers. Medicaid disbursements by the federal government
                                 to the states do not qualify as "federal payments"
                                 			 for purpose of continuous levy. Medicaid  payments paid to providers/suppliers are not subject to continuous levy under
                                 IRC§ 6331(h) or the FPLP. These payments are administered and paid out by state government agencies for CMS.

                                   (09-26-2014)U.S. Savings Bonds—Series HH/H Interest Payments
                              







Series HH/H savings bonds pay interest semi-annually. Series HH U.S. Savings Bonds are no longer available for purchase. Because
                                 they are a 20-year non-marketable bond, some people still own HH bonds.
                              


To levy the interest, use Form 668-W(ICS) or 668-W(c)(DO). See SERP, Who/Where, Levy Source Information for the address to
                                 mail these levies. With the levy, send a copy of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Also, send a letter with the levy. Include
                                 in the letter: 
                              



bond series,


serial number(s),


bond denomination(s), and


bond issue date(s).

                                   (09-26-2014)Farm Service Agency Program Payments
                              







In 1994, the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) was merged with other Agriculture agencies to create
                                 the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Serve levies on Farm Service Agency county offices to attach these program payments.
                              





If
And
Then




The taxpayer is eligible for payment
FSA is authorized to pay the taxpayer
A levy payment will be sent.


The taxpayer is eligible for payment
FSA is not authorized to pay the taxpayer yet
FSA will complete the back of the levy and state when the payment will be made and how much it will be for. When a payment
                                             is authorized, FSA will send the amount the taxpayer was eligible for on the date of the levy. No new levy is needed.
                                          


The taxpayer is not eligible for payment
 
FSA will send the levy back saying no money is owed. If they know when the taxpayer will be eligible, they will say so. Another
                                             levy can be served later, if appropriate.
                                          






The listing of County offices for FSA can be found at the following web page  http://offices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app?state=us&agency=fsa.


To determine the correct counties eligible for FSA payments contact the FSA state office for assistance. The listing of state
                                 offices for FSA can be found at the following web page http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/stateOffices.

                                   (01-22-2010)Relocation Act Payments
                              







Relocation Act payments pay for displaced people's: 



moving costs,


related expenses, and


cost of replacement housing.





Levy these payments only in flagrant cases. See IRM 5.11.6.2(6). The SB/SE Collection territory manager or an Collection Advisory manager (second level or above) must approve the notice
                                 of levy. See IRM 5.11.1.3.5, Managerial Approval.

                                   (05-05-1998)Fees for Attorneys of Social Security Claimants
                              







Records of attorneys for Social Security claimants are with the claimant's files. To levy an attorney's fees, attach a list
                                 of claimants' names and SSNs. If the SSNs are not known, give anything else to identify the claimant. 
                              

Example:
Include the claimants' address and date of birth, if these are known.



Avoid sending these levies without claimants' SSNs. SSA's files, like those of IRS, are very large. There are many people
                                 with the same name.
                              


A separate levy is not needed for each claimant's fees.








5.11.6.6.8 
                                   (06-29-2001)State Income Tax Refunds
                              







The IRS has established the State Income Tax Levy Program (SITLP) in many states. This program matches computer tapes of IRS
                                 liabilities and state refund tapes. The state tax agency sends payment with a list (or tape) of taxpayers whose refunds were
                                 taken.
                              


Payments posted before 2000 used designated payment code (DPC) 04. Starting in 2000, these payments use DPC 20 for systemically
                                 applied payments and DPC 21 for manually applied payments. If the taxpayer says a state refund paid the amount owed, check
                                 IDRS for the payment. If it has not posted, ask for a copy of the state's letter showing the refund was taken. If the refund
                                 only pays part of the amount owed, collect the rest. 
                              


Taxpayer inquiries regarding errors with SITLP levies may require coordination with SITLP coordinator to resolve. See IRM
                                 5.19.9.2.3SITLP Coordinator.

                                   (01-22-2010)National Labor Relations Board and Backpay Awards
                              







Backpay awards administered by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can be attached by issuing Form 668-A(ICS) or 668-A(c)(DO),
                                 Notice of Levy, to the appropriate Regional Office of the Board. See Exhibit 5.11.6-2 for addresses, contacts, and phone numbers for the NLRB Regional Offices. Send the levy to the office closest to the location
                                 of the taxpayer. If it is unclear which office to send the notice of levy to, then call the closest office or access www.nlrb.gov
                                 and click on "Find Your Regional Office"
                                 			.
                              


Include the case name and number on the form.





If
And
Then




There has been a final nonappealable determination that the taxpayer is eligible for payment
The amount of the award has been determined
The NLRB Regional Office will forward the levy payment.


There has been a final nonappealable determination that the taxpayer is eligible for payment
The amount of the award has not yet been determined
The NLRB Regional Office will notify the contact person on the notice of levy that the amount of the backpay award and the
                                             date of distribution are unknown. NLRB will provide an estimated date, if available, when they will comply with the levy.
                                          


A levy has been served
The IRS no longer wants the NLRB to honor the levy
The IRS will issue a levy release to the NLRB Regional Office


There has been no final determination that the taxpayer is eligible for payment (case is under investigation or on appeal)
 
The NLRB Regional Office will complete the back of the levy form indicating no money is owed the taxpayer. If the taxpayer
                                             later becomes eligible for payment, the Regional Office will so advise the revenue officer who issued the notice of levy so
                                             that a new levy can be issued, if appropriate.
                                          






If the amount of the check for the backpay award exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's outstanding tax liability, apply the
                                 full amount of the check to the taxpayer's account and any overpayment will be refunded to the taxpayer subject to IRS overpayment/refund
                                 procedures. The refund will be systemically issued, no action is required of the RO. 
                              


If the taxpayer's employer has not withheld the taxes from the backpay award, the NLRB will withhold the taxes before issuing
                                 the levy payment.
                              









5.11.6.7 
                                (03-15-2005)Receivables
                           







Accounts receivable, notes receivable, and other debts owed to a taxpayer may be levied upon.


Accounts receivable are assets representing money due to a taxpayer for products and services provided on credit. 

Example:
 monies owed to the taxpayer by clients, customers, patients, insurance companies, rental income, funds processed by credit
                                 card companies
                              



Consider issuing a summons to the taxpayer's bank for deposited items to obtain information on possible accounts receivable
                              on which to levy.
                           


A note receivable is a certain amount loaned to another that is owed and payable at a certain time to the holder of the promissory
                              note. 
                           

Example:
money loaned to a customer, employee, or officer of the company.



A notice of levy reaches future payments, only if the taxpayer already has a right to them.


If receivables can be sold, consider seizing and selling them.







5.11.6.7.1 
                                   (01-22-2010)Billing Services
                              







Some taxpayers use billing services for receivables. The service may only prepare bills, or it may also receive payments.
                                 
                              





If
Then




The billing service only prepares and sends the bills
Use a summons or Form 2270, Notice to Exhibit Books and Records, to review records of the taxpayer's receivables to obtain
                                             levy sources.
                                          


The billing service receives payments and forwards them to the taxpayer 
Serve a levy on the billing service.





Caution:
Form 2270 must not be used to solicit information from a financial institution within the Tenth Circuit or in any circumstance
                                    where a suit can be filed against the U.S. Government within the 10th Circuit. See IRM 25.5, Summons Handbook, for information on those circumstances.
                                 



Tapes may include records of many of the billing service's customers. Use a summons or Form 2270 to get only the taxpayer's
                                 records. The ten calendar day response period for summonses may need to be extended to get the records extracted.
                              


The billing service may deduct a fee and send the difference to the taxpayer. In this case, this is all the billing service
                                 needs to pay in response to the levy. If it normally sends the entire receivable to the taxpayer, then this should be paid
                                 in response to the levy.
                              









5.11.6.8 
                                (02-25-2016)Securities—Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, etc.
                           







The taxpayer's ownership interest in securities is subject to collection. Stocks, bonds, money market accounts, mutual funds,
                              and debentures are examples of securities.
                           


The levied party’s compliance with the notice of levy depends on the redemption rights of the taxpayer and the liquidity of
                              the interest. 
                           



Mutual funds are redeemed, and subject to the levy procedures.  The broker or other levy source must turn over the redemption
                                       proceeds to the Service in response to a notice of levy. The levy proceeds may be reduced by the broker commission or transaction
                                       fee the broker is entitled to under the agreement with the taxpayer.
                                    


Certificated and uncertificated publicly-traded stock are subject to the levy procedures. The stock account held by a broker
                                       or other third-party agent should be liquidated in response to a notice of levy. The levy proceeds may be reduced by the broker
                                       commission or transaction fee the broker is entitled to under the agreement with the taxpayer. .
                                    


Bonds are redeemable for cash at maturity. Prior to maturity, they are subject to seizure and sale. The collection mechanism
                                       used will depend on how close the proposed collection action is to the maturity date.
                                    


Dividends payable and interest due at the time of the levy are subject to levy.




Note:
In the rare case where the Service has obtained possession of physical stock certificates as result of a levy or seizure,
                                 the Service is still entitled to demand redemption or liquidation of the account from the third-party agent or other appropriate
                                 party.
                              


Note:
Do not demand the liquidation of stock that is not publicly-traded (for example shares in a closely-held corporation). In
                                 such a situation, seize and administratively sell the shares, or refer the case to Counsel for a lien foreclosure suit.
                              



The following chart addresses the most common securities.





If
Then


The Service levies on taxpayer’s interest in mutual fund evidenced by electronic or paper statements, 
issue Form 668-A(C)(DO) to third party agent holding the account or the fund demanding turnover of proceeds minus previously
                                          agreed to commission fee.
                                       


The Service levies on taxpayer’s account of publicly-traded stock evidenced by electronic or paper statements,
issue Form 668-A(C)(DO) to third party agent holding the account or the fund demanding turnover of proceeds minus previously
                                          agreed to commission fee.
                                       


 In response to a levy a revenue officer receives certificates, 
 the certificates should be turned in for redemption or liquidation minus previously agreed to commission fee.






Compliance Services Campus Operations (CSCO) sometimes receives securities for ACS levies. CSCO sends these to the territory
                              office for disposition.

Legal processes can be served at the UN: 



with the Secretary General's approval


in conditions the Secretary General approves.




Note:
This authority comes from a joint resolution of the 80th Congress.



Consider a levy on UN employees' salary only after all other sources have failed. Send the Form 668-W(ICS) or 668–W(c)(DO)
                              from the SB/SE Director, Collection Area to the Director of Collection Policy SE:S:C:HQC:P at Headquarters. Include a memo
                              that explains attempts to collect the tax and any other relevant information. See IRM 5.11.1.3.5, Managerial Approval. 
                           


Headquarters will forward the levy to the State Department and return to the revenue officer a copy for the case file.


Because of the restriction on legal process, the levy is used to counsel the employee.








5.11.6.10 
                                (01-22-2010)Additional International Organizations
                           







Some international organizations that have headquarters within the United States are entirely immune from service of levy
                              and, accordingly, are under no obligation to honor a levy. Do not issue notices of levy to collect taxes owed by the employees
                              of such organizations. At present, such organizations include: 
                           



The World Bank,


 Inter-American Development Bank.

                                (11-05-1999)Mutilated Currency
                           







Mutilated currency may be redeemed at the Department of Treasury. It can also be turned in to a bank which will send it to
                              Treasury for redemption. This can be levied.
                           


The fact that mutilated currency was turned in may be found out through routine investigation. Also, if the amount is $5000
                              or more, the Office of Currency Standards reports the request to IRS. Then, this may be reported to the area where the redemption

                                (01-22-2010)Levy on Non-Liable Spouse in a Community Property State
                           







In community property states, taxpayers who are liable for delinquent tax have a community property interest in their spouse's
                              property and rights to property. In this case, the delinquent taxpayers' property rights in their spouses' property and rights
                              to property might be subject to levy. 
                           

Example:
Taxpayers who are liable for delinquent tax may have a community property interest in their spouses' wages, so the wages of
                                 the spouse who is not liable for the tax might be subject to levy to pay it.
                              



Community property laws vary from state to state. This may affect how much of a non-liable spouse's property can be attached
                              by a levy. If you receive information or evidence, the delinquent taxpayer with a community property interest is divorced
                              or separated contact Collection Advisory regarding impact for that location. State law may have other effects, too. Contact
                              Collection Advisory for advice on any special language or inserts/cover letters needed with the levy, unless local instructions
                              have already been issued for how to handle these levies. Collection Advisory will consult with Associate Area Counsel, as
                              needed. 
                           

Note:
For further information about community property, see IRM 25.18.4,Collection of Taxes in Community Property States. 








5.11.6.12.1 
                                   (03-15-2005)Wages and Salary
                              







Although a non-liable spouse's wages or salary might be subject to levy, the levy does not have a continuous effect. This
                                 is because the Internal Revenue Code says that a levy on a taxpayer's wages and salary is continuous. However, in this case, the non-liablespouse's (not the taxpayer's) wages or salary is being levied.
                              


Although a levy on a non-liable spouse's wages or salary is not continuous, the exempt amount can still be claimed. 



However, because the levy might attach only part of the non-liable spouse's income, the portion that is not attached can be
                                          treated like an income source that is not being levied when the exempt amount is figured. See IRM 5.11.5.4.4, Taxpayers with More Than One Source of Income. 
                                       

Example:
 A non-liable spouse's weekly take home pay is $700. Assume this person is in a state where a levy attaches half of a non-liable
                                             spouse's wages, and this is the only source of income that is levied. This means $350 is not attached by the levy. If this
                                             levy is served in 2005, and the person is filing jointly with two exemptions, $325.38 is exempt from levy. Since the exempt
                                             amount is less than the amount that is not levied, no exempt amount is subtracted from the $350 that the levy attaches. The
                                             employer should send a weekly check of $350. The $325.38 exempt amount has been accounted for by the other $350 that is not
                                             attached.
                                          


Example:
 Take the same facts as the prior example, but the person claims four exemptions, so the weekly exempt amount is $438.46.
                                             Because this is more than the $350 that is not attached, the person needs to be allowed an additional exempt amount from the
                                             $350 that is attached. This is figured.     $438.46 Exempt from Levy     −$350.00 Not Attached by the Levy     $ 88.46 Additional Exempt Amount to be Allowed The employer, then, figures:     $350.00 Attached by the Levy     −$ 88.46 Additional Exempt Amount     $261.54 Weekly Levy Proceeds 



As a practical matter, in this example, a simpler explanation may be to tell the employer to send half of the person's take
                                          home pay if the exempt amount is less than half of that, but follow the instructions on the levy form if the exempt amount
                                          is more than half of the take home pay. This will lead to the same amount of levy proceeds:     $700.00 Take Home Pay    −$438.46 Exempt Amount     $261.54 Weekly Levy Proceeds
                                       











5.11.6.12.2 
                                   (09-26-2014)Notice to the Non-Liable Spouse
                              







When a taxpayer's community property interest in a non-liable spouse's property or right to property is levied, the notices
                                 in IRM 5.11.1.3.2, Required Notices, must have been sent to the taxpayer. However, do not send these notices to the non-liable spouse. 
                              


After serving the notice of levy, notify the non-liable spouse of the levy in the same manner required for taxpayer notice.
                                 See IRM 5.11.2.2.7, Notifying the Taxpayer After Serving the Levy.



If a notice of levy is served, e.g., on a bank account, a copy of the levy is sent to the taxpayer. Part 4 of Form 668-A(ICS)
                                          or 668A(c)(DO) is generally used for this. In this case, though, also send a photocopy of the taxpayer's copy of the levy
                                          to the non-liable spouse.
                                       


If a levy is served on wages, salary, or other income, the statement of exemptions and filing status notifies the taxpayer
                                          of the levy. Similarly, the non-liable spouse will get these copies of the levy to claim the exempt amount, and this is the
                                          notification that a levy has been served.
                                       





The non-liable spouse can appeal the notice of levy under the Collection Appeals Program. For referral to Taxpayer Advocate
                                 Service (TAS) see IRM 5.1.9.4.1(8).
                              









5.11.6.13 
                                (06-29-2001)Levy on Inheritances
                           







If a taxpayer is due an inheritance, serve the notice of levy on the administrator/executor.








5.11.6.14 
                                (01-22-2010)Limited Liability Companies
                           







For employment taxes on wages paid prior to January 01, 2009, a single member/owner LLC that did not elect to be classified
                              as an association taxable as a corporation is "disregarded" as an entity separate from its owner for Federal Tax purposes.
                              However, under regulations issued in August 2007, disregarded single member/owner LLCs will be treated as entities separate
                              from the single member/owner for employment tax purposes for wages paid on or after January 1, 2009. Therefore, if a single
                              member/owner LLC has not elected to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation, the LLC will be liable for employment
                              taxes on wages paid to the employees of the LLC on or after January 01, 2009 . 
                           

Note:
For the impact of regulations issued in August 2007 on certain excise taxes see IRM 5.1.21.13.6.1, Impact of Regulations Changes on Employment and Excise Taxation for a Disregarded Entity.



There is no systemic method of determining whether an assessment in the name and Employer Identification Number (EIN) of an
                              LLC for employment taxes on wages paid prior to January 1, 2009 is the responsibility of the LLC or a single member/owner
                              (SMO). Prior to taking levy action on these assessments, you must determine whether the LLC or the SMO is the liable taxpayer.
                              See IRM 5.1.21, Collecting from Limited Liability Companies.


A levy will attach only to the assets of the taxpayer identified. Identify levy source type on ICS using "P"
                              			 for primary when the LLC is the liable taxpayer and "S"
                              			 for the secondary when the SMO is the liable taxpayer.
                           


When the LLC is the liable taxpayer, a notice of levy must reflect the name, trade name, if applicable, and EIN of the LLC,
                              and not the name and identification number(s) of the SMO.
                           


When the SMO is the liable taxpayer, a notice of levy must reflect the name and identification number(s) of the SMO and not the name, trade name or identification number of the LLC.
                           


If the SMO is the liable taxpayer for assessments in the name and EIN of the LLC, special care is needed when preparing a
                              notice of levy: 
                           



Generate the notice of levy through ICS, selecting the appropriate Name/Address record and tax periods for the SMO.


Make an corrections using the edit features of Microsoft Word. 


To avoid accounts being incorrectly attached and to facilitate the posting of levy proceeds received, a disclaimer may be
                                       added to the notice of levy: "This notice attaches to all accounts in the name of (single member owner name and EIN) as owner
                                       of (name of disregarded LLC and EIN) but does not attach accounts established in the name of (name of disregarded LLC and
                                       EIN)"
                                       			
                                    





When the LLC is liable for some tax periods and the SMO is liable for other tax periods, issue a separate notice of levy for
                              each liable taxpayer, selecting the appropriate Name/Address record and tax periods for each levy. 
                           








5.11.6.15 
                                (01-01-2011)Levies on Merchant Accounts
                           







This section contains guidance on levies issued on merchant accounts.







5.11.6.15.1 
                                   (01-01-2011)Merchant Accounts
                              







A merchant account is a contract between a merchant and a bank or processor. The merchant account (contract) allows the bank
                                 or processor to process and/or receive card-based payments (credit or debit payment) for goods and/or services on the merchant’s
                                 behalf. This contract allows the merchant to accept card based payments.
                              


In this situation, the parties are as follows:



The merchant is the taxpayer.


A merchant service provider is the organization responsible for directly maintaining the relationship with the merchant (taxpayer.)
                                          The merchant service provider is normally an Independent Sales Organization or Merchant Service Provider (ISO/MSP). Few banks
                                          are currently ISO/MSPs. 
                                       

Example:
 A taxpayer owns a restaurant and wants to accept customer credit or debit card payments. The taxpayer enters into a contract
                                             with an ISO/MSP to process card-based payments. The ISO/MSP provides a merchant account for the taxpayer to account for the
                                             funds received at the end of the payment process.
                                          



An acquiring bank, also known as an acquirer, is the bank (or processor) that acquires the funds received on behalf of the
                                          merchant (taxpayer) at the end of the card-based payment process.
                                       


The issuing bank is the bank of the cardholder (customer) that purchases goods or service from the merchant (taxpayer).





Per the terms of the merchant account (contract), the acquiring bank (or processor) exchanges funds with issuing banks on
                                 behalf of the merchant (taxpayer), and pays the merchant for the net balance of their daily payment card activity: gross sales,
                                 minus reversals, interchange fees, and acquiring bank (or processor) fees. The acquiring bank (or processor) normally transfers
                                 a batch of payments to the merchant (taxpayer) daily.
                              

Note:
Some debit card transactions are settled directly to the merchant's (taxpayer's) operating bank account (normally checking
                                    account) nearly instantaneously and therefore are not transferred with the daily batch.
                                 



The ISO/MSP sells the merchant (taxpayer) the service of processing the credit card payments from the point of sale to the
                                 funds transfer to the acquiring bank. The point of sale (POS) is when the cardholder (customer) purchases a good or service
                                 from the merchant (taxpayer). The service sold to the merchant usually includes the equipment used at the POS, the service
                                 of a processor, and the merchant account (contract). 
                              

Note:
Although card payment processing methods vary by industry, typically, taxpayers get their card-based payment processing services
                                    from an ISO/MSP. Few banks actually sell processing or function as processors. A bank business customer who wants to take
                                    credit/debit cards is usually sent to the bank’s subsidiary corporation which processes credit card transactions or an ISO/MSP
                                    who works with the bank.
                                 



A "card network"
                                 			 or "interchange"
                                 			 is the network that acts as an intermediary between an acquiring bank and an issuing bank. VISA and MasterCard are card
                                 networks. The process of authorization, capture, and transfer of card-based payments goes through a card network or interchange.
                                 
                              


A processor provides the service of processing the card-based payments through the card network. The processor may be the
                                 ISO/MSP, acquiring bank, or a financial institution that specializes in card-payment processing. Regardless of the nature
                                 of the processor, the merchant account (contract) is between the merchant (taxpayer) and the acquiring bank or processor.
                              

Example:
 For VISA/MasterCard, the merchant (taxpayer) may establish a merchant account (contract) directly with an ISO/MSP or a processor
                                    to accomplish the card-payment processing. However, for the VISA/MasterCard network, the acquiring bank must be a bank or
                                    a processor owned by a bank.
                                 



The acquiring bank or processor provides the merchant (taxpayer) with a monthly merchant account statement. The Merchant Account
                                 Statement is similar to a bank statement and tells the merchant (taxpayer) about daily credit card transactions, fees paid
                                 and money amounts transferred to the merchant's (taxpayer’s) bank account.
                              








5.11.6.15.2 
                                   (12-02-2011)Determining the location of the Merchant Account
                              







To determine the location of the merchant account (contract), determine the acquiring bank or processor that holds the merchant
                                 account (contract). 
                              


During initial contact, determine if the taxpayer accepts card payments. If the taxpayer accepts card payments, then secure:
                                 
                              



The name and address of the merchant service provider 


Merchant account number (this is not a Routing Transaction Number (RTN)) 


The name and address of the acquiring bank (bank or processor) that holds the merchant account (contract) 


Copy of the merchant agreement


A copy of three months of merchant account statements





In the event of a non-responsive taxpayer, secure the information through the taxpayer’s bank holding the operating bank account
                                 (normally a checking account). The acquiring bank’s RTN and the merchant account number may appear on the taxpayer’s operating
                                 bank account statements.
                              


If unable to otherwise secure it, secure the merchant account number by a summons to the processor or acquiring bank, specifically
                                 requesting the merchant account number.
                              








5.11.6.15.3 
                                   (09-26-2014)Property the Merchant Account Levy Attaches
                              







IRC 6331(b) provides that a levy shall extend only to "property possessed or obligations existing at the time"
                                 			 of the levy. Under the terms of a merchant account, the acquiring bank or processor is obligated to pay the taxpayer for
                                 all credit card sales made. This obligation arises at the time of the sale, not when the funds are later forwarded to the
                                 acquiring bank. 
                              


Based upon the manner in which the processor or acquiring bank processes card-based payment sales, the acquiring bank or processor
                                 may have difficulty determining exactly which processing fees will be paid during the card-based payment process at the moment
                                 the levy is issued. The acquiring bank or processor cannot use this fact to refuse to honor the Service’s levy. Since the
                                 acquiring bank or processor does not make payments to the taxpayer instantaneously, the acquiring bank or processor clearly
                                 owes the taxpayer funds at least daily. 
                              


The funds held by the processors and acquiring bank are not deposits within the meaning of IRC 6332(c) and the 21 day holding
                                 period does not apply to these funds. Therefore, the credit card processor makes the payment when they otherwise make payments
                                 according to the merchant contract.
                              

Example:
The taxpayer's restaurant runs, batches, and transmits their credit card receipts daily with their processor. According to
                                    the merchant account (contract), the processor, agrees to deposit the funds into the restaurant's bank account three days
                                    after the credit card receipts are run. When complying with a Notice of Levy, the processor would remit the funds to the IRS
                                    three days after the receipt of the Notice of Levy according to the merchant account (contract). The levy funds remitted will
                                    not include the restaurant’s receipts after the day the levy was served.
                                 









5.11.6.15.4 
                                   (09-26-2014)Issuing a Merchant Account Levy
                              







Serve levies on the acquiring bank or processor holding the merchant account (contract).


The contract for some processors provides that processor will process the transaction and transmit to the issuing bank notification
                                 that the amount due should be sent to the acquiring bank. For this type of contract the processor will not have the funds
                                 owed to the taxpayer.  A levy must be served to the issuing bank for this type of contract.  
                              


Use Form 668A(ICS) or Form 668A(c)(DO), Notice of Levy, to levy funds held by a merchant account provider. In order to eliminate any confusion on the part of the processor and
                                 to minimize litigation on the part of the Service include the following paragraph on the levy.
                              


"This levy attaches to the proceeds of all sales completed by the taxpayer at the time the levy is issued, irrespective of
                                       when the processor pays the taxpayer. This levy may attach to funds being maintained in a charge back account or any other
                                       account which serves a similar function."
                                       			
                                    




Consider issuing a levy on regular intervals (i.e. daily, every other day or weekly) since credit card processor levies are
                                 not continuous. If the processor will not accept the levy via fax, forward using the mail. Do not send a batch of sequentially
                                 post-dated levies to levy daily – a new levy must be issued each day.
                              

Note:
Issuing a card payment levy by certified mail with a return receipt requested or via a fax machine with delivery confirmation
                                    requested will assist in determining the date and time the levy was received. Retain the certified mail receipt or the fax
                                    report of receipt in the administrative case file as proof of delivery of the levy.
                                 









5.11.6.15.5 
                                   (09-26-2014)Collecting from Charge Back Accounts
                              







Levies issued to a processing company attach to both the credit card sales made and funds held in the "charge back accounts."
                                 			 Some merchant agreements alternatively identify a charge back account as a "reserve account,"
                                 			 a "secondary account,"
                                 			 or a "security account."
                                 			 Although funds held in a charge back account belong to the merchant/taxpayer, under the typical contract, they are not
                                 available to the merchant/taxpayer until a specified amount of time after the contract is terminated.
                              


Depending on the merchant, the merchant agreement and the nature of the business, the size of a particular merchant charge
                                 back account may vary greatly. Review the merchant agreement to determine if the business is required to maintain a charge
                                 back account and the relative priority in these funds between the processing company and the Service.
                              


The processing company may have priority over the Service with respect to the funds in the charge back account if any of the
                                 following apply:
                              



The processing company has executed a setoff. This only applies if the processor has actually exercised the right of setoff
                                          and has evidence that it was done before the levy, otherwise funds in the charge back account still belong to the merchant
                                          and the Service's levy will attach.
                                       


The processing company has a security interest earlier in time than the filing date of the notice of federal tax lien under
                                          IRC 6323(a). The processor's priority interest in the contents of the reserve account is only valid to the extent that it
                                          has parted with "money or money's worth."
                                          			
                                       


The processor may hold a superpriority under IRC 6323(b)(10). The super priority may not apply to all processors as IRC 6323(b)(10)
                                          only applies to a bank or similar institutions. Additionally the processor bank must have parted with money or money's worth,
                                          as of the date that the processor bank is served with the levy and learns of the federal tax lien. See IRM 5.17.3.9.4(4),
                                          Bank Account.





If the Service levy has priority over the funds in the charge back account the processing company will not have to turn over
                                 those funds to the Service until the time period specified in the merchant agreement has expired. The Service does not have
                                 the right to unilaterally cancel the merchant agreement and force the funds in the charge back account to be paid over immediately.
                              









5.11.6.16 
                                (09-26-2014)Levy on Daycare
                           







Daycare is a service industry populated by individuals skilled in providing child care or elder care. They can be organized
                              in the standard business structure or as a non-profit organization and may be affiliated with churches or a community service
                              organization. The major source of income is a combination of private payments from parents, frequently involving a contractual
                              relationship with the daycare and government funding. The latter involves numerous state, county and local government programs.
                              
                           


Before serving a levy on the parents of children in daycare or participant in elder care (or their guardians), consider the
                              following:
                           



Determine if the levy on the parent/participant (or guardian) will have the most impact of available enforcement actions.
                                       Will the levy result in significant payment or positively impact the resolution of the case.
                                    


Discuss levy action with manager to identify advantages and disadvantages of the alternative method of collection. Document
                                       this discussion in the ICS history.
                                    


The decision to levy on parent/participant (or guardian) must be based on the individual facts and circumstances of each case.


Develop a plan for communicating the levy action to the parent/participant (or guardian) to alleviate confusion and address
                                       concerns. Seek counsel guidance if necessary in drafting a cover letter.
                                    











5.11.6.17 
                                (09-26-2014)Levy on Long-Term Care Facilities
                           







The following information provides guidance when it may be necessary to levy the primary source of income for a long-term
                              care (LTC) provider/facility that impacts the facilities ability to continue to operate. Levies may leave patients at risk
                              if there is no other facility in the area.
                           


These facilities are generally referred to as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the Medicare program and as nursing facilities
                              (NFs) in the Medicaid program 
                           


Because these types of cases involve patient welfare the determination to levy should consider whether the LTC facility is
                              non-compliant, uncooperative pyramiding and unable to pay. Discuss the potential sensitive case issues with the manager when
                              enforcement may be necessary and document the case with alternative methods of collection considered prior to levy. Document
                              this discussion and managers concurrence with plan of action in the ICS history.
                           


 Many LTC facilities receive Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded subsidies, through the state health services agency.
                              Levy of the primary income source may have an adverse financial impact, compelling the owners to close the business. Levies
                              may leave patients at risk if there is no other facility in the area. To determine if alternate facilities are available,
                              notify the appropriate state agency in advance of potential enforcement action. 
                           


When contacting the state prior to levy:



Guard against disclosure violations and only share general information about the levy process, regardless if a Notice of Federal
                                       Tax Lien has been filed.
                                    


Ask the contact if there are other facilities in the area to relocate the patients.

Note:
Generally, each state has a patient relocation plan in effect. If a care facility closes, the IRS is not responsible for relocating
                                          the patients. In many cases, the state will assist with patient relocation. Furthermore, Section 6113 of the “Patient Protection
                                          and Affordable Care Act” under section, 1128I (h) mandates specific procedures in the event of a SNF or NF closure. These
                                          procedures help protect the resident, the resident’s family, and visitors because they require the facility administrator
                                          to provide an organized plan to the state that allows the resident to make the necessary adjustments within a reasonable time
                                          frame. The plan must be submitted and approved by the state agency at least 60 days prior to the impending closure. 
                                       






An additional source for LTC facilities can be found on CMS web page titled Nursing Home Compare that has detailed information
                              about every Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing home in the country. The web page address is http://www.medicare.gov/nhcompare/include/datasection/questions/proximitysearch.asp?bhcp=1.







5.11.6.17.1 
                                   (03-28-2016)Additional Levy Considerations
                              







Major sources of income for LTC can be a combination of private payments from relatives and government funding.


Review of LTC bank deposit items will help determine the identity of any residents for whom rent is paid by a family member
                                 directly to the SNF operator entity. A levy may be issued to those family members to attach those funds, which are generally
                                 due on a monthly basis. Follow the procedure in IRM 5.11.6.17 when determining whether to issue a levy to a family member
                              


Because most patients who require LTC become insolvent at some point due to the cost, most occupy Medicaid authorized beds.
                                 The SNF operator is reimbursed on a per diem basis from the Medicaid program for care of the patient in each Medicaid authorized
                                 bed that is occupied on a particular day. These per diem funds are the primary source of income for most SNFs. In order to
                                 levy effectively and capture all of the funds being paid by Medicaid to the operator, levies need to be sent DAILY. It is
                                 highly recommended that arrangements be made in advance to fax the levies directly to the Accounts Payable Department for
                                 your state’s administering agency and to confirm receipt on the same day. 
                              


The SNF operator bills Medicare for any medical services provided, whether for doctors on staff, rehab services, medication,
                                 or other type of medical service provided to the patient. Claims for these services are paid by Medicare Administrative Contractors
                                 referred to as MACs. Once a claim has been approved for payment, there is a minimum 14 day aging period during which the funds
                                 must be held by CMS before the payment can be released to the medical provider (14 days for claims submitted electronically
                                 and 28 days for claims submitted via paper). In order to capture all payments aging in the system and/or due to be released
                                 at any given time to medical provider, a new levy should be issued to the appropriate MAC every 14 days. 
                              


The CMS maintains a web page that contains locations for MACs jurisdictions, their definitions, and who holds the contract
                                 currently. The web page address is https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-Contractors/MedicareAdministrativeContractors.html. To locate an MAC access the web page and search Who are the MACS based upon MACs by State. Then follow the links to locate your geographic region and MAC contact information.
                              









5.11.6.18 
                                (03-28-2014)Levy on Qualified Tuition Program
                           







Qualified tuition programs (QTPs) are also called “529 plans.” QTPs allows for either the prepayment or the contribution to
                              an account established for paying, a student’s qualified educational expenses at an eligible educational institution. The
                              QTP designated beneficiary is usually the student or future student for whom the plan is intended to provide benefits. The
                              tax benefit of a QTP is that no tax is due on a distribution unless the amount distributed is greater than the beneficiary’s
                              adjusted qualified education expense. 
                           

Note:
Section 530 (Coverdell education saving accounts) which, like 529 plans, are not exempt from levy, but differ in that  the
                                 person setting up a Coverdell ESA does not has the right to withdraw the funds.  Those funds are held for the benefit of the
                                 beneficiary
                              



There are two basic types: prepaid tuition plans and savings plans. Generally, each state has its own plan and each is unique.
                              States are permitted to offer both types. A qualified education institution can only offer a prepaid tuition type 529 plan.
                           

Note:
While a levy attaches to either plan additional information may be required to determine the taxpayer's rights for converting
                                 a prepaid tuition plan to cash. If there are questions on liquidating a prepaid tuition plan seek advice from Collection Advisory
                                 and Associate Area Counsel.
                              



Whoever purchases the QTP is the custodian and controls the funds until they are withdrawn. Prior to levying on a QTP you
                              should determine who the custodian of the QTP plan is and what rights they have for taking a distribution. If there are questions
                              on who owns the account levied seek advice from AI - Advisory and Associate Area Counsel. 
                           


Because the QTP provides for the student’s qualified educational expenses, discuss the levy with appropriate manager if unique
                              case facts or potentially sensitive issues are known that may affect the levy determination.
                           


The IRC 529 does not provide a levy exception for the 10 percent additional tax on taxable distributions from a Qualified
                              Tuition Program.
                           


See Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education for general information on QTP.
