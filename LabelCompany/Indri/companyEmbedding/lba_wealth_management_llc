What are analysts saying about Ecolab stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Ecolab stock: 
1. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "We find Ecolab very well positioned to benefit from the convergence of population growth, resource volatility and rapid industrialization across the world. The company’s recurring services model drives high visibility (even in a variable macro environment)." (3/15/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Ecolab Inc. exited fourth quarter 2016 on a tepid note missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. The downside came mainly from lower-than-expected volume in the energy and institutional businesses. Nevertheless, we believe that a robust product portfolio and an expanding customer base will drive organic sales. In fact, the realization of targeted synergies associated with acquisitions should also pave way for margin expansion. Also management expects the tide to turn in 2017 wherein higher margins and volumes are expected to bring in good tides for the industrial segment. The company expects water, food and beverage, and paper businesses all to benefit in 2017. Finally the stocks overvaluation reflects a relatively dull scenario that might be a cause for investors’ concern." (2/24/2017)

LBA Wealth Management LLC is a fee-only investment advisory firm that operated with seven professionals managing $350 million in assets. The Florida market will be a "stronghold" for BDO's continued expansion of its wealth advisory practice throughout the Southeast, according to a statement by BDO.




"LBA’s experience working with high-net worth clients in Jacksonville, Gainesville and throughout North Florida, combined with our previous expansion in South Florida last year, greatly increases our wealth management resources in the state of Florida," said Steve Parish, National Leader of Wealth Advisory Services at BDO USA.
David Albaneze, who was the chief investment strategist at LBA Wealth Management, said when the LBA Group joined BDO, the company began working on joining BDO's wealth advisory practice.
“As part of a national firm, our clients will have access to a wider range of services and our people will have access to many more opportunities to pursue career growth," he said.
BDO USA has about 400 staff serving Florida businesses in offices in Coral Gables, Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Lakeland, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, West Palm Beach and Winter Haven.

Derek covers commercial and residential real estate and related industries as well as economic development and health care.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



          1. $4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online. The study found on average that four competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.65 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. For the table, the example competitor trade costs range of $240 - $510 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential between Fidelity and the four selected competitors displayed in the table. Year to date, through September 2015, Fidelity's retail brokerage account holders who purchased individual municipal or corporate bonds, purchased an average of 22 bonds per transaction.
	
    

          3.
	
	
	       
					
Minimum concessions of $19.95 apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S. Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades, reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. dollar–denominated bonds; additional fees and minimums apply for non-dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply; see Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may affect the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.



          4.
	
	
	       
        Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund’s current prospectus.


          5. Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy and Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. For taxable accounts, Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy may apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques on a limited basis at Strategic Advisers' discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. As a discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor's account that Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy, Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios, and/or Fidelity® Equity Income Strategy do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          6. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.


There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.



ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.



For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.


          Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®, Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines, and BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio are services provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines includes the Breckinridge Intermediate Municipal Separately Managed Account, the Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy, and the Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy. Fidelity GoSM is a service provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., and by Geode Capital Management LLC, an unaffiliated registered investment adviser. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., or Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank. Nondeposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and its affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These advisory services are provided for a fee.


          Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and members of NYSE and SIPC.
	
    


Before investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you should consider its investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.
Learn More



Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.
