Explanation of Responses:

1. Cancelled pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 30, 2016 by and among the Issuer, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. ("Lions Gate"), and Orion Arm Acquisition Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Lions Gate.

2. On December 7, 2016, LG Leopard Canada LP, an Ontario limited partnership, dissolved and distributed all of its assets to its sole general partner, LG Leopard GP Canada Inc. and its sole limited partner, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. ("Lions Gate"). The distributed assets consisted solely of Starz Series A Common Stock and Starz Series B Common Stock directly held by LG Leopard Canada LP. Immediately following the distribution, LG Leopard GP Canada Inc. transferred its interest in the distributed assets to Lions Gate. As a result of these transactions, neither LG Leopard Canada LP nor LG Leopard GP Canada Inc. has any remaining interest in the shares of Starz Series A Common Stock and Starz Series B Common Stock described in this report.

3. The shares of Starz Series A Common Stock and Starz Series B Common Stock described in this report were, immediately prior to their cancellation, held by Orion Arm Holding Co., LLC ("HoldCo"), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Lions Gate. By virtue of Lions Gate's capacity as the ultimate parent of HoldCo, Lions Gate may be deemed to have beneficially owned the shares held by HoldCo.
