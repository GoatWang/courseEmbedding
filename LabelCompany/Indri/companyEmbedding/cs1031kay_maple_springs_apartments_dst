Capital Square 1031 and Kay Properties Acquire 268-Unit Multi-Family Community in Richmond, Virginia’s West End




















December 14, 2016 12:22 ET

 | Source: Capital Square 1031, LLC; Kay Properties & Investments, LLC






RICHMOND, Va., Dec.  14, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Square 1031 and Kay Properties & Investments announced today the acquisition of the Maple Springs Apartments, a 268-unit multi-family community located in Richmond, Virginia’s West End. Maple Springs Apartments is comprised of 23 two-story residential buildings and a clubhouse, situated on 18.5 acres of land. Located at 5624 Maple Run Lane, the community features a mix of studio, one-, and two-bedroom units ranging in size from 434 square feet to 864 square feet. Maple Springs Apartments includes 425 parking spaces. The property was approximately 95 percent occupied at the time of acquisition. “Prior to Capital Square and Kay’s combined acquisition of Maple Springs Apartments, the seller completed extensive common area and interior apartment upgrades which have positioned the property as a high quality apartment community,” said Seth Harris, executive vice president and head of acquisitions at Capital Square 1031. “Adding to its attractiveness, the community enjoys an enviable location in Richmond’s West End, one of the city’s top residential markets that has consistently achieved strong rent growth and low vacancy rates. Capital Square is pleased to add this property to its assets under management, now including 58 real estate assets valued at approximately $566 million, based on investment cost,” said Louis Rogers, founder and chief executive officer of Capital Square 1031. Maple Springs Apartments is surrounded by employment centers, medical services, shopping, schools, recreation and entertainment options for residents. Community amenities include a clubhouse with Wi-Fi, a fitness center, lounge, coffee bar and tanning salon. The property also features a two-tiered swimming pool with a waterfall and hot tub, tennis and volleyball courts, a grill/picnic area, walking/biking trails and a dog park. Interior unit amenities include a washer/dryer set, walk-in closets, ceiling fans and fireplaces with mantles. Second-floor units also feature vaulted ceilings. Maple Springs Apartments is part of a Delaware statutory trust (DST) offering, CS1031/Kay Maple Springs Apartments, DST. “We are excited to partner with Capital Square on another joint venture DST offering,” said Dwight Kay, founder and chief executive officer of Kay Properties & Investments. “The CS1031/Kay Maple Springs Apartments, DST is a high quality multi-family opportunity that we believe to be well located as it is across the street from the Parham Doctors’ Hospital and just minutes from the Innsbrook Corporate Center, an 8-million-square-foot office park with approximately 20,000 employees. We were attracted to Maple Springs due to its favorable purchase price per unit along with our new, 10-year loan from Fannie Mae, which is fixed at 3.5 percent.” With an area population of 1.3 million and approximately 225,000 residents within the city, the Richmond metropolitan statistical area has produced nearly six years of year-over-year employment growth. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Richmond metro area added 20,100 jobs for the year ending July 2016, reflecting an annual growth of 3.1 percent. As of September 2016, the metropolitan area has an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, 90 basis points lower than the U.S. average during the same month. The city is home to one of 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. There are 10 Fortune 1000 Companies within Richmond, including Altria Group, CarMax, Dominion Resources, Genworth, Owens and Minor, WestRock, Markel, Brink’s, Universal and NewMarket.

What is a DST 1031 Property?
 
 

By: Dwight Kay, Founder – Kay Properties and Investments, LLC
A DST stands for Delaware Statutory Trust and is an entity that is used to hold  title to investment real estate. In some ways this is similar to how a limited liability company or an LLC can hold title to real estate however, unlike an LLC, a property structured DST property will qualify as like kind exchange property for a 1031 exchange according to the IRS revenue ruling 2004-86.
The typical minimum investment for a DST 1031 Property is $100,000 allowing an investor to diversify his or her exchange proceeds among multiple properties. DST 1031 properties also have various leverage ratios to potentially satisfy an investors exchange requirements of taking on equal or greater debt.  
The typical loan to value of a DST 1031 property is 50% however, some DST properties are offered all cash/no debt in order to eliminate all financing risks. Kay properties and investments is a real estate wealth advisory firm that specializes in DST 1031 properties. Call us today to receive a free list of our current DST 1031 properties.

Capital Square 1031 Joint Venture Buys Richmond Multifamily Property
Capital Square 1031, a sponsor of replacement property for Section 1031 exchanges, and Kay Properties & Investments, a provider of DST brokerage and advisory services, have purchased Maple Springs Apartments, a 268-unit multi-family community located in Richmond, Virginia’s West End. Maple Springs Apartments is part of a Delaware statutory trust offering, CS1031/Kay Maple Springs Apartments DST. 
  Maple Springs Apartments is comprised of 23 two-story residential buildings and a clubhouse, situated on 18.5 acres of land. Located at 5624 Maple Run Lane, the community features a mix of studio, one-, and two-bedroom units ranging in size from 434 square feet to 864 square feet. Maple Springs Apartments includes 425 parking spaces and was approximately 95 percent occupied at the time of acquisition.
  “Prior to Capital Square and Kay’s combined acquisition of Maple Springs Apartments, the seller completed extensive common area and interior apartment upgrades which have positioned the property as a high-quality apartment community,” said Seth Harris, executive vice president and head of acquisitions at Capital Square 1031. 





  “Adding to its attractiveness, the community enjoys an enviable location in Richmond’s West End, one of the city’s top residential markets that has consistently achieved strong rent growth and low vacancy rates. Capital Square is pleased to add this property to its assets under management, now including 58 real estate assets valued at approximately $566 million, based on investment cost,” said Louis Rogers, founder and chief executive officer of Capital Square 1031.
  Maple Springs Apartments is surrounded by employment centers, medical services, shopping, schools, recreation and entertainment options for residents. Community amenities include a clubhouse with Wi-Fi, a fitness center, lounge, coffee bar and tanning salon. The property also features a two-tiered swimming pool with a waterfall and hot tub, tennis and volleyball courts, a grill/picnic area, walking/biking trails and a dog park. Interior unit amenities include a washer/dryer set, walk-in closets, ceiling fans and fireplaces with mantles. Second-floor units also feature vaulted ceilings.
  Capital Square 1031 sponsors institutional-quality real estate exchange programs that qualify for tax deferral under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. The firm provides a range of services, including due diligence, acquisition, loan sourcing, property management/asset management, and disposition for high net worth investors, private equity firms, family offices and institutional investors. As of December 7, the firm oversees a growing national portfolio of 56 real estate assets valued at approximately $566 million (based on investment cost).
