Municipal Bonds: Three reasons to consider investing










Why municipals?

Income: Municipal bonds continue to represent an attractive source of income, despite much-talked-about tax reform and its potential implications.
Quality and diversification: With an average rating of AA, the muni market remains of high quality and the asset class has a negative correlation to equities, making them effective portfolio diversifiers.
Value:The "price gap" between Election Day and today is where opportunity may reside.

SEE WHY MUNIS MAKE SENSE






 







“

Municipal bonds help you keep more of what you earn given their tax-exempt nature.
”


 Peter Hayes, Head of BlackRock's Municipal Bonds Group




Peter Hayes








Why BlackRock for municipals?
The fixed income quality you expect at a low cost

Established Quality and Performance: 7 of our municipal bond funds delivered 1st quartile Morningstar performance over 10 years.†
Competitive Value: 7 of our municipal bond funds are priced in the least expensive quartile.‡ 
The BlackRock Advantage: As one of the largest and most experienced municipal bond managers, our insight, access and technology has helped investors pursue their goals.

†As of 3/31/2017. Source: Morningstar. All data is based on the institutional share class of the funds. BlackRock manages a total of 8 open-end municipal mutual funds. Rankings are based on the total return excluding sales charge. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
 
To obtain more information on the funds including the other Morningstar time period rankings, please visit: California Municipal Opportunities Fund, High Yield Municipal Fund, National Municipal Fund, New Jersey Municipal Bond Fund, Short-Term Municipal Fund, Strategic Municipal Opportunities Fund, New York Municipal Opportunities Fund, Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Fund.
 
‡ As of 03/31/17. Source: Morningstar. Analysis based only on institutional shares of BlackRock active fixed income funds vs. institutional shares of active fixed income funds within their respective Morningstar categories. Expenses are based on the funds’ most recent prospectus net expense ratios, excluding investment dividend expense, interest expense, and certain other fund expenses. Morningstar category net expense ratio also excludes these expenses. Includes active open-end tax-free fixed income mutual funds only, and excludes index funds. 7 out of 8 of BlackRock's active tax-free fixed income funds are in the lowest fee quartile. Based on 8 BlackRock tax-free funds. Institutional shares may not be available to all retail investors. Performance for different share classes may vary.
 






The performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data current to the most recent month end may be obtained by visiting the products' respective overview pages.






Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






The funds may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.






There may be less information on the financial condition of municipal issuers than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Some investors may be subject to federal or state income taxes or the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable.

State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?
06/21/2017

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Municipal Bond Trust’s (BBK) (the 'Trust') investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax. The Trust
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from regular federal income taxes (except that the interest may
be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax). The Trust invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in municipal bonds that
are investment grade quality. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.






Growth of Hypothetical $10,000 The growth of hypothetical $10,000 chart reflects a hypothetical $10,000 investment and assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses were deducted.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Premium/Discount
The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

as of 21-Jul-2017



4.84%




Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

as of 21-Jul-2017



8.55%




Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

as of 30-Jun-2017

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

Ratings

 Ratings



Morningstar Rating

Overall Municipal Bond Trust received a Morningstar Rating of 4 stars for the 3-year period, 4 stars for the 5-year period and 4 stars for the 10-year period, rated against 64, 60 and 56 Muni National Long Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's Portfolio - BlackRock Build America Bond Trust (NYSE:BBN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's PortfolioJul.20.17 | About: BlackRock Build (BBN) David Hsu Special situations, long only, bonds, Deep ValueSummaryBlackrock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust is the largest closed-end mutual fund specializing in Build America Bonds.Public sources, including CEFConnect, Morningstar, and BlackRock, have confusing data about key portfolio characteristics such as yield to maturity, duration, and bond price.I calculate the yield to maturity, bond price, and effective duration for each of the 134 bonds in BBN's portfolio and provide a worksheet.BlackRock Taxable Municipal America Bond Trust (BBN) is the largest and highest-yielding closed-end mutual fund that specializes in Build America Bonds, a special class of taxable municipal securities issued pursuant to the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In an earlier article (“Build America Bonds: the Impact of Yield Chasing”), I warned about the potential risks to these funds due to low net asset value discount and high interest rate sensitivity. In this article, I show that for the average investor, finding disclosure about some of the key bond-related metrics can be confusing due to the rather limited and non-standardized disclosures required of closed-end bond funds. So let’s see what different data sources report on key risk and yield metrics for BBN. CEFConnect And Morningstar First, let’s look at CEFConnect. Under the tab “Portfolio Characteristics,” it reports an Average Coupon of 10.60%, Average Maturity of 34.36 years, but sadly no YTM. Interestingly enough, neither Average Coupon nor Average Maturity look right, which we’ll get to later. 

 Source: CEFConnect website. Next, let’s try Morningstar. Under the “Portfolio” tab, we can see a weighted average coupon of “7” (sorry, folks, no decimals reported here), and weighted average bond price of $119. Sadly, there is no mention of yield to maturity.
 

 For duration, they report an unadjusted duration of 7.30 years, and a leverage adjusted duration of 11.62 years. So these are starting to look more plausible, but let’s investigate further. 

Source: Morningstar BlackRock BlackRock provides a fact sheet and a website summary. First, at their website, we found the following as of July 19. Here, they show YTM of 6.51%, average coupon of 10.17%, weighted average maturity of 32.24 years, and effective duration of 11.07 years. 

Source: Blackrock website BlackRock’s latest fact sheet is from March 2017 and can be found at this link. The second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of 6.85%, effective duration of 10.97 years, and weighted average life [WAL] to worst of 24.23 years (it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage). 


 Below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity, duration, and YTM:   Source Maturity (NYSE:Y) Duration (Y) YTM (%) Coupon (%) Bond Price   CEFConnect 34.36     10.60     Morningstar 34.36 11.62   7 119   BlackRock website 32.24 11.07 6.51       BlackRock factsheet 24.23 10.97 6.85       Deep Dive Into BBN Holdings After reading these different data sources, something didn’t look right to me. First, CEFConnect’s coupon looked too high. In the 2008-2009 time period when the BABs were being offered to the market, most were paying coupons in the 6% to 7% range at issuance. There were a few higher rate, but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over 10%. Second, the yield to maturity looked high. A quick scan of some Build America Bond CUSIPs indicated that individual bond YTMs were clustered in the high 4s to low 6s, so I didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach 6.85%. Two phone calls to BlackRock did not help clarify matters, as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of: Yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price. For bonds that are callable, we used the yield to worst. I have to say, they train them for consistency at BlackRock, as I got the same speech from both representatives. Unfortunately, they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio YTM could be higher than the component bond YTMs. So I decided to verify this for myself. As the different data sources varied, I figured the only way to convince myself of the YTM and duration was to look at each of the 134 individual holdings listed in their portfolio. I used the latest semiannual report from January 31, 2017, as the main data source. In that report, they helpfully report details about the issuer, coupon rate, maturity, par value, and market value for each of the 134 distinct bond holdings in the BBN portfolio. An example follows below:
 

 Source: Sample information from Blackrock BBN semi-annual report. Armed with this information, one can calculate duration and YTM. The bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using Excel’s YIELD function, and the duration can be calculated using the MDURATION function. So I entered all 134 holdings into excel and calculated the price, YTM and duration for each of their holdings. The results are pictured below, and I make my excel sheet available on my OneDrive. 

Source: BBN semi-annual report January 31, 2017 and author’s calculations. Using market-value-based weightings (par value and duration weightings are very similar), I get an average coupon of 6.47%, WAL of 24.8 years, average bond price of $118, YTM of 5.19%, and a duration of 12.6 years. These numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the Build America Bond market. Analysis of BBN Distributions The current gross income of the BBN portfolio is $110 million a year. This is calculated using the average coupon rate of 6.41% times' par value of $1.726 billion. The net asset value is $1.3 billion ($2 billion in gross market value less $704 million in short-term loans), which means the gross investment income yield is 8.52%. Management fees are $12.6 million (0.91% of NAV), and interest expense is running at about $7 million (0.54% of NAV). This results in net investment income of $91 million a year, or about 7%, which compares very favorably to the 7.06% distribution in their factsheet.
 

 Future Amortization Of Premium Due to the lower interest rate environment compared to 2009-2010, most of the bonds in BBN’s portfolio are selling at a premium. I calculated a weighted average premium of 18%. Assuming that this premium is amortized over the weighted average life of 24.8 years, this is an erosion of 0.72% in the gross bond value every year. Because of the 35% leverage, this translates to a 1.12% a year decline in the NAV as these bonds will trend towards par as they approach maturity. Interest Rate Risks And Impact Of Leverage If the true YTM of the portfolio is 6.85%, then this looks like a low-risk and sustainable distribution. But the portfolio is not really a $1.3 billion portfolio of bonds with a 6.85% YTM. BBN is actually $2 billion of bonds with a 5.2% YTM and a $700 million loan, which is currently costing them 1%. Consider a scenario where long-term rates stay the same (so the value of the municipal bonds doesn’t change) but short-term cost of borrowing increases from 1% to 3%. Now the interest cost goes to $21 million or 1.62% of NAV. Now the distributable net income rate is 5.92%. This drop in income can happen in a situation where there is no change in long-term bond rates, where all the rising rates are on near-term debt (illustration below). 

 Finally, let’s consider a case of a 50bp increase in long-term rates, which leads to a decline in value of the overall bonds of 6.3% (using my calculated 12.6 year duration). In this illustration, there is no change in income, as the short-term rates have been kept constant at 1%, and only long-term rates increased by 0.5% leading to a price impact. This leads to a 6.3% drop in the gross value of the portfolio, which is a 9.7% drop in the NAV.
 

 Call Risk Though I am not an expert on the call characteristics of the individual bonds in BBN’s portfolio, a commenter on my other article pointed out several Build America Bonds that had been called. This is an additional risk to BBN, as premium bonds that are called are only paid their par value. BlackRock reports that 33% of their bonds are callable in the next 5 years, with a total of 40% of the bond portfolio subject to calls anytime in their lifetime. 

 Conclusion Bonds are complicated, and closed-end bond funds such as BBN even more so. Unfortunately, mandatory disclosures by closed-end funds are not particularly effective at communicating the risk characteristics of their portfolio in ways that are easily understood. Closed-end bond funds disclose data on net asset value, NAV discount, and distribution yield in fairly reliable and standardized formats. However, for closed-end funds that specialize in bonds, the disclosure about key variables of yield to maturity, bond premium, and duration has not been effectively standardized in the industry, so it can be more challenging to understand the risk characteristics of the bond fund. In the specific case of BBN, the largest Build America Bond closed-end mutual fund, we can see that the reported Yield to Maturity is much higher than the weighted average yield to maturity of the individual bonds. This is likely to do with how BlackRock deals with leverage, though I must admit that the specifics of their math escapes me.
 In terms of what this means for my investment thesis on BBN, I reiterate the views of my earlier article as follows:  Built-in slow but steady drag on NAV due to amortization of bond price premium, price risk due to long duration and leverage, no buffer from discount to NAV, and  potential distribution cut due to rising short-term borrowing rates (this is a new bonus worry after my deep-dive analysis).  Now, I want to make a point that I think that BlackRock has done a fine job with the construction of BBN's portfolio, paying a manageable distribution from net investment income, and providing pretty good information about the details of their portfolio. I know, because I owned BBN from late 2013 to last week and received lots of high distributions (started at almost 9% if I remember correctly) and a capital gain of 27% as a nice bonus. Where there is room for improvement is for more disclosure on the bond premiums, gross yield to maturity and duration (before leverage), and cost of leverage and hedging practices. This information can provide more insight, especially in markets where interest rate markets are starting to turn.

A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's Portfolio - BlackRock Build America Bond Trust (NYSE:BBN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's PortfolioJul.20.17 | About: BlackRock Build (BBN) David Hsu Special situations, long only, bonds, Deep ValueSummaryBlackrock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust is the largest closed-end mutual fund specializing in Build America Bonds.Public sources, including CEFConnect, Morningstar, and BlackRock, have confusing data about key portfolio characteristics such as yield to maturity, duration, and bond price.I calculate the yield to maturity, bond price, and effective duration for each of the 134 bonds in BBN's portfolio and provide a worksheet.BlackRock Taxable Municipal America Bond Trust (BBN) is the largest and highest-yielding closed-end mutual fund that specializes in Build America Bonds, a special class of taxable municipal securities issued pursuant to the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In an earlier article (“Build America Bonds: the Impact of Yield Chasing”), I warned about the potential risks to these funds due to low net asset value discount and high interest rate sensitivity. In this article, I show that for the average investor, finding disclosure about some of the key bond-related metrics can be confusing due to the rather limited and non-standardized disclosures required of closed-end bond funds. So let’s see what different data sources report on key risk and yield metrics for BBN. CEFConnect And Morningstar First, let’s look at CEFConnect. Under the tab “Portfolio Characteristics,” it reports an Average Coupon of 10.60%, Average Maturity of 34.36 years, but sadly no YTM. Interestingly enough, neither Average Coupon nor Average Maturity look right, which we’ll get to later. 

 Source: CEFConnect website. Next, let’s try Morningstar. Under the “Portfolio” tab, we can see a weighted average coupon of “7” (sorry, folks, no decimals reported here), and weighted average bond price of $119. Sadly, there is no mention of yield to maturity.
 

 For duration, they report an unadjusted duration of 7.30 years, and a leverage adjusted duration of 11.62 years. So these are starting to look more plausible, but let’s investigate further. 

Source: Morningstar BlackRock BlackRock provides a fact sheet and a website summary. First, at their website, we found the following as of July 19. Here, they show YTM of 6.51%, average coupon of 10.17%, weighted average maturity of 32.24 years, and effective duration of 11.07 years. 

Source: Blackrock website BlackRock’s latest fact sheet is from March 2017 and can be found at this link. The second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of 6.85%, effective duration of 10.97 years, and weighted average life [WAL] to worst of 24.23 years (it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage). 


 Below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity, duration, and YTM:   Source Maturity (NYSE:Y) Duration (Y) YTM (%) Coupon (%) Bond Price   CEFConnect 34.36     10.60     Morningstar 34.36 11.62   7 119   BlackRock website 32.24 11.07 6.51       BlackRock factsheet 24.23 10.97 6.85       Deep Dive Into BBN Holdings After reading these different data sources, something didn’t look right to me. First, CEFConnect’s coupon looked too high. In the 2008-2009 time period when the BABs were being offered to the market, most were paying coupons in the 6% to 7% range at issuance. There were a few higher rate, but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over 10%. Second, the yield to maturity looked high. A quick scan of some Build America Bond CUSIPs indicated that individual bond YTMs were clustered in the high 4s to low 6s, so I didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach 6.85%. Two phone calls to BlackRock did not help clarify matters, as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of: Yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price. For bonds that are callable, we used the yield to worst. I have to say, they train them for consistency at BlackRock, as I got the same speech from both representatives. Unfortunately, they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio YTM could be higher than the component bond YTMs. So I decided to verify this for myself. As the different data sources varied, I figured the only way to convince myself of the YTM and duration was to look at each of the 134 individual holdings listed in their portfolio. I used the latest semiannual report from January 31, 2017, as the main data source. In that report, they helpfully report details about the issuer, coupon rate, maturity, par value, and market value for each of the 134 distinct bond holdings in the BBN portfolio. An example follows below:
 

 Source: Sample information from Blackrock BBN semi-annual report. Armed with this information, one can calculate duration and YTM. The bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using Excel’s YIELD function, and the duration can be calculated using the MDURATION function. So I entered all 134 holdings into excel and calculated the price, YTM and duration for each of their holdings. The results are pictured below, and I make my excel sheet available on my OneDrive. 

Source: BBN semi-annual report January 31, 2017 and author’s calculations. Using market-value-based weightings (par value and duration weightings are very similar), I get an average coupon of 6.47%, WAL of 24.8 years, average bond price of $118, YTM of 5.19%, and a duration of 12.6 years. These numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the Build America Bond market. Analysis of BBN Distributions The current gross income of the BBN portfolio is $110 million a year. This is calculated using the average coupon rate of 6.41% times' par value of $1.726 billion. The net asset value is $1.3 billion ($2 billion in gross market value less $704 million in short-term loans), which means the gross investment income yield is 8.52%. Management fees are $12.6 million (0.91% of NAV), and interest expense is running at about $7 million (0.54% of NAV). This results in net investment income of $91 million a year, or about 7%, which compares very favorably to the 7.06% distribution in their factsheet.
 

 Future Amortization Of Premium Due to the lower interest rate environment compared to 2009-2010, most of the bonds in BBN’s portfolio are selling at a premium.

Invesco Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. CCI may also be used to assist with the discovery of divergences that could possibly signal reversal moves.
Moving average indicators are used widely for stock analysis. The Schaff Trend Cycle indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. The STC indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100.BlackRock Municipal Bond Trust earned a coverage optimism score of -0.25 on Accern's scale. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line.The Williams %R is created to provide a general sense of when the equity might have reached an extreme and be primed for a reversal.

Invesco Advantage Municipal Income Tr II (NYSEMKT:VKI) has declined 9.07% since July 18, 2016 and is downtrending. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend.

					The team has been clicking on all cylinders, and are quickly gaining ground on the NL Central leading Milwaukee Brewers . In Monday's opener, the Cubs eked out a 4-3 win. "I did my best to give the team a chance to win".
				Oversold values are 0 to 20 and investors might look to buy dips in up trends when the signal line crosses up from below 20 to above 20. The ADX is often used along with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of the trend. Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.Investors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Many traders will use a combination of moving averages with different time frames to help review stock trend direction. MFS Municipal Income Trust (MFM)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R now sits at -28.12. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold. The 14-day RSI is now sitting at 54.60, the 7-day is at 59.05, and the 3-day is spotted at 67.54. The stock of Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV) has "Hold" rating given on Monday, June 19 by Keefe Bruyette & Woods. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. The RSI is considered to be an internal strength indicator, not to be confused with relative strength which is compared to other stocks and indices. One of the more popular combinations is to use the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.The MACD is calculated by subtracting the value of a 26-day exponential moving average from a 12-day exponential moving average. Accern also assigned media headlines about the investment management company an impact score of 0 out of 100, meaning that recent press coverage is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the stock's share price in the near term.As soon as an individual decides what they want out of their investments, they can start formulating the best way to accomplish those goals.

BlackRock Announces Closing of Reorganization of Two BlackRock 
      Municipal Closed-End Funds






May 16, 2016 09:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Advisors, LLC today announced that the reorganization of 
      BlackRock Municipal Bond Investment Trust (NYSE:BIE) with and into 
      BlackRock Municipal Income Investment Trust (NYSE:BBF and, together with 
      BIE, the “Funds”) (the “Reorganization”) is effective as of the opening 
      for business of the New York Stock Exchange on May 16, 2016.
    

      In the Reorganization, common shareholders of BIE received an amount of 
      BBF common stock equal to the aggregate net asset value of their 
      holdings of BIE common stock as determined at the close of business on 
      May 13, 2016. Fractional shares of BBF common stock were not issued in 
      the Reorganization and consequently cash will be distributed for any 
      such fractional amounts.
    

      Relevant details pertaining to the Reorganization are as follows:

      In addition, BIE preferred shareholders will receive on a one-for-one 
      basis BBF preferred stock in an amount equal to the aggregate preferred 
      share liquidation preference held by BIE preferred shareholders 
      immediately prior to the Reorganization.
    

      This communication is not intended to, and shall not, constitute an 
      offer to purchase or sell shares of any of the BlackRock funds, 
      including BBF, the surviving fund in the Reorganization. Investors 
      should consider BBF’s investment objective, risks, charges and expenses 
      carefully and consider in its entirety the Joint Proxy 
      Statement/Prospectus relating to the Reorganization which contains 
      important information regarding the investment objectives and policies, 
      risks, charges, expenses and other important information about BBF.

      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to a Fund’s or 
      BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or 
      expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by 
      words or phrases such as “trend,” “potential,” “opportunity,” 
      “pipeline,” “believe,” “comfortable,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,” 
      “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,”

      BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to 
      numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. 
      Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and 
      BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update 
      forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from 
      those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could 
      differ materially from historical performance.
    

      With respect to the Funds, the following factors, among others, could 
      cause actual events to differ materially from forward-looking statements 
      or historical performance: (1) changes and volatility in political, 
      economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign 
      exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in 
      changes in demand for the Funds or in a Fund’s net asset value; (2) the 
      relative and absolute investment performance of a Fund and its 
      investments; (3) the impact of increased competition; (4) the 
      unfavorable resolution of any legal proceedings; (5) the extent and 
      timing of any distributions or share repurchases; (6) the impact, extent 
      and timing of technological changes; (7) the impact of legislative and 
      regulatory actions and reforms, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
      Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and regulatory, supervisory or 
      enforcement actions of government agencies relating to a Fund or 
      BlackRock, as applicable; (8) terrorist activities, international 
      hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the 
      general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, 
      specific industries or BlackRock; (9) BlackRock’s ability to attract and 
      retain highly talented professionals; (10) the impact of BlackRock 
      electing to provide support to its products from time to time; and (11) 
      the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or 
      negative performance of products at other financial institutions.
    

      Annual and Semi-Annual Reports and other regulatory filings of the Funds 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are accessible on 
      the SEC's website at www.sec.gov
and on BlackRock’s website at www.blackrock.com, 
      and may discuss these or other factors that affect the Funds. The 
      information contained on BlackRock’s website is not a part of this press

Municipal Bonds: Three reasons to consider investing










Why municipals?

Income: Municipal bonds continue to represent an attractive source of income, despite much-talked-about tax reform and its potential implications.
Quality and diversification: With an average rating of AA, the muni market remains of high quality and the asset class has a negative correlation to equities, making them effective portfolio diversifiers.
Value:The "price gap" between Election Day and today is where opportunity may reside.

SEE WHY MUNIS MAKE SENSE






 







“

Municipal bonds help you keep more of what you earn given their tax-exempt nature.
”


 Peter Hayes, Head of BlackRock's Municipal Bonds Group




Peter Hayes








Why BlackRock for municipals?
The fixed income quality you expect at a low cost

Established Quality and Performance: 7 of our municipal bond funds delivered 1st quartile Morningstar performance over 10 years.†
Competitive Value: 7 of our municipal bond funds are priced in the least expensive quartile.‡ 
The BlackRock Advantage: As one of the largest and most experienced municipal bond managers, our insight, access and technology has helped investors pursue their goals.

†As of 3/31/2017. Source: Morningstar. All data is based on the institutional share class of the funds. BlackRock manages a total of 8 open-end municipal mutual funds. Rankings are based on the total return excluding sales charge. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
 
To obtain more information on the funds including the other Morningstar time period rankings, please visit: California Municipal Opportunities Fund, High Yield Municipal Fund, National Municipal Fund, New Jersey Municipal Bond Fund, Short-Term Municipal Fund, Strategic Municipal Opportunities Fund, New York Municipal Opportunities Fund, Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Fund.
 
‡ As of 03/31/17. Source: Morningstar. Analysis based only on institutional shares of BlackRock active fixed income funds vs. institutional shares of active fixed income funds within their respective Morningstar categories. Expenses are based on the funds’ most recent prospectus net expense ratios, excluding investment dividend expense, interest expense, and certain other fund expenses. Morningstar category net expense ratio also excludes these expenses. Includes active open-end tax-free fixed income mutual funds only, and excludes index funds. 7 out of 8 of BlackRock's active tax-free fixed income funds are in the lowest fee quartile. Based on 8 BlackRock tax-free funds. Institutional shares may not be available to all retail investors. Performance for different share classes may vary.
 






The performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data current to the most recent month end may be obtained by visiting the products' respective overview pages.






Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






The funds may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.






There may be less information on the financial condition of municipal issuers than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Some investors may be subject to federal or state income taxes or the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable.

State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?
06/21/2017

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

VanEck's suite of municipal income ETFs offers investors the ability to exercise control over their portfolio yield, duration, and credit exposure at different points in the interest rate cycle. The indices underlying each ETF target specific maturity ranges or credit exposures, resulting in distinct performance, yield, and duration characteristics.

Source: VanEck Research. As of 06/30/17. The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance. Effective Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield. This duration measure is appropriate for bonds with embedded options. Yield to Worst measures the lowest of either yield-to-maturity or yield-to-call date on every possible call date.

Yield Curve-Focused ETFs
 Our investment grade municipal ETF product offerings seek to track indices that reflect a unique segmentation of the investment grade municipal yield curve: short (years 1-6: SMB), intermediate (years 6-8: ITMS) (years 6-17: ITM) (years 12-17: ITML), and long (years 17-30+: MLN). 

 
Credit-Focused ETFs
Our credit-focused municipal ETF product offerings seek to track indices that include both the highest credit quality available in the municipal asset class (pre-refunded: PRB) and municipal high yield: short (years 1-12: SHYD) and all maturity (years 1-30+: HYD). The high yield indices include an investment grade component to help enhance liquidity.  


 
Smart Beta ETF
Our smart beta municipal ETF (XMPT) seeks to track an index that includes municipal closed-end funds (CEFs). Because CEFs have a fixed number of shares, discrepancies between NAVs and share prices can be common and generally result from changing investor sentiment. When such a fund's share price is lower than its net asset value (NAV) it's called "being at a discount." When its share price is higher than its NAV it's called "being at a premium."
This index has intelligently designed weighting rules that underweight CEFs trading at higher premiums and overweight CEFs trading at wider discounts. This built-in "buy low, sell high" mechanism is one way investors can potentially benefit from investing in the municipal CEF market.  


 
ETFs Provide Low Cost Access to Munis
The fees of an investment vehicle are important; they affect an investor's ultimate return. The average net expense ratio of municipal bond ETFs was 63 bps lower as compared to municipal bond mutual funds and 77 bps lower as compared to municipal bond closed-end funds. Many investors may prefer municipal bond ETFs for this reason.

 

Source: Morningstar. As of 06/30/17. Fees for municipal bond ETFs compared against the average net expense ratio of mutual funds and closed-end funds in the Morningstar Municipal Bond U.S. Category Group. There were 37 funds in the Muni ETF Category, 1,879 funds in the Muni Mutual Fund Category, 167 funds in the Muni Closed-End Fund Category.

Important Disclosure
Municipal bonds are subject to risks including those related to litigation, legislation, political changes, local business or economic conditions, conditions in underlying sectors, bankruptcy or other changes in the financial condition of the issuer, and/or the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the project or assets, or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. Additional risks include: credit risk, interest rate risk, and call risk. High yield bonds may be subject to a greater risk of loss of income and principal, and are likely to be more sensitive to adverse economic changes than higher rated securities. Some portion of Fund distributions may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
Taxable equivalent yields are used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for federal income taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond investment would have to earn in order to match, after deducting federal income taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond investment. TEY = Tax-Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 -Tax Rate).
The investment management agreement between VanEck Vectors ETF Trust (the "Trust") and Van Eck Associates Corporation (the "Adviser") provides that the Adviser will pay all expenses of the Fund, except for the fee payment under the investment management agreement, interest expense, offering costs, trading expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses. TER, or Total Expense Ratio, is also referred to as "Net Expense Ratio. Expenses for XMPT are capped contractually at 0.40% until 09/01/17. Cap excludes certain expenses, such as interest.
The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Income from corporate bonds is subject to state and Federal tax. There is no guarantee that a Fund's income will be exempt from federal or state income taxes. Federal or state changes in income or alternative minimum tax rates or in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make them less attractive as investments and cause them to lose value. Capital gains, if any, are subject to capital gains tax. Please refer to the Funds' 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            prospectus for complete risk information.
The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors exchange-traded fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called "creation units" and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market.
Investing involves substantial risk, including possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise. Consider a Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses before investing. To obtain a prospectus and summary prospectus, call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com. Read carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
