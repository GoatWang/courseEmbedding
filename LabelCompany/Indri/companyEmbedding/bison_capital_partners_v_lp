About





                "The great value of our partnership was the accessibility of Bison's principals to better define our strategies and think through potential successful outcomes. Bison did what it committed to do, its people are true to their word and I trust each of them implicitly. I welcome the opportunity to partner again with Bison when the opportunity arises."
            

                Andrew Barnett
                former Chief Executive Officer
                The Center for Wound Healing
            






Bison Capital invests in leading middle-market businesses that have significant opportunities for value creation and strong, entrepreneurial management teams which are able to capitalize on their long term potential


                    
            



Flexible, Solution-Oriented Capital for Growth Companies


Bison Capital’s investment approach allows us the flexibility to invest across the entire capital structure, tailoring the structure of each of our investments to the needs and goals of the companies we invest in.  While our investment approach is principally equity-oriented, some portion of our investment is often structured as preferred stock or subordinated debt. Bison Capital’s ability to invest on a non-control basis provides our management partners with the freedom to execute their business plans and maximize their retained ownership. We endeavor to deliver a capital solution that facilitates the growth objectives of each business, allowing management to focus on executing its strategic and operational objectives.




Partnering With Management


A key element of each investment we make is the creation of a partnership between Bison Capital and a company’s management team. Bison Capital’s goal is to align itself with talented and highly-motivated individuals with strong operating backgrounds. We do not manage companies. Instead, we work in collaboration with management teams in order to support their efforts to realize the long-term potential of their businesses. We only invest in situations where the key operators are significant equity holders in the company. Like the management teams and entrepreneurs we partner with, we are committed to long term value creation.




Bison Capital Value Add


Bison Capital participates actively in the board of directors of each of our portfolio companies and supports management through access to our extensive network of outside resources. We assist our companies in the following ways:

​Developing and refining strategic direction
Debt and equity capital markets
Identifying and negotiating acquisitions
Recruiting additional management or board talent
Developing compensation and incentive programs
Enhancing management information tools
Maximizing value for all investors upon exit
