Scale your support without burning holes in your pocket
The next time you need a couple of extra hands on high-traffic support days or before any D-day, simply use day passes by Freshservice to temporarily add extra agents whenever you need them. You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

An actively managed strategy focused on reaping the rewards of market upswings while minimizing the effects of downswings by investing across stocks, bonds and convertible bonds.
Experience our high-conviction approach


Competitive returns


Added value over the long term
			For 20 years, the fund delivered a cumulative return of 428%, outperforming its benchmark and peers at 399% and 263%, respectively.1




Softened downswings


Provided a cushion during previous market downpours
			The fund outperformed its benchmark and peers by an average of 7.58% and 1.72%, respectively, during downturns in 2001, 2002 and 2008.2




Less volatility 


Navigated volatile markets
			The fund outperformed its benchmark and peers with about a third less volatility than the benchmark and in-line with peers.3



The fund returned 428% over the last 20 years1
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $52,777 beating its benchmark and peers.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2016 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


		
		No contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) will be imposed on redemptions of Class C shares following one year from the date shares were purchased. Performance shown at NAV does not include sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.

 About risk
			 


Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the completion of the FRB's quantitative easing program and the "tapering" of other similar foreign central bank actions. This eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Convertible Securities Risk. The market values of convertible securities are affected by market interest rates, the risk of actual issuer default on interest or principal payments and the value of the underlying common stock into which the convertible security may be converted. Additionally, a convertible security is subject to the same types of market and issuer risks as apply to the underlying common stock. In addition, certain convertible securities are subject to involuntary conversions and may undergo principal write-downs upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, and, as a result, are subject to an increased risk of loss.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.
REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. Investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or technological factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of real estate related to the Fund's holdings. Shares of real estate related companies, which tend to be small- and mid-cap companies, may be more volatile and less liquid.
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.

 Executive Remuneration




































Our equity investment philosophy is centered on generating capital appreciation for the investor. The primary emphasis is on providing the investor with a degree of capital appreciation, superior to that of the returns from the equity class as represented by a market index over the longer term. Our core investment premise is that the equity markets are not completely efficient. A well-organized and thorough research effort combined with a disciplined portfolio management approach will enable out performance of the market index over time.  A key pillar of our disciplined approach is to stay true to the mandate of the specific fund as specified in the offer document under all circumstances. This is key to generating superior performance over time even though there could be times when staying true to the mandate may result in short-term underperformance. Our investment philosophy is a matrix framework of Company, Industry, Economic and Technical analysis. The equity team will provide many of the inputs for this framework, but we will also use inputs from external sources as and when required. This open framework is combined with an environment that encourages regular and constant debate; which we believe leads to superior decision making.      Stock categorization system The objective of our stock categorization system is to enable us to identify stocks that are likely to be the best investments from within our universe. Each category of stock has a description of fundamental attributes that we expect the company to possess. The categorizations are as follows:     Stock 
            Category Descriptions 
            (eg.) Growth
            Prospects (eg.) Company Attribute

            competitive Profit leverage   *  P2P - Path to Profit, ROE - Return on Equity   Stocks that fit into one of these categories typically display superior return profiles, but more importantly this enables fund managers to focus on the attributes that drive stock price performance and keep a watch for red flags.     








 The philosophy for managing fixed income portfolios revolves around optimizing risk adjusted returns for the investor by investing in high quality credit assets, managing interest rate risk and minimizing liquidity risk.  Our fixed income investment philosophy is based on a top down research oriented model with focus on economic data analysis. We strive to generate optimized risk adjusted returns by providing for safety of capital, liquidity of funds and investment income for the investors. The portfolios are actively managed for both the interest rate risk, credit and  liquidity risk. The interest rate risk is managed across duration buckets and portfolio composition is managed through active asset allocation across credits and the liquidity risk through a well-diversified portfolio.  The investment team follows a disciplined research oriented investment process to meet fund-specific investment objectives on a long-term investment horizon. The fund manager strives for outperforming the benchmark by selecting
superior credits, based on the in-house analytical credit research and interest rate direction calls without compromising
on the liquidity risk.  The credit risk assessment constitutes an integral part of the investment process and is carried out across sectors covering manufacturing, finance and services. By applying the credit model, we determine and monitor the credit worthiness of an issuer and assess the credit exposure limit. Our internal credit rating acts as a powerful risk containment tool that allow the fund manager to narrow down select credits to match the credit strategies of individual funds.

                                    to participate in the voting process (i.e. exercise voting rights) based on the
                                    philosophy enunciated in this policy.


                                 











                                        Philosophy of Voting Policy

                                         




                             









                                    Good corporate governance ensures that a corporation is managed keeping in mind
                                    the long-term interest of shareholders. Promoting good corporate governance standards
                                    forms an integral part of corporate ownership responsibilities.
                                

                                    With this in the forefront, IAMI expects all corporations, in which it invests in,
                                    to comply with high corporate governance standards. Accordingly, as the decision
                                    to invest is generally an endorsement of sound management practices, IAMI may generally
                                    vote with the management of these corporations. However, when IAMI is of the view
                                    that the unit holders will be prejudiced by any such proposal, then it may vote
                                    against such proposal to protect the interest of unit holders. Also in case of resolutions
                                    moved by the shareholders of the company, IAMI will exercise its voting rights in
                                    the best interest of its unit holders. In certain circumstances, IAMI may also decide
                                    to refrain from voting where it has insufficient information or there is conflict
                                    of interest or it does not have a clear stance on the proposal under consideration.
                                

                                    IAMI, as an investment manager, will generally vote in accordance with the Voting
                                    Policy. However, it may deviate from the policy if there are particular facts and/or
                                    circumstances that warrant for such deviation to protect the interests of unit-holders
                                    of the Fund.
                                


                                 











                                        Conflict of Interest in Exercising Voting Rights

                                         




                             









                                    IAMI, under schemes, may invest in the securities of associate/group companies (to
                                    the extent permitted under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996). Further, IAMI
                                    is an affiliate of a diverse financial services organization consisting of many
                                    affiliates. Moreover IAMI under schemes may invest in securities of companies which
                                    have invested in schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund. Such scenarios may lead to a situation
                                    creating conflict of interest.
                                

                                    In a situation where an investee company, an affiliate or associate/group company
                                    were to approach IAMI with regard to a particular voting decision then such matter
                                    will be referred to the Voting Committee.
                                

                                    IAMI will attempt to avoid conflict of interest and will exercise its voting rights
                                    in the best interest of the unit-holders. Voting decisions in such cases will be
                                    based on merits without any bias and the same parameters will be applied for taking
                                    voting decisions as are applied for other companies.
                                


                                 











                                        Voting Policy Guidelines
                                    

                                         




                             










                                    The matters regarding, but not limited to, which the IAMI may exercise the voting
                                    rights in the Annual General Meeting (AGMs) /Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EGMs)/
                                    Through Postal Ballots/Electronic voting of the investee companies are as follows:
                                


Corporate governance matters, including changes in the state of incorporation, merger
                                            and other corporate restructuring and anti- takeover provisions.
Changes to capital structure, including increase and decrease of capital and preferred
                                            stock issuances.
Stock option plans and other management compensation issues.
Social and corporate responsibility issues.
Appointment and Removal of Directors.
Any other issue that may affect the interest of the shareholders in general and
                                            interest of the unit-holders in particular.


                                    IAMI will exercise voting rights keeping in mind the need to improve economic value
                                    of the companies and importance of protecting the interests of unit holders of its
                                    schemes but subject to importance of the matter and cost/time implications. The
                                    analysts in equity team will make recommendations on key voting issues and same
                                    will be approved by the Head of Equity or in his absence by the Fund Manager. In
                                    case of conflicts or need for a clearer direction, the matter may be referred to
                                    the Voting Committee for its guidance.
                                


                                 











                                        Voting Committee
                                    

                                         




                             










                                    As a guiding principle, IAMI shall exercise voting rights solely in the interest
                                    of unit holders of the Fund. IAMI has constituted a Voting Committee (VC). The Committee
                                    is empowered to provide guidance on the voting matters referred to it, establish
                                    voting guidelines and procedures as it may consider necessary and is responsible
                                    to ensure that these guidelines and procedures are adhered to and also make changes
                                    in the Policy as may be required from time to time. The members of this Committee
                                    are as follows:

Head of Equity or Fund Manager (equity) 
Head of Fixed Income and/ or Fund Managers (fixed income) 
Any other representative as the Committee may co-opt from time to time 


                                    Broad Guidelines for functioning of Voting Committee are:
                                


Voting Committee may record its decisions by circulation including decisions/guidance
                                            on voting matters that have been referred to it. 
Voting Committee may consult with outside experts and other investors on issues
                                            as it may deem fit 
Decisions of Voting Committee should be maintained by compliance 
Details of voting decisions taken by the Fund Management team will be presented
                                            to the Voting Committee/Investment Committee. 
Voting Committee may review this policy from time to time. 



                                 











                                        Steps (Procedure) in Exercising Voting Rights
                                    

                                         




                             










                                    The following points outline the key steps in exercising Voting rights:


Notification of company AGMs / EGMs and relevant voting items to Fund Management
                                            Team.
The IAMI shall endeavor to vote for all holdings of the Fund, aggregated for all
                                            its schemes, but subject to the importance of the matter and the cost/time implications.
                                            The voting will cover all equity holding across all schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.
Custodian will send ballots and or other relevant papers (notice of meeting, proxy
                                            form, attendance slips etc.) to IAMI relating to AGM/EGM as soon as it receives.
The fund management team is authorized to decide on voting decisions but may refer
                                            decisions to the Voting Committee for its guidance/direction.
Based on internal discussion within the fund management team, a decision would be
                                            arrived at as to whether IAMI should vote on the proposed resolution. Routine matters
                                            and ordinary resolutions like adoption of financials (unless there are significant
                                            auditor qualifications), dividend declaration, general updating/corrective amendments
                                            to the Articles of Association would also be considered for voting purpose. However
                                            IAMI may on a case to case basis, not vote on such resolutions, if it deems fit
                                            to do so.
Proposed resolutions would be discussed within the fund management team and decision
                                            would be taken on whether to vote (“for”/”against”) or “abstain” from voting. IAMI
                                            may abstain from voting on proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial
                                            impact on shareholder value and/or matters for which disclosure is inadequate. For
                                            the remaining proposals, IAMI would vote either “for” or “against” based on overall
                                            merits and demerits of the proposed resolution. IAMI will generally support and
                                            vote “for” proposals which are likely to result in maximizing long-term investment
                                            returns for unit holders. IAMI would not support and will vote “against” proposals
                                            that appear to be detrimental to the company financials / interest of the minority
                                            shareholders or which would adversely impact shareholders’ value.
IAMI may exercise its voting rights by authorising its own executives/authorized
                                            representative to attend the AGM/EGM or may instruct the Custodian to exercise voting
                                            rights in accordance with the instructions of IAMI.
IAMI may exercise its voting rights through Postal Ballot or may use Electronic
                                            voting mechanism, wherever available, either through its own executives or by authorizing
                                            the Custodian. The records of voting exercised through Postal Ballot will be maintained
                                            by IAMI.
IAMI may utilize the services of third party professional agencies for getting in-depth
                                            analyses of proposals and vote recommendations. However, the recommendations of
                                            the third party agencies will be non-binding in nature. IAMI will perform due diligence
                                            on proxy voting advisory firms at the time of initial selection as well as at the
                                            time of renewal of services of the proxy voting. The due diligence will be carried
                                            out on parameters viz. resource strength, Companies under coverage, extent of institutional
                                            ownership, depth of analysis, quality of advice / recommendations, analyst access
                                            & support, timely availability of reports, composition of board of directors, advisory
                                            board and top management, web-based interface platform and clientele. 
The rationale supporting each voting decision (For, Against and Abstain) will be
                                            recorded and such records will be retained for number of years (currently 8 years)
                                            as may be required under the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 from time to
                                            time.

Notification of company AGMs / EGMs and relevant voting items to Fund Management
                                            Team.
The IAMI shall endeavor to vote for all holdings of the Fund, aggregated for all
                                            its schemes, but subject to the importance of the matter and the cost/time implications.
                                            The voting will cover all equity holding across all schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.
Custodian will send ballots and or other relevant papers (notice of meeting, proxy
                                            form, attendance slips etc.) to IAMI relating to AGM/EGM as soon as it receives.
The fund management team is authorized to decide on voting decisions but may refer
                                            decisions to the voting committee for its guidance/direction.
Based on internal discussion within the fund management team, a decision would be
                                            arrived at as to whether IAMI should attend the meeting and/or vote on the proposed
                                            resolution. IAMI would not vote for resolutions/matters pertaining to its equity
                                            holdings in quant based funds (arbitrage and Agile). Moreover routine matters and
                                            ordinary resolutions like adoption of financials (unless there are significant auditor
                                            qualifications), dividend declaration, general updating/corrective amendments to
                                            the Articles of Association would be ignored for voting purpose. However IAMI may
                                            on a case to case basis, vote on such resolutions, if it deems fit to do so.
Proposed resolutions which screen through the above criteria would be discussed
                                            within the fund management team and decision would be taken on whether to vote (“for“/“against“)
                                            or “abstain“ from voting. IAMI may abstain from voting on proposals
                                            that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value and/or
                                            matters for which disclosure is inadequate. For the remaining proposals, IAMI would
                                            vote either “for“ or “against“ based on overall merits and
                                            demerits of the proposed resolution. IAMI will generally support and vote “for“
                                            proposals which are likely to result in maximizing long-term investment returns
                                            for unit holders. IAMI would not support and vote “against“ proposals
                                            that appear to be detrimental to the company financials / interest of the minority
                                            shareholders, which would adversely impact shareholders value.
IAMI may authorize either its own executives/authorized representative to attend
                                            the AGM/EGM to exercise the voting rights or may instruct the Custodian to exercise
                                            voting rights in accordance with the instructions of IAMI. Proof of such authorization
                                            will be maintained by the Deutsche Bank.
Record of matters on which voting rights were exercised will be maintained by Deutsche
                                            Bank and will be subject to internal audit.
Requisite disclosure will be placed before the Board of Religare Invesco AMC and
                                            Religare Invesco Trustee Company on a quarterly basis or such other frequency as
                                            the VC may consider appropriate.
Report on actual exercise of voting rights will be placed on the website of the
                                            Fund (www.invescomutualfund.com)
                                            and also in the annual report sent to the unit holders on an annual basis.

The information on for site is for Professional Clients only. The information on this 
							Web site is not for consumer use.

The information contained herein does not constitute an offer of or 
							   	invitation to apply for our services in any jurisdiction in which 
								such offer or invitation is not authorised. The information herein 
								should be read in conjunction with the Full Prospectus and Key 
								Investor Information Documents for Short-Term Investments Company
								(Global Series) plc ("STIC Global") which can be obtained from 
								Invesco Global Liquidity which is a division of Invesco Asset 
								Management Limited ("IAML") in the UK, a part of Invesco Ltd.
The information on this Web site has been prepared solely for 
								information purposes and is not an offer to buy or sell or a 
								solicitation of an offer to buy or sell the Funds to any person
								in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is 
								not authorised or to any person to whom it would be unlawful to
								market such an offer or solicitation. It is not intended to 
								provide specific investment advice including, without limitation,
								investment, financial, legal, accounting or tax advice, or to 
								make any recommendations about the suitability of the Funds for
								the circumstances of any particular investor. Investors should
							    read the relevant prospectus for details, including the 
							    risk factors and product features. Neither Invesco nor any 
								affiliate of Invesco Limited guarantee the return of capital,
								distribution of income or the performance of the Funds. 
								Asset management services are provided by Invesco in 
								accordance with appropriate local legislation and regulations.
Investors should note placing an investment in the Funds is 
								not the same as placing funds on deposit with a bank or 
								deposit-taking company and redemptions will take place at 
								the Net Asset Value per share. The value of any investments 
								and income from the Funds will fluctuate (for investors 
								investing from a currency other than the currency of the 
								respective Fund, this may partly be the result of exchange 
								rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full 
								amount invested. Past performance and any reference to a 
								ranking or rating, provides no guarantee for future performance 
								results and is not constant over time. As with all investments, 
								there are associated inherent risks. Where Invesco has expressed 
								views and opinions, these may change. While great care has been 
								taken to ensure that the information contained herein is 
								accurate, no responsibility can be accepted for any errors, 
								mistakes or omissions or for any action taken in reliance thereon. 
								The distribution and the offer of these Funds in certain 
								jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into whose 
								possession of information contained on this Web site may come are 
								required to inform themselves about and to comply with any relevant 
								restrictions. Persons interested in investing in the Funds should 
								inform themselves as to (i) the legal requirements in the countries 
								of their nationality, residence, ordinary residence or domicile; 
								(ii) any foreign exchange controls and (iii) any relevant tax 
								consequences. The Funds are not registered under any US securities 
								law, and may not be offered or sold in the USA, its territories or 
								possessions, nor to any US persons. There are some important 
								differences when referring to money market funds on a global platform. 
								In the European Union there are guidelines (set out by the European 
								Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)) defining two categories of 
								money market funds. Short-Term Money Market Funds which encompass 
								Stable Net Asset Value funds with a maximum average maturity of 60 
								days; and Money Market Funds which can have a variable net asset 
								alue and invest in slightly longer dated instruments. Invesco 
								Global Liquidity's money market funds referred to in this document 
								are defined as Short-Term Money Market Funds. In the US, Invesco 
								Global Liquidity also has funds managed on the same basis. The 
								funds are not offered for sale in any jurisdiction in which the 
								funds are not authorized to be publicly sold. The funds are 
								available only in jurisdiction where their promotion and sale is 
								permitted.

Scale your support without burning holes in your pocket
The next time you need a couple of extra hands on high-traffic support days or before any D-day, simply use day passes by Freshservice to temporarily add extra agents whenever you need them. You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
