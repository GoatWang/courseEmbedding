Security

Lake Sunapee Bank, a division of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust, understands that the security of your personal and account information is important to you. We also understand that our continued success as a financial institution relies on both our ability to offer banking services to you in a secure manner as well as your responsibility in keeping any access codes, passwords or PINs secure. To assist us in offering these web-based banking services in a secure manner, we employ a number of measures, which are described below. These measures allow us, among other benefits, to properly authenticate your identity when you access these services and protect your information as it traverses the Internet between your PC and the bank.For more information on how you can be proactive in protecting yourself online, view our Online Banking Security Best Practices. You may also visit our Fraud Prevention page.Log-In protectionYou must privately maintain a combination of a Log-In ID and password. A password will be assigned to you for your first-time login. Upon that first login, you will be required to change to an absolutely private password. If your new password is lost or forgotten, contact our Customer Service Center at 800-281-5772 Monday – Friday from 7:30 am – 5:30 pm and Saturday 8:00 am – 12:00 pm to reset a default password once the bank has confirmed your identity.You must safeguard your Online Banking Login ID and password by keeping them private and secure. Memorization is preferable, as any written password is vulnerable to theft. To reduce the likelihood of password guessing, you will be locked out from the Online Banking system after three (3) unsuccessful login attempts.At that time, you can use the Self-Reset function (if activated), and be prompted to reset the password after answering personally set security questions. You can also call our Customer Service Center at 800-281-5772 Monday – Friday from 7:30 am – 5:30 pm and Saturday 8:00 am – 12:00 pm for assistance.Lake Sunapee Bank utilizes multi-factor authentication when customers login to their accounts. Multi-factor authentication is a method of verifying identity through a combination of secret or unique identifiers linked to a specific customer (such as passwords and other means).To further protect you, a timeout feature is used. This feature will automatically log you out of your current financial service session after a 10-minute period of inactivity. You are responsible for preventing unauthorized viewing of or access to your computer during your online session.Browser SecurityLake Sunapee Bank, a division of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust, also requires the use of secure browsers to protect you while you access our online financial services. More specifically, the personal and account information that flows back and forth between your PC and Lake Sunapee Bank must be encrypted while in transit – secure browsers are how we achieve this level of protection. Encryption is the process of scrambling information (typically for data transmission) so that it can only be reassembled in its original clear text format by someone who has the correct encryption key to do so. When used between you and Lake Sunapee Bank, this technology encrypts your personal information as you send it to us, which only Lake Sunapee Bank can decrypt. Likewise, when we send personal or account information to you, this technology encrypts it, which only you can decrypt. This is possible through a certified 128 bit secure server by VeriSign so that no unauthorized individuals can read or decipher the data.Our online banking service provider continually updates their list of recommended browsers. You can view the list here. Our server does not connect directly to the InternetIt is isolated from the network via “firewall.” All requests to the server are filtered through a router and firewall before they are permitted access to the server. A router is a piece of hardware that works in conjunction with the firewall, a piece of software, to block any direct traffic coming to the server. The router and software “firewall” define and limit access that “outside” computers have to the bank server. The configuration begins by disallowing ALL traffic and then opens only when necessary to process acceptable data requests, such as sending customer requests.

Approved by shareholders in October, 2016, Bar Harbor's acquisition of Lake Sunapee grows the company to over $3 billion in assets, making it one of the largest community banks in Northern New England, with 49 branch locations across the three states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.

Lake Sunapee Bank Group (NAS:LSBG)
Graham Number
=GURUF("NAS:LSBG","Graham Number")

$16.46 (As of Sep. 2016)
Graham Number is a figure that measures a stock's fundamental value by taking into account the company's earnings per share and book value per share. The Graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock. According to the theory, any stock price below the Graham number is considered undervalued, and thus worth investing in.
As of today, the stock price of Lake Sunapee Bank Group is $21.94. Lake Sunapee Bank Group's graham number for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 was $16.46. Therefore, Lake Sunapee Bank Group's Price to Graham Number ratio for today is 1.33.
Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation. It is a very conservative way of valuing a stock.

Definition
Graham Number is a concept based on Ben Graham's conservative valuation of companies.
Lake Sunapee Bank Group's Graham Number for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2015 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI))


=sqrt of (22.5*10.061*1.08)


=15.64



Lake Sunapee Bank Group's Graham Number for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI) (TTM))


=sqrt of (22.5*10.847*1.11)


=16.46



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Explanation
Ben Graham actually did not publish a formula like this. But he wrote in The Intelligent Investor (1948 version) regarding to the criteria for purchases:
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
Unlike valuation methods such as DCF or Discounted Earnings, the Graham number does not take growth into the valuation. Unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone, it takes into account the earnings power. Therefore, the Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation.
In general, the Graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock. It cannot be applied to companies with negative book values. 
Lake Sunapee Bank Group's Price to Graham number Ratio for today is calculated as



Price to Graham number=Share Price (Today)/Graham number (Q: Sep. 2016 )


=21.94/16.46


=1.33



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Please keep these in mind:
1. Graham Number does not take growth into account. Therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth. We feel that if the earnings per share grows more than 10% a year, Graham Number underestimates the value.
2. Graham Number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings. Therefore, an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of Graham Number.
3. Graham Numbers underestimates companies that are light with book.
