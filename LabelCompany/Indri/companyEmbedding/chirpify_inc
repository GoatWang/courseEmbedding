The Liability & ROI of Rewarding Engagement






Accounting for loyalty program points can present a challenge to organizations looking for ways to modernize their program by expanding beyond “spend and get” to reward for engagement. After all, the argument goes, points are a liability and creating more of them can’t be done lightly. This perspective will not only keep you from much needed transformation, but will also keep your program from reaching its true potential. To understand why, let’s take a look at the logic behind loyalty programs in the first place, how marketers get trapped in accounting-related exercises, and last, how we can collectively break free to modernize our programs for a truly customer-centric rewards experience.
Discount vs. Loyalty Program
Prior to loyalty programs, companies would offer a discount to encourage sales. Discounts are customer neutral, meaning that anyone can redeem them — whether they are a new or existing customer. Intuitively, some customers are worth more to the business than others. However, discounts do not differentiate and are just as easily redeemed by loyal customers as they are by deal seekers.
Now, if an organization applied the same discount via accrued points to loyalty program customers, not only would they ensure a repeat sale, but they would create goodwill and build value in the relationship. The dollars are guaranteed to come back to the business when points are redeemed and even then, not all points will be used.
Accrued Points
The downside to this approach is that is has created a phenomenon of certain customers who like to bank their points for a future big purchase. The impact of this is two-fold if you are a business that tracks the value of your loyalty points in financial statements. First, points are a liability in the accounting sense which makes loyalty marketers concerned about creating too much liability for the organization. And, second, as most organizations’ loyalty programs revolve around a spend-and-get approach, there is a defined equation between revenue generated by loyalty program members and the liability they are able to create through their activity.
It is important to note here that while some organizations don’t track rewards on their financials at all, others have created their own guidelines for doing so as there remains no standard accounting method for tracking and reporting on program-created rewards.
The Flip Side
While loyalty marketers have become sensitive to the balance between revenue and reward, introducing new methodologies to this equation can be seen as challenging, or at worst, a threat. However, a fixation on the spend/liability equation ignores the flip side of the coin — the impact loyal customers have to business operations. To maximize the impact of a loyalty program, marketers should consider how they can maximize the value of customers to their business, further boosting the topline.
More to the point, customers are maturing and demanding more from brand relationships. Consider that according to research by Accenture, 51% of U.S. consumers are loyal to brands that interact with them through their preferred channels of communication. Increasingly, that channel of choice is mobile and social. Indeed, as reported by comScore, one of every five minutes of digital media time is spent with social media. Of this, roughly 80 percent is spent on mobile. Given all this, it’s clear that there is a large opportunity to use social media as a mechanism to turn the smartphone into a key component of your loyalty program.
Engagement Loyalty Drives ROI
Bringing it all together, engaging customers in these new channels–enabling them to earn rewards for their brand advocacy–allows loyalty marketers to modernize their programs and focus on the operational, topline value loyal customers bring to the business. By taking a social engagement approach to loyalty marketing, with an emphasis on providing utility and a fair value exchange, brands are able to drive social actions that not only engage customers but also create social proof, earned media, and word-of-mouth that simultaneously serves to grow new customer acquisition.
Moreover, research from brands that have added social media components to their loyalty programs have found that socially connected members buy twice as frequently as non-connected members. And one hotelier with such a program found that its connected members, in a given year, spent 75% more than the average member. They also had 2X more purchases than the average member in the same time period. Companies that track engagement loyalty find that the ROI is just as attributable as with “spend and get” programs.
Independent ROI Studies
Independent ROI studies conducted by our enterprise retail and hotel customers found that their socially connected loyalty members (connected via Chirpify) had the following data points vs non-connected members. To find out more, download the ROI study.



Retail
 Have a higher NPS score (79% vs 73%)
 Have a higher trust in the brand (65% vs 60%)
 Spend more with the brand (35% vs 22%)
 Mark the brand as #1 in preference vs competitors (62% vs 57%)




Hospitality
 Spend 75% more
 2X more bookings in the same time period



Leave Liability Behind
Traditionally, brands have approached the loyalty equation with points, but research featured in the International Journal of Hospitality Management found that “providing social rewards [e.g., a member-exclusive personal lounge, health club, concierge services, and invitations to special events] increases customers’ emotional attachment and effective commitment to a company, and hence they are more likely to behave in ways that are beneficial to it.” This insight is important as brands look to create a value exchange that converts in social media.
Successful ideas for creating value in exchange for social participation and loyalty include invitations to social VIP only events, free upgrades or sneak peeks, unique or exclusive content, and the opportunity to engage with a brand celebrity — none of which result in liabilities you need to report to finance. For example, a leading sports retailer found that its members who were socially engaged spent on average $40 more per year. Multiply that by total connected members and it’s easy to see how the old accounting of points and liability must be modernized to reflect the new math of social engagement ROI.
At the end of the day, customers want to engage and interact with their favorite brands — and they want to be rewarded for it as they recognize the value of their time and their voice. Simultaneously, customers at organizations who have connected social media to their loyalty program are more engaged, participate and spend more with the brand, positively impacting the topline.Share if you care:TwitterFacebookLinkedInPocketEmail 





Chirpify Helps Soccer.com Score Big with Goal Club Rewards






Sports Endeavors Incorporated (SEI), the company behind popular sports brands such as Soccer.com, Lacrosse.com, and WorldRugbyShop.com, thinks of its employees, its community and its customers as a team. To that end, we’re teaming with SEI and soccer clubs across the country to not only outfit teams for the season, but reward them with a free 12-month Goal Club Membership.
When soccer club athletes receive their team uniform this summer, it will be accompanied by a uniform care guide and a free membership to Soccer.com’s rewarding membership program, Goal Club. Additionally, now through December 31, 2017, members sharing a photo of their new team jersey on Twitter or Instagram using #soccerdotcomteam will score 100 Goal Club points for registration and 50 Goal Club points for sharing the photo. Accumulated points can be redeemed for coupon codes good for dollars off the next order. 

SEI engages customers with our engagement loyalty platform that listens in the background for social triggers — in this instance the hashtag #soccerdotcomteam — and rewards customers for the action automatically and immediately.
Avid soccer players and fans are already posting fun and exciting pictures on social channels; SEI is simply acknowledging and thanking them for their advocacy when the pictures are of team uniforms bought through Soccer.com. At this point, it’s game on; customers are recognized for their advocacy, positive social publicity ensues, and a virtuous circle is created. (Read here further background on how Soccer.com worked with us to expand its Goal Club program to embrace its loyal fans on social and messaging channels.)
While this particular campaign runs for a limited time, coincident with summer uniforms, it is part of the larger, ongoing SEI loyalty program designed to enhance customer loyalty by actively engaging people in their social channel of choice. Once the member’s Goal Club email account is linked with their Twitter and/or Instagram social accounts, SEI can use its CRM to seamlessly gather valuable social data to both analyze and fine-tune marketing efforts. 

Thanks to our reporting tools, SEI can measure and calculate ROI on a variety of matrices. For example, they can assess which social channels are most frequented by their customers and sports communities; they can compare this campaign to previous campaigns to see what worked; and they can even quantify and pinpoint trends by moderating social conversations to address any customer support issues or glean ideas for improving products. Most importantly, though, the data can help SEI better understand how to effectively communicate with customers to build and strengthen team relationships.

The Chirpify engagement loyalty platform creates a win-win situation, rewarding loyal customers and providing valuable data to businesses, all while increasing customer loyalty, advocacy, and spend. Our customer research has proven that people are loyal to smart companies like Sports Endeavors that engage them in the moment. This loyalty generates brand advocacy that brings new customers to the game. The cycle repeats, positivity grows, and so does revenue.

Twitter Bots & Brands – Fraud Wars







There has been a lot of talk over the years about bots on Twitter. Since we invented instant transactions from a single social media action, with Chirpify itself being a bot on Twitter since 2011, I thought I’d share some thoughts on Twitter bots and brand campaigns. Today there are a LOT of bots on Twitter, and as this recent Adage article points out, brands are worried about it, and concerned about automation in general. Since automation of social media marketing is inevitable, as it was with email and other marketing channels, brands need to get comfortable with this fact.
As the article points out, marketers have seen their campaign metrics be skewed by bot accounts engaging with their campaigns.

 The advertiser had asked Twitter if any of the activity was from bots, which Twitter denied. So the agency decided to scrutinize the campaign itself. It turned out that between 10% and 20% of Twitter activity on that particular campaign came from bots, according to the agency executive. 

10% – 20% is a lot of “fake news” to handle as a marketer. It is especially frustrating when Twitter itself has provided no tools for marketers to avoid this. Since we’ve literally been a currency conversion between Twitter and financial and loyalty programs for 5 years, we’ve been forced to build tools specifically designed to avoid fraudulent bot activity. Our brand’s campaigns literally ignore bot accounts like they don’t even exist, not responding to or enabling them to transact or earn points, enter contests, get content, promo codes, or any other marketing outcome enabled by the platform. They do this utilizing the following features:
Automatic Bot Detection
Our rules engine can govern campaign engagement by several criteria, including geo-fencing, influence, and frequency. Using the influence filter brands can specify how many followers an account needs to participate in their campaign. They can also specify that their campaign ignore other bot identifiers like “eggheads” (accounts without profile photos), or accounts that have not tweeted much, or accounts that do not match other custom campaign or user criteria set by the brand.
Member Verification
Since Chirpify is integrated with membership databases, our platform can lookup customer details based on their social identity. So, if a brand doesn’t want any non-members to participate in a campaign, they can block them.
Frequency Limitations
Our rules engine can also limit participation in campaigns based on frequency, for example limiting contest entries to one Twitter account, or making accounts perform multiple actions to be rewarded, single use promo codes, and more.
Targeting
Brand campaigns often involve a call-to-action, instructing people to set off a social action like sharing a photo to be rewarded. When they do, our platform performs marketing automation, rules checking, automated smart responses and rewards. However, more brands are starting using our platform to mine social data for topics to surprise and delight consumers with a DM containing a reward or content. In this case, our dashboard enables brands to aggregate all posts and accounts containing the topic, and review all posts for quality before responding and rewarding. This gives marketers manual human control, while still saving them a lot of time by having responses and rewards preloaded into the system.
Blacklisting
If a bot account does pass the rules engine qualifiers brands have a fall-back – They can universally blacklist accounts, preventing them from participating in any future campaigns.
Conclusion
Enterprise brands have run millions of transactions through our platform, making our engine smarter along the way, eliminating fraud and bot activity. Our analytics dashboard provides the data metrics for brands to realize and confirm their campaign participant authenticity.
If you’re a brand concerned about false campaign activity from bots, you should consider utilizing tools built for the exact purpose of avoiding it. Contact us today to learn more.Share if you care:TwitterFacebookLinkedInPocketEmail 





Announcing Chirpify Social Loyalty CRM






“Know your audience.” It’s a simple and obvious mantra for any successful business. What’s not so simple and obvious is exactly how to go about getting to know your customers, connecting their identities in social media and messaging to existing customer records. Even further, if that data is obtained, most brands don’t know what to do with it.  Full Press Release  Request a Dashboard Demo
Today we’re excited to announce the ability to link personal social media and chat IDs with loyalty program and CRM databases, as well as a new CRM dashboard, enabling loyalty and social media marketers to segment members, view consumer engagement history, and instantly respond to consumers with content and rewards. With this connection, once obscure and anonymous social people become meaningful, identifiable customers that can be understood individually and in aggregate. Marketers can now discreetly mine customer information across social media and messaging to improve future marketing campaigns and calculate ROI.
tldr;
Here’s a quick list of some of what it enables brands to do…


Connect social identity to existing customer records seamlessly
Aggregate all consumer posts (members and non-members alike) across all campaigns and social channels based on listening triggers you specify
Segment and view posts by multiple criteria
See all consumer profiles (members and non-members alike)
Segment and view users by multiple criteria
View consumer engagement and campaign history
Instantly reward consumers selecting different rewards from rewards library
Instantly message consumers back over same social channel they posted on
Create a message library for easy selection
View campaign analytics in real-time or over time
View consumer and posts while selecting multiple campaigns

Connecting the Data
Brands are connecting social media and chat identity to their existing customer records, and they’re doing it natively, without complex click tracking or convoluted customer experiences. They’re doing it by incentivizing their customers to connect their social media accounts as part of their loyalty program or marketing campaign. When this connection is made, the consumer obtains a remote control for marketing conversion and rewards, and the brand is able to listen, respond, and engage the consumer across multiple channels, all while gathering valuable CRM data. Through our social loyalty CRM all of your member’s engagement posts are aggregated, and their engagement history is viewable right in the dashboard. Furthermore, the entire platform is integrated with your existing CRM and Loyalty databases, so pushing and pulling data between the two is seamless.



Chirpify mobile app and crm integration for Silver Diner

The engine that powers the Chirpify platform allows you to link social IDs to your rewards/loyalty database and to your CRM software. Once obscure and anonymous social people are now meaningful, identifiable customers that can be understood individually and in aggregate, and responded to automatically or with moderation.


The new Chirpify dashboard provides easier, quicker access to unique data already available within our engagement loyalty platform, as well as your own loyalty and crm databases. The dashboard gives brands an easy way to segment audiences based on campaign, user, geolocation, influence, photos, posts, and more. Once segmented, marketers can choose who to engage, and what to engage them with, whether it’s a contest entry, points delivery, utility response, or other marketing outcomes. In other words, we not only supply you with the data, we give you the tools to do something meaningful with it.

Reporting & ROI
Taking data analysis to the next level, the data collected can then be used to determine ROI. In fact, several Chirpify customers have already used this data to determine that their socially connected loyalty members spend significantly more than those that are not connected via the Chirpify platform. One retailer told us that they learned from data analytics that connected members buy twice as frequently as non-connected members. And, a hotelier told us, “With analysis we have found that connected members, in a given year, spent 75% more than the average member. They also had 2X more purchases than the average member in the same time period.” View independ

Twitter DM Cards and Chirpify – Pushing Chatbots to Meaningful Conversation






Last week Twitter announced a new Direct Message Card for advertisers. The card allows brands to create ads with up to four different prompts that can be used to kick-start conversations on a specific topic, with the goal of helping brands start a private chat with customers. Having developed chatbots since 2011, we are excited to see Twitter’s continued investment in making chatbots more accessible to marketers and customers alike.
If you aren’t already familiar with the new Twitter Direct Message Cards, they are specially designed ads that prompt people to select a given reply from a menu of choices within the ad. From this response, a personal conversation will begin in Twitter’s Direct Message tab. In the case of the Patron Tequila ad below, a person selecting one of these four responses will engage a bot in a Direct Message conversation with the bot suggesting cocktails based on their menu choice.
The new DM Card, according to Twitter, will help businesses drive discovery both through promoted tweets and organic sharing. 
Discovery
Which brings me to my first point about the evolution of chatbots. While Twitter’s DM Card seeks to address one area that chatbots have traditionally struggled —  Discovery — Chirpify has long had a solution to this issue. Specifically, we’ve been driving chatbot discovery and engagement through the use of social triggers that can be used in any medium – from TV advertising to billboards; megatrons to email – that causes an immediate conversion opportunity from offline marketing to brand chatbots. While the Twitter DM Card helps elevate chatbots within the Twitter environment, Chirpify can elevate chatbots across marketing channels, in the process growing customer awareness, engagement and conversion. And, once people have converted with Chirpify, future conversion is seamless; people can stay in the Twitter (or other social media/messaging) context in which they are already operating.

Loyalty Drives Engagement
MarketingLand compares the new Twitter DM Card to Moviefone in which users “dial 1 for…” and the bot responds with content based on that topic. While this approach may engage people who are intrigued by the multi-choice ad, it will be important to create content that is viewed as a true value exchange for participation. A proven way to do this is to connect the person’s social ID to the loyalty program or CRM database to gain a deeper understanding of who the person is your chatbot is interacting with and use that data to further personalize your content and/or offers.
Connecting your chatbot and loyalty program is an ideal approach for two important reasons:

It allows you to identify customers individually and in aggregate
Provides you the opportunity to offer customers loyalty program points or other valued rewards in exchange for their participation.

This value exchange is critical to chatbot adoption and long-term success and in the process also provides brands with significant data that informs the ROI of their chatbot efforts.


Chirpify Marketing Chatbots
The Chirpify engine provides leading brands like Marriott, La Quinta, and Columbia Sportswear with chatbot abilities to engage and convert customers and calculate ROI of social media and messaging efforts. Critically, these organizations have linked the Chirpify engine to their loyalty programs, driving greater:

Engagement and participation
Rates of conversion
Loyalty
Spend per visit
Frequency of spend

Increasing Spend – ROI
Indeed, Chirpify’s retail customers have found that people who connect their social ID and loyalty program account buy twice as frequently as non-connected members. And Chirpify’s hotel customers found that connected members spent 75% more than the average member in a given year. They also had 2X more purchases than the average member in the same time period.
The ChirpBot has been growing in sophistication for years now, with complex rules based logic, such as geo-fencing, frequency of participation, moderation, and responding to people in their native tongue.

Announcing Chirpify Mobile App Integration






Read full press release here
For years we’ve helped customers increase their customer’s loyalty and spend by rewarding consumers for their engagement with the brand in social media and messaging applications. And now, we are excited to announce that we are further streamlining and strengthening the customer-brand relationship with the ability to integrate our engagement loyalty platform directly into any brand’s mobile app for the customer’s ease of access and conversion.

Integrated Social Login & Engagement Loyalty Opt-In
While the process of linking social accounts to a rewards program has always been easy with Chirpify, it’s become even easier as customers can now instantly and seamlessly register their social accounts within your mobile app. This allows customers to immediately begin earning loyalty program rewards for their social and chat engagement(s). For your customers, this integration brings greater utility, making it even easier for them to participate and do business with you. And, the integration provides the ability to engage more deeply with customers on the mobile app, which is important as mobile users have been proven to spend more per transaction.
By embedding social logins in your mobile app, consumers can link their social account(s) of choice–whether that be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram–to your reward program without ever exiting the brand’s app. Keeping customers in the context they are in is important to holding their attention and having them finish a desired action; integration with your mobile app is yet another way Chirpify helps ensure this action is completed and the long-term benefits of engagement loyalty are achieved.  
Engagement & Rewards
Once linked, Chirpify enables brands to listen for specific conversations and social media actions, such as topics, hashtags, photo uploads, sharing links and more. Brands can also define rules such as geo-fencing, frequency, and influence, automatically responding to consumers whose posts meet the listening and rules criteria. Members earn rewards for every eligible social action.

 Silver Diner has developed award-winning fresh and local menus to address today’s lifestyles. To stay relevant and participating in our customers’ lifestyle, we know we need to engage our diners between meals on social media. With Chirpify, Silver Diner gains new customers and valuable customer data, and diners accrue rewards for dollars off their next visit. This virtuous cycle of rewards, earned media, new customer acquisition, and customer-driven data underscores our philosophy of “Eat Well, Do Well”. 
Joe Howell, Senior Marketing Manager, Silver Diner

CRM
In addition to the greater engagement, retention, loyalty and spend that engagement loyalty brings to brands, this integration also serves to boost the power of your CRM. By making it easier to link and match your customer’s social identity to an existing account and/or customer record, Chirpify feeds the CRM with important social and messaging data that strengthens the CRM’s segmentation and retargeting power.

Chirpify and goPuff Offer Customers Convenience without the Store






 
We’re excited that goPuff, the mobile convenience store delivery service, has teamed up with us to bring more convenience to more people.


 In cities across America, goPuff’s mission is to connect through convenience. Chirpify’s engagement loyalty platform helps fulfill that mission by connecting goPuff customers more deeply with the brand on social media. 
Taylor Goldman, Head of Content, goPuff

In today’s world, convenience and utility are top priorities and goPuff delivers on these expectations, literally. With a few mouse clicks – or swipes on a smartphone – customers get what they want when they want it. Offering 30 minute delivery of thousands of convenience goods, goPuff currently operates in 18 cities across the US (or more cities if the consumer can wait 1-2 business days for delivery) and is growing every month. It’s a convenience store on wheels, so customers can save time without interrupting their current activity of choice.

Delivering Utility
Chirpify delivers utility to goPuff customers. Today’s consumers have a remote control in their pocket that allows them to interact with brands how, when and where they like.

Connecting Social to Loyalty & CRM
Chirpify and goPuff extend this utility to customers, connecting them in mobile and social. By connecting their social account(s) to goPuff, customers can seamlessly earn rewards for their social actions — such as participating in goPuff campaigns, sharing user generated content and more. In the background Chirpify listens for these social triggers and automatically responds to goPuff customers at scale with randomly generated goPuff voucher codes for things like free delivery and dollars-off of future orders. In exchange, goPuff receives earned media which helps fuel customer loyalty and new customer acquisition, as well as valuable data, overlaying social identity to their existing customer records.

This is just one example of how Chirpify’s engagement loyalty platform is rewarding customers and increasing spend. Consumers spend enormous amounts of time online in social media, and research has proven that they are loyal to brands like goPuff that save them time and engage them in the moment with random acts of kindness. This loyalty generates brand advocacy, which reaps new customers. The cycle repeats, positivity grows, and so does revenue.

Our Take: Facebook Expands Messenger Platform






At last year’s F8 Facebook Developer Conference, Facebook opened its API to developers for building bots on its Messenger Platform. Since we’ve been building chatbots since 2011, we were quite excited at the time by the potential this news provided, believing that the familiar interface of social media messaging is the right channel for real-time human language chatbots. Both trusted by — and comfortable to — users, social media messaging offers incredible upside to brands wishing to engage deeper with their customers while providing personalization and utility.
Fast forward to this year’s F8 conference and Facebook has again made news with its Messenger Platform.  This time around, Facebook has announced bot discovery through the addition of a Discovery tab and Messenger codes. While we argued last year that discovery is undoubtedly a large challenge to conversational conversion, such as that facilitated by chatbots, the Facebook additions are a helpful half-step forward. However, to reap the benefits of chatbots and encourage customer engagement, brands need three things.
More Discovery
Facebook’s yellow pages will be helpful for reactive discovery of bots. For example, if I am looking for pizza delivery, I might search for a bot to help me with that. However, for proactive bot discovery, yellow pages aren’t ideal. (How many times have you proactively let your fingers do the walking? I’m guessing not often.)  Similarly, brands who want to proactively promote their Messenger-based chat bots need to find a way to proactively drive engagement. At Chirpify, we’ve been fueling this very kind of discovery and engagement through the use of social triggers that can be used in any medium – from TV advertising to billboards; megatrons to email – that causes an immediate conversion opportunity from offline marketing to brand chatbots.
And while Facebook has launched Messenger codes which reflects this notion, they are limited to images that can be snapped with a cell phone camera. Another limitation is that they do not connect the dots as to which customer activated the code, which brings me to my second point.
Recognize your Customers
In addition to driving discovery, it is important that brands use the chatbot opportunity for greater recognition, acknowledgement and personalization. Simultaneously, it is increasingly important for brands to show the ROI of their social media efforts. To achieve both, you need to integrate your Messenger chatbot with the corporate CRM or customer database. Doing so allows you to recognize your customers when they engage with your chatbot. And, you can create offers tailored to them; reward them for taking certain actions; or personally acknowledge them for their participation. In addition, when you tie these systems together, you are able to provide closed-loop analytics, learning for example which customers engage with your chatbot, and how, when and why they use it. This deeper data set on your social media customers allows you to further hone your marketing efforts for greater efficacy.
Utility
When brought all together, these strategies allow you to create and drive utility for customers. More than convenience, utility means making it truly easy to do business with you by making your customer known to you across your customer touch points and simplifying the interaction process. Said another way, customers want a bot to be tied to their overall brand experience and provide utility by already knowing who they are and making it incredibly easy to take the next step in participating or interacting with you. Of course, this data can be easily obtained through the customer database and when linked to your customer’s Facebook ID, provides a closed-loop look at your customer.
For brands to be successful engaging consumers with chatbots, they will need to connect the interface to meaningful experiences, back end business processes, and consumer programs that already exist within the organization. Loyalty programs are an ideal example as they are designed for utility, are supported by a deep customer database, and are home to your most loyal customers. With a Messenger-based chatbot, your program members can engage more deeply as it provides a platform for your most loyal customers to interact with the brand in ways that are meaningful to them and encourages a symbiotic relationship with points and/or other rewards in exchange for participation.

Silver Diner Launches Engagement Rewards Program With Chirpify






 
We’re excited to team up with Silver Diner, an American restaurant with 14 locations in Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey, to bring its “Eat Well, Do Well Rewards Club” to social media. Our platform is moving the program beyond just rewarding for spend to recognizing and rewarding members for their participation and engagement in social media.


 Silver Diner has developed award-winning fresh and local menus to address today’s lifestyles. To stay relevant and participating in our customers’ lifestyle, we know we need to engage our diners between meals on social media. With Chirpify, Silver Diner gains new customers and valuable customer data, and diners accrue rewards for dollars off their next visit. This virtuous cycle of rewards, earned media, new customer acquisition, and customer-driven data underscores our philosophy of “Eat Well, Do Well”. 
Joe Howell, Senior Marketing Manager, Silver Diner

In addition to its nostalgic tabletop jukeboxes, comfortable booths, and classic American food with a healthy twist, warm and friendly people are at the heart of Silver Diner. True to this warm and friendly reputation, Silver Diner has a history of giving back to both the community and its customers through a traditional rewards program. For example, schools earn a percentage back from linked customer sales, and customers earn points towards dollars that are redeemable on future visits to the restaurant. Now Silver Diner wants to make it even easier for customers to earn rewards.
For every eligible social action on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, Silver Diner customers are rewarded with points. Customers can earn up to five points each month, which translates into $5 off the member’s next visit. Our platform listens for specific social actions, as defined by Silver Diner, and applies rules from its rules engine, automatically sending a response to the customer behind the social action.
Integrated

In addition to fueling listening, rules and responses, our solution is integrated with Paytronix, which tracks members’ earned points and redeemed rewards in a digital wallet. This means that when a customer checks their loyalty account, the social media points are visible and accounted for.
To fuel more participation, Silver Diner also integrated our offsite social registration into their mobile app, so members can instantly connect their social accounts to begin earning rewards.
As current customers share their experiences, new customers are garnered, and the business’s top line is positively impacted. The positive cycle of customer engagement, conversion, loyalty and new customer acquisition is proven to drive positive ROI. The bonus for companies actively engaging their customers? Rich customer data that can be used for future promotions and campaigns to repeat the cycle.

Hi, we’re Chirpify


Here’s what we do…
We enable enterprise brands to connect social and chat to loyalty and CRM, to engage and reward consumers across all channels for brand advocacy, not just spend.
Here’s what we believe…
The future of marketing is providing utility to consumers. Right now your customers are measuring your brand based on just how much utility you provide. It is no longer wise, nor effective, to simply spray and pray advertising to consumers. With ever decreasing time and attention spans, consumers will be loyal to those brands that save them time, engage in the moment, and make doing business with them easier across all channels. We’ve built solutions specifically designed to provide more utility. We’d like you to use them.

Follow us on   


Careers
Located in downtown Portland, we have a beautiful office with views of Mt. Hood. We’re dog friendly, provide flexible unmetered vacation time, provide 100% medical coverage for you and your family, a competitive 401k plan, and have all the usual startup amenities like a stocked kitchen and cold keg on tap. We’d love to have you on our team.

		Patent applications show the company's intellectual property, as well as its current capabilities and future direction.
		Chirpify has applied for 1 patents since 2009. 

Chirpify's most recent patent was filed on 05/15/2014 for System And Methods For Processing In-stream Transactions On Micro-blogs And Other Social Networks. System and methods for processing in-stream transactions on micro-blogs and other social networks (â€œin-stream transaction processing systemâ€) facilitates transactions via comments, posts or messages on social networks. The in-stream transaction processing system converts social channels used for conversation into channels through which users can engage in commerce, fundraising or other non-financial activities. In an embodiment, the in-stream transaction processing system monitors user messages on a social network to determine whether a user message includes an action command and a campaign identifier. The in-stream transaction processing system identifies the user message having the action command and the campaign identifier as a request to process a transaction and processes the transaction accordingly. Since the users do not have to use shopping carts and checkouts, the in-stream transaction processing system provides a simple and frictionless method of conducting online transactions.

Recession Risk
	IncFact analyzed data from the last recession to determine whether Chirpify grew or shrank over that period. We also looked at other companies in the industry
	 to compare how recession-proof Chirpify is relative to the industry. While a new recession may strike a particular industry, measuring the
	 industry and company's robustness during the last recession estimates its ability to weather future recessions.

	
Market Share of Competition: Chirpify vs. Largest Competitors
		A competitive analysis shows these companies are in the same general field as Chirpify, even though they may not compete head-to-head. 
		These are the largest companies by revenue. However, they may not have the largest market share in this industry if they have diversified into other business lines. 
		The "Competition" section of a business plan or investment memorandum would start by analyzing the information about these companies.

Chirpify Drops Its “Hashtag Commerce” Consumer Marketplace To Focus On Big Brand Marketing And “Actiontags”

According to Chirpify founder Chris Teso, “hashtags are the new URL.” Though more than a few people at Twitter are no doubt nodding their head vigorously in agreement, everywhere you turn in the tech industry, someone is creating (or has a patent pending on) “the new, new version of X.” So does Teso’s declaration actually ring true? For starters, some context: Chirpify launched in early 2012 to do something about the fact that social commerce — despite its billing as “the next big thing” in eCommerce — has thus far failed to live up to the hype.
In an effort to make social commerce as easy as possible for Average Joes, Chirpify initially let anyone buy or sell products in-stream on Twitter instantly, using keywords and hashtags like “buy” or “gimme”. Fast forward to the present, and Chirpify has abandoned its P2P, consumer-facing “hashtag commerce” marketplace and is going full-on B2B — and enterprise, to boot.
Like social commerce itself, Chirpify’s P2P social payment marketplace didn’t see the dizzying adoption it hoped for, so the startup has quietly shifted its focus to servicing enterprise players. Today, Chirpify has become a sort of social payment PaaS, helping brands increase conversion across multiple channels, digital and otherwise. In other words, Chirpify is now an enterprise marketing platform — or “conversion platform” to use its lingo.
Given Chirpify’s new focus on advertising and multi-channel marketing for brands, Teso’s claim that hashtags are dethroning URLs starts to make sense. In 1995, he explains, brands used URLs in their advertising as a way to push users to their homepages and towards “conversion.” By 2010, brands had begun directing users to Facebook Brand pages, whereas today, he says, most campaigns now include hashtags, whether it’s an ad on TV, in a magazine or on the Web.
Today, instead of asking users to click on a Facebook page or URL if they want to learn more about a product or, gasp, buy it, Chirpify wants to give brands the ability to let their customers buy direct from Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Though the real question is, of course, whether people will actually follow suit, and if the ability to buy direct from social streams — that supposed ease of access — will increase the likelihood that we’ll buy the product, whatever it is.
From a strategic standpoint, while social commerce has been slow to take off, Teso thinks enabling brands to advertise and offer direct purchasing through social media positions Chirpify at an increasingly active intersection. Especially between TV and digital, thanks to the rise of the second screen (and third and fourth, etc.) experiences and viewing. A recent Nielsen study, for example, claims that one half of smartphone and tablet owners use their devices while watching TV.

Looking backwards, P2P (and B2C) instant in-stream payments was a cool idea for Chirpify to begin with and remains the foundation of its new platform, but in terms of demand (and where people are), you don’t hear much about mom and pop businesses making a billion from selling their hot cakes on Twitter. While Twitter has hired a “Head of Commerce,” transactions on Twitter and Facebook are far from commonplace. The perception of social commerce as an insecure, awkward and clunky transactional process remains.
Thus, Chirpify shifting its focus to brands isn’t a mistake. While tough for the little guys, big brands, celebrities and the like have found plenty of success using Facebook and Twitter as promotional and advertising channels — to reach (and interact with) their “target” audience. That being said, thought Twitter and Facebook serve well as a megaphone, the problem for brands is turning those 10 million Friends and Followers into buyers, and repeat buyers.
That’s why Chirpify is now leveraging its ability to enable instant, in-stream responses and transactions and applying that to brands’ social campaigns, like product launches, flash sales, VIP offers and contests, for example. The startup wants to help brands turn social channels into a more fluid conversion channel using traditional advertising as well, by enabling advertisers and shows to include hashtag actions (like #vote, #buy, etc.) to get users signing up on websites, Facebook pages, interacting with content or making purchases. Or at least that’s the idea.
Chirpify’s newest addition to its marketing arsenal, which launches officially today, is called “#actiontags,” which Teso describes as the “logical evolution of hashtags.” Essentially, as one might expect, actiontags give brands the ability to activate hashtags and turn social media channels into an actual point of conversion, cross-channel-style.
Like the Chirpify of old, these actiontags allow people to make purchases, enter contests, donate, subscribe and so on by posting a hashtag — no, ACTIONtag — on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Thanks to the wizardry of mobile devices and a little thing called the Intertubes, people can do this from anywhere, while watching TV, in a hot tub, on a boat, from the front of a parade or the back of a concert.
Sounds fishy, how does it work exactly, you ask?
Basically, brands define define the #actiontags (#buy, #donate, etc) and the #campaigntag (whatever’s being sold, say, #HotRoombaDecals) and then advertise them, whereupon customers can respond by posting both tags and transact. iRobot could include “post #buy #roombadecals to purchase” at the end of a TV advertisement, for example, and all users need to do is tweet, Facebook or Instagram that and Chirpify processes the order.
In becoming a B2B social conversion service, Chirpify is also offering a bunch of stuff on the back-end of its platform to help businesses collect data on how their users are interacting with their brands on social media — and make smarter decisions accordingly. Plus, campaign strategy, design, planning and all that jazz.
Teso tells us that, since launching in February 2012, Chirpify has seen hundreds of brands and merchants list over 10,000 products on the platform and that it’s currently seeing a 4 percent conversion rate in-stream. Since the beginning of the year — also the point at which the CEO says it made the shift away from consumers — revenue has been doubling month-over-month. It’s allowed the company to “touch bigger budgets,” with the average enterprise client paying Chirpify $25K, he tells us.
Forever 21, MasterCard and NPR’s Live Wire are three of the brands signed up to use Chirpify for cross-channel campaigns out of the gate, and Teso says that the company is in talks with a number of others. With its new direction, Chirpify could have just upped its attractiveness to venues, stadiums, sports teams and promoters — who could use this during live events to hawk merchandise and so on.
From Teso’s vantage point, brands are still hungry for data on how their customers interact with their brands, and their social media channels. Over the long haul, Teso wants Chirpify to help brands find better ways to increase engagement on their social media channels, but the CEO says, at this point, brands are just happy to get a glimpse into that customer intent data.
