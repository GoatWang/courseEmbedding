Shows you everything outside your door, day or night
Vivint Doorbell Camera brings elegant design, understated form, and high-tech function to your entryway. More useful than a doorbell, more subtle than a security camera, with a 180-degree lens, HD resolution, and infrared night vision to see everything outside your door at all hours.











Minimalist design that blends seamlessly into your doorway
An ominous surveillance camera overlooking a welcome mat might send visitors a mixed message. The minimalist design mimics a regular doorbell. It blends seamlessly with your home exterior to keep your entryway feeling like a meeting place instead of a TSA checkpoint.











Two-way talk lets you answer your door from anywhere
With its built-in two-way talk, Vivint Doorbell Camera lets you talk to visitors even when you’re away. That way you can get package deliveries stored someplace safe, not left out in the open. And when a surprise visitor shows up, you can make other arrangements.












Smart alerts that give advance notice of surprise visitors
You can’t predict who might show up unannounced, or when. With a discreet camera built into your doorbell, it won’t matter. Smart motion detection notifies you when someone approaches so you’ll know they’re outside before they ever ring. You’ll know even if they knock.















Smart home controls that extend the reach of your hospitality
With Vivint Doorbell Camera’s integration into the Vivint Smart Home platform, you can talk to visitors, unlock doors, and turn on lights from within a single app. That means you won’t need to leave dinner guests waiting on your doorstep when you get delayed.












Smart motion detection knows what to record and what to ignore
Vivint Doorbell Camera’s visitor detection distinguishes people from passing cars, dancing shadows, or waving branches. Real visitors activate 30-second, Smart Clips recordings that get saved for 45 days to give you time to catch up on what you’ve missed.












Save all the important moments with Vivint Playback
Vivint Playback upgrade adds 24/7 recording to the experience. Recordings upload wirelessly to the Playback storage device, so WiFi networks won't crash. And since it all integrates into one smart home system, you can view recordings from the Vivint mobile app.











Professional Installation with Vivint Smart Home Pros
Qualified and licensed Smart Home Pros handle installation so you can focus on your life. Our installation teams will make sure your doorbell camera blends with your home exterior, links up seamlessly with your Vivint Smart Home system and works the way you want it too.

Where all your home controls come together
No more wandering the house flipping switches and punching keypads before bed. Vivint SkyControl Panel is a smart home hub that bundles all your smart home controls in one place, giving you control of lights, locks, garage doors, thermostats, and security systems from one spot.






A panic button to call for immediate help
If you notice someone prowling your property, SkyControl lets you watch through your security cameras from a safe location. For situations that turn dangerous, SkyControl comes with a  panic button to sound the alarm and open instant communication with security monitoring teams.

If you notice someone prowling your property, SkyControl lets you watch through your security cameras from a safe location. For situations that turn dangerous, SkyControl comes with a  panic button to sound the alarm and open instant communication with security monitoring teams.









Easy and intuitive navigation
Centralizing home controls onto one dashboard creates seamless smart home experiences that you might not notice until you remember them later. With its high-definition touch-screen, SkyControl gives you easy access to your smart home, convenient notifications, and a place to review all your home security video.










Encrypted network



Backup battery



Wireless signal



Secure signal. Secure home. 
It takes a secure wireless network to create complete home security. Vivint SkyControl encrypts smart home signals to secure both video and smart home devices. And the bright, HD display shows you a glowing signal of your home’s status from across the room.


Stay protected when the power goes out
Sometimes a storm might knock out power. Other times, it's a motivated burglar with insulated wire cutters. In either case, SkyControl's backup battery keeps your smart home controls, your security system, and your notifications working long enough to keep your home safe.


Leave the wires for the birds
The centerpiece of Vivint Smart Home systems, SkyControl moderates all wireless communications between you and and the Vivint Smart Home cloud. Wireless functionality gives you better protection. And a dedicated cellular connection means more reliable communication and no solid lines for burglars to cut.

Frequently Asked Questions


What is a smart home?
+


 A smart home is a home that is equipped with technology to remotely control and automate household systems like lighting, doors, thermostats, entertainment systems, security alarms, surveillance cameras and other connected appliances. But it’s more than just remote controls. Smart home introduces artificial intelligence to transcend the remote controls and programmable settings that have been standard home features for the past several decades, to create a centralized, self-regulating home monitoring, control, and energy conservation ecosystem. Learn more about smart home here.

What is home automation?
+


 Home automation refers to technology installed in homes to remotely control and automate household systems like lighting, doors, heating & air conditioning, entertainment systems, security alarms, surveillance cameras and other connected appliances. The programmable thermostats, sprinkler systems, coffee makers, and entertainment systems that have been standard home features for decades can be considered home automation. But by today’s technological standards, the term home automation typically refers to a more advanced and complex set of components. To learn more about home automation, click here.

How to make your home smart
+


 To make your home smart, all you need to do is combine smart components like doorbell cameras, security cameras, smart thermostats, door & window sensors, smoke detectors, and other home control devices into a unified network with a central control dashboard and an artificial intelligence algorithm. When you install a smart home platform like Vivint Smart Home Cloud, for example, managing your home gets significantly more convenient. With Vivint Smart Home Cloud, you’ll no longer need to switch between different home control apps or walk through the house flipping switches by hand.

Where all your home controls come together
No more wandering the house flipping switches and punching keypads before bed. Vivint SkyControl Panel is a smart home hub that bundles all your smart home controls in one place, giving you control of lights, locks, garage doors, thermostats, and security systems from one spot.






A panic button to call for immediate help
If you notice someone prowling your property, SkyControl lets you watch through your security cameras from a safe location. For situations that turn dangerous, SkyControl comes with a  panic button to sound the alarm and open instant communication with security monitoring teams.






A panic button to call for immediate help
If you notice someone prowling your property, SkyControl lets you watch through your security cameras from a safe location. For situations that turn dangerous, SkyControl comes with a  panic button to sound the alarm and open instant communication with security monitoring teams.









Easy and intuitive navigation
Centralizing home controls onto one dashboard creates seamless smart home experiences that you might not notice until you remember them later. With its high-definition touch-screen, SkyControl gives you easy access to your smart home, convenient notifications, and a place to review all your home security video.










Encrypted network



Backup battery



Wireless signal



Secure signal. Secure home. 
It takes a secure wireless network to create complete home security. Vivint SkyControl encrypts smart home signals to secure both video and smart home devices. And the bright, HD display shows you a glowing signal of your home’s status from across the room.


Stay protected when the power goes out
Sometimes a storm might knock out power. Other times, it's a motivated burglar with insulated wire cutters. In either case, SkyControl's backup battery keeps your smart home controls, your security system, and your notifications working long enough to keep your home safe.


Leave the wires for the birds
The centerpiece of Vivint Smart Home systems, SkyControl moderates all wireless communications between you and and the Vivint Smart Home cloud. Wireless functionality gives you better protection. And a dedicated cellular connection means more reliable communication and no solid lines for burglars to cut.

Glance gives you the same seven-inch HD touchscreen with the same user interface as SkyControl. When you add Glance to your  smart home system, you can watch high-resolution  video clips from your surveillance cameras  without leaving your chair.


Controls that instantly feel familiar
Glance makes you feel right at home because  home is something familiar. Glance gives you the same elegant dashboard as SkyControl to make navigating between all your smart home components an act of intuition.


See, hear, and speak to guests from
A built-in speaker and microphone provide two-way communication between Vivint Doorbell Camera, and Ping Camera. If you're in another room, and a guest arrives, Glance lets you quickly greet them, unlock the door, and lock up behind them.

Shows you everything outside your door, day or night
Vivint Doorbell Camera brings elegant design, understated form, and high-tech function to your entryway. More useful than a doorbell, more subtle than a security camera, with a 180-degree lens, HD resolution, and infrared night vision to see everything outside your door at all hours.











Minimalist design that blends seamlessly into your doorway
An ominous surveillance camera overlooking a welcome mat might send visitors a mixed message. The minimalist design mimics a regular doorbell. It blends seamlessly with your home exterior to keep your entryway feeling like a meeting place instead of a TSA checkpoint.











Two-way talk lets you answer your door from anywhere
With its built-in two-way talk, Vivint Doorbell Camera lets you talk to visitors even when you’re away. That way you can get package deliveries stored someplace safe, not left out in the open. And when a surprise visitor shows up, you can make other arrangements.












Smart alerts that give advance notice of surprise visitors
You can’t predict who might show up unannounced, or when. With a discreet camera built into your doorbell, it won’t matter. Smart motion detection notifies you when someone approaches so you’ll know they’re outside before they ever ring. You’ll know even if they knock.















Smart home controls that extend the reach of your hospitality
With Vivint Doorbell Camera’s integration into the Vivint Smart Home platform, you can talk to visitors, unlock doors, and turn on lights from within a single app. That means you won’t need to leave dinner guests waiting on your doorstep when you get delayed.












Smart motion detection knows what to record and what to ignore
Vivint Doorbell Camera’s visitor detection distinguishes people from passing cars, dancing shadows, or waving branches. Real visitors activate 30-second, Smart Clips recordings that get saved for 45 days to give you time to catch up on what you’ve missed.












Save all the important moments with Vivint Playback
Vivint Playback upgrade adds 24/7 recording to the experience. Recordings upload wirelessly to the Playback storage device, so WiFi networks won't crash. And since it all integrates into one smart home system, you can view recordings from the Vivint mobile app.











Professional Installation with Vivint Smart Home Pros
Qualified and licensed Smart Home Pros handle installation so you can focus on your life. Our installation teams will make sure your doorbell camera blends with your home exterior, links up seamlessly with your Vivint Smart Home system and works the way you want it too.

Frequently Asked Questions


What is a smart home?
+


 A smart home is a home that is equipped with technology to remotely control and automate household systems like lighting, doors, thermostats, entertainment systems, security alarms, surveillance cameras and other connected appliances. But it’s more than just remote controls. Smart home introduces artificial intelligence to transcend the remote controls and programmable settings that have been standard home features for the past several decades, to create a centralized, self-regulating home monitoring, control, and energy conservation ecosystem.

What is home automation?
+


 Home automation refers to technology installed in homes to remotely control and automate household systems like lighting, doors, heating & air conditioning, entertainment systems, security alarms, surveillance cameras and other connected appliances. The programmable thermostats, sprinkler systems, coffee makers, and entertainment systems that have been standard home features for decades can be considered home automation. But by today’s technological standards, the term home automation typically refers to a more advanced and complex set of components. To learn more about home automation, click here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
