Broadview Introduces Quote to Contract Tool for Agents to Accelerate UC Adoption
Apr 25 17
Broadview Networks introduced the latest enhancement to its online portal, MyOfficeSuite Agent, with Quote to Contract. In a single virtual or face-to-face meeting with a customer, Quote to Contract allows agents to create quotes and turn them into executable contracts within minutes right through the portal. When combined with Broadview's Order Wizard, a complete UC suite, including a business phone system, audio and video web conferencing, chat and more, can be ordered, configured and installed by the next day. Agents can easily expedite the order process with Broadview's unique tools that eliminate delays usually associated with switching platforms, such as waiting for paperwork and dialogue with product managers, so sales momentum is maintained. Agents can even preconfigure the entire system, including adding phone numbers and creating extensions and auto attendants, before installation so that customers can immediately begin to use the system once activated. The streamlined process allows agents to be more responsive to customers making a move to the cloud without interrupting their critical communications.

Broadview Networks is a network-based electronically integrated communications provider serving small and medium-sized businesses in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. The Company offers integrated communications solutions, including local, long-distance and international voice services; data services that encompass VPN and MPLS enabled offerings; hosted and premises-based VOIP systems; traditional telephone systems; and Internet access services using digital subscriber line (DSL) and related technologies.
Broadview raised over $320 million in total venture capital funding since its founding in 1996. Shareholders included Baker Capital, MCG Capital Corp., New Enterprise Associates, ComVentures, WPG Enterprise Fund, Apollo Management and Trimaran Capital Partners. In late 2007, Broadview filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise approximately $287.5 million in an initial public offering.[1]
Broadview acquired a number of businesses since its founding in 1996. Broadview acquired a portion of the business customer base of RCN Corporation, certain Net2000 Communications assets earlier acquired by Cavalier Telephone and the DSL business of IDT Corporation In 2006, Broadview purchased ATX Communications, an integrated communications and managed services provider. In 2007, the company purchased InfoHighway Communications, a provider of hosted and managed communications solutions.[1]
In August 2012 Broadview filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It exited the process in October 2012.[2]
On April 13, 2017 It was announced that Broadview would be acquired by Windstream Holdings in an all-cash transaction valued at $227.5 million. [3]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
