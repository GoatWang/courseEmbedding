Important InformationAberdeen Asset Management Inc. has prepared this report based on information sources believed to be accurate and reliable.  However, the figures are unaudited and neither the Fund, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the Investment Manager), nor any other person guarantees their accuracy.  Investors should seek their own professional advice and should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before acting on this information. 
Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the "Investment Manager") and Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the "Administrator") are each a subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC ("Aberdeen PLC").  On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a merger ("Merger"). The Boards of each of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC believe that the Merger has a compelling strategic and financial rationale through combining complementary strengths to create a world-class investment group. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger.  In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
Total return figures with distributions reinvested at the dividend reinvestment price are stated net-of-fees and represents past performance.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, current performance may be higher or lower.  Holdings are subject to change and are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities shown.  Inception date November 29, 1993.
If you wish to receive this information electronically, please contact: InvestorRelations@aberdeen-asset.com.

		                                    The Asia Tigers Fund, Inc.(NYSE: GRR)
Investing in locally researched companies domiciledin the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan. 





















								Investment Objective




The Fund’s investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, which it seeks to achieve by investing primarily in equity securities of Asian companies.
Investment Policies
Under normal conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of the value of its assets in equity securities of Asia companies.
The information contained above provides only a brief summary description of the Fund's investment objective and investment policies.
For more detailed information on the specific risks associated with this Fund, please view the Fund’s Important Risk Considerations.

Factsheet
Commentary

Risk Considerations
International investing entails special risk considerations, including currency ﬂuctuations, lower liquidity, economic and political risks, and differences in accounting methods.
There are also risks associated with investing in Asian countries. These risks are enhanced in emerging markets countries. Concentrating investments in the Asia region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds.
Equity stocks of small and mid-cap companies carry greater risk, and more volatility than equity stocks of larger, more established companies.

PHILADELPHIA, July 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Asia Tigers Fund, Inc. (NYSE:    GRR) (the "Fund"), a closed-end equity fund, announced today that it will pay a distribution of US$0.0700 per share on July 31, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of July 24, 2017.  This distribution is comprised of $0.0674 per share of net investment income and $0.0026 per share of net realized long-term capital gains.








In January 2018, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders, which will state the amount and composition of distributions and provide information with respect to their appropriate tax treatment for the 2017 calendar year.    
The Fund is managed and advised by Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited. The Fund's shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol "GRR". 
You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution.  
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
