Abstract:  A gas emulsion forming composition comprising a dry, hollow, particulate, approximately microspherical material permeated with a gas or gas mixture, which upon dissolution in aqueous liquid forms a gas emulsion comprising a plurality of bubbles surrounded by a layer of at least a first and a second surfactant, wherein the first surfactant consists essentially of a phospholipid or mixture of phospholipids having at least one acyl chain which comprises at least 10 carbon atoms, and comprising at least about 5% w/w of total surfactant, and wherein the second surfactant may or may not be a phospholipid and is more water soluble than the first surfactant; kits for preparing such microbubbles; and methods for using such microbubbles as contrast agents.

Stabilization of fluorocarbon emulsions



Patent number:  5628930
                                            

Abstract:  Storage stable fluorocarbon emulsions having a continuous aqueous phase and a discontinuous fluorocarbon phase, in which the fluorocarbon phase comprises a major amount of a first fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon mixture, and a minor amount of a second fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon mixture, in which the second fluorocarbon has a molecular weight greater than that of the first fluorocarbon and the second fluorocarbon includes a lipophilic moiety in its structure, whereby the second fluorocarbon serves to promote particle size stability in the emulsion while simultaneously providing favorably short organ retention times when administered to animals in vivo.
