Artist Statement"There is a place in Far West Texas where night skies are dark as coal and rivers carve temple-like canyons in ancient limestone. Big Bend National Park sits in splendid isolation, waiting to be discovered." - Aaron BatesAaron Bates is a photographer and graphic designer based in Austin, TX. He is an advocate for conservation and a supporter of our national parks, state parks and all wild places in between. Aaron enjoys photographing our parks and sharing his images About See AmericaSee America is reviving the legacy of the New Deal arts projects by building a new collection of posters celebrating our shared natural landmarks and treasured sites. Proceeds support National Parks Conservation Association, the independent, nonpartisan voice working to strengthen and protect our nation’s natural, historical, and cultural heritage.About our PrintsEach poster is hand-printed and handled, to make sure that only the highest quality is offered and sent out. The matte paper and high quality of inks make for a vibrant image which looks great both framed, and au-naturel. Printed in Los Angeles, CA, on Epson Enhanced Matte Paper, heavyweight stock, high color gamut, using Epson UltraChrome HDR ink-jet technology. Framed posters offer the same, museum-quality printed poster, but wrapped in a protective black frame. The frame is lightweight and includes a shatter-resistant acrylite front protector, so it won't break in the mail. International orders may be subject to customs duties & taxes.

who God is. Over and over again the Israelites were instructed
to remember both His great mercy and His mighty actions on 
their behalf.
For the believers, it is equally important to have God’s character
always before our eyes … but what about our ears?
Combining beautiful piano arrangements with well-beloved hymns such as 
“Jesus Loves Even Me,” “Holy, Holy, Holy,” “It is Well 
with My Soul,” and many more, Erin Bates’ incredible piano solo performance 
will help you pause and reflect on how merciful and mighty our God truly is!
