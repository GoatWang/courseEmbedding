Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

                                            In a word: horrible. Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

TCF Bank


                                            TCF Customer Service is of the lowest level of all banks in the United States.  I have been attempting to get assistance with  access to my account after their conversion to digital.  I have been on hold for over 2 hours.

                                            IQ has really friendly staff. Their call center staff are great. But walk through the front doors and the IQ drops significantly!

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

EDITOR'S REVIEW
Is Richard Mille's RM 023 the future of watches for women? The Swiss watchmaker is intent on forging a new path in horology with its technically advanced timepieces. The skeletonised RM 023 Automatic, designed to be worn by men and women, made its first appearance in 2009. Recently redesigned, with new dimensions that sit comfortably between the RM 007 and RM 010, the elegant skeletonized dial has an asymmetric design, with appliqué Roman numberals on sapphire. This is a watch for a woman who appreciates her complications. With hours, minutes, seconds, date and adjustable rotor geometry, the main components in the skeletonized automatic movement have been manufactured from grade 2 titalnium with black PVD coating for optimum rigidity.
