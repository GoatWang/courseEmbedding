Career[edit]
Coleman began his career in the U.S. Air Force as Chief of Satellite Operations in the Office of the Secretary. In 1995, he co-founded BEA Systems, where he was chairman of the board. Coleman and two others started BEA to create software tools that tie corporate software applications together. The company was an enterprise application and service infrastructure software provider. In 2001, Business Week Online valued his stake in BEA Systems at $500 million.[2][4] Coleman's tenure as chairman of the board lasted until August 2002. Concurrently, he was also chief strategy officer from October 2001 until August 2002, and chief executive officer from 1995 to October 2001.
Before co-founding BEA Systems, Coleman was the head of Sun Microsystems' professional services and software development units, and co-founded Dest Systems, where he then headed engineering. Coleman also held positions as a director of product development at VisiCorp and manager of the High Frequency Systems Group at GTE Sylvania. Since June 2010, he has been an operating partner of Alsop Louie Partners, a venture fund that invests primarily in early-stage technology.[2][3]
Coleman has been a director of Symantec Corp. since January 14, 2003. He is a Member of the Trilateral Commission, and also serves as a member of the audit committee. He is a Member of the Information Technology Advisory Board at Warburg Pincus. Additionally, he is a member of the board of directors of Nexant, Inc, and on the board of directors and advisory council of the Business Executives for National Security. He was previously a director of a variety of companies, including Cassatt Corporation and Palm, Inc.[2][3][5]
Alsop Louie Partners[edit]
Since December 2010, Coleman has been an operating partner at Alsop Louie Partners, a venture fund that invests primarily in early-stage technology.[3][6]
Cassatt Corporation[edit]
Coleman was the founder, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Cassatt Corporation from August 2003 until June 2009. The Menlo Park, California-based company offers "software and services to help enterprises implement agile business architectures which adapt to meet changing workplace requirements".[2] The company is funded by Warburg Pincus LLP, a global private equity firm. The Cassatt management team includes Coleman, Brian Berliner, Mark Forman, Paul Hoffman, Dave McAllister, Steven Oberlin and Karen Willem.
Veritas Technologies[edit]
Carlyle Group struck the largest IT buyout deal of 2015 to acquire the data backup and information management group from IT security giant Symantec last August, with the deal completed at the start of February.Bill Coleman was appointed by Carlyle Group last year as the new CEO of the company.
Honors[edit]
In 2010, Coleman was listed as 827th on the Forbes Global 2000, which is a list he has been on each year since 2003. In 2009, he was listed in Forbes 400 Best Big Companies, a list that he had been on consecutively from 2003 to 2005. Other lists he has been on as director of Symantec Corporation include[7]

Named by Business Week as one of 2001's E-biz 25 Top Executives.

Philanthropy[edit]
Coleman's philanthropic focus has been broadly to take a local and hands-on approach to giving-back to society, and has been inspired by his niece's cognitive disability. Having seen her cognitive abilities improve with the advent of technology and the computer, he and his wife decided to focus specifically on finding treatments for cognitive disabilities with technology. In 2000, Coleman and his wife initiated a long-term partnership with the University of Colorado, with their donations going towards the construction of the Coleman Institute for Cognitive Disabilities. Coleman is now the president of the University of Colorado Boulder's Coleman Institute for Cognitive Disabilities.[8]
One of Coleman and his wife's contributions has been the Coleman-Turner Chair in Cognitive Disability. Since its institution, David Braddock, PhD, Associate Vice President of the University of Colorado, has acted as executive director for the chair.[8]
The Coleman Institute[edit]
The Coleman Institute for Cognitive Disabilities was established in 2001, and dedicates its advanced development and research capacities towards the improvement of the afflicted, and exists solely to catalyse and integrate advances in science, engineering and technology to promote the quality of life and independent living of those with cognitive disabilities.[8][9] Their original endowment towards the institute was a sum of $250 million, and they have continued their donations towards the annually to further its programs and research projects.[8]

Early life and education[edit]
Coleman was born to William Thaddeus Coleman Sr. and Laura Beatrice (née Mason) Coleman in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[1] Coleman's mother came from six generations of Episcopal ministers, including an operator of the Underground Railroad.[1] W.E.B. DuBois and Langston Hughes would visit the family’s home for dinner.[1] One of seven black students at Germantown High School, Coleman was suspended for cursing at a teacher after she praised his honors presentation by saying, "Someday, William, you will make a wonderful chauffeur."[1] When Coleman attempted to join the school's swim team he was again suspended, and the team disbanded after he returned so as to avoid admitting him, only to reform after he graduated.[1] Coleman’s swim team coach wrote him a strong letter of recommendation and he was accepted into the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a double major in political science and economics.[1]
He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in history in 1941.[2] There, he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society.[2] He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society in 1941.[3] Coleman was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[4]
Colman was accepted to the Harvard Law School but left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Corps, failing in his attempt to join the Tuskeegee Airmen.[1] Instead, Coleman spent the war defending the accused in court-martials.[1] After the war, Coleman returned to Harvard Law, where he became the first black staff member accepted to the Harvard Law Review, and graduated first in his class and magna cum laude in 1946.[1]
Career[edit]
He began his legal career in 1947, serving as law clerk to Judge Herbert F. Goodrich of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter in 1948. He was the first African American to serve as a Supreme Court law clerk.[5] Fellow clerks, including Elliot Richardson, would have difficulty finding a restaurant where they could eat together.[1]
Coleman was hired by the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in 1949.[6] Thurgood Marshall, then the chief counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, recruited Coleman to be one of the lead strategists and coauthor of the legal brief in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.[1]
He served as a member of the NAACP's national legal committee, director and member of its executive committee, and president of board of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Coleman was also a member of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Committee on Government Employment Policy (1959–1961) and a consultant to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1963–1975). Coleman served as an assistant counsel to the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (1964), also known as the Warren Commission, on which then-Congressman Gerald Ford was a commissioner.[1]
During the Warren Commission's investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Commission received word via a backchannel that Fidel Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, wanted to talk to them. The Commission sent Coleman as an investigator and he met with Castro on a fishing boat off the coast of Cuba. Castro denied any involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy during Coleman's three-hour questioning. Coleman reported the results of his investigation and interview with Castro directly to Commission Chairman Earl Warren, the Chief Justice of the United States.[7]
Coleman was co-counsel to the petitioners in McLaughlin v. Florida (1964), in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down a law prohibiting an interracial couple from living together.[1] In 1969, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the twenty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Coleman was also a member of the National Commission on Productivity (1971–1972). Coleman served in the boardrooms of PepsiCo, IBM, Chase Manhattan Bank, and Pan American World Airways.[1] He was senior partner in the law firm of Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish, Levy & Coleman at the time of his appointment to the Ford Administration.
Cabinet post[edit]




Flag of the United States Secretary of Transportation


President Gerald Ford appointed Coleman to serve in the Cabinet of the United States as the fourth United States Secretary of Transportation on March 7, 1975.[8] During Coleman's tenure at the United States Department of Transportation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's automobile test facility at East Liberty, Ohio commenced operations, and the Department established the Materials Transportation Bureau to address pipeline safety and the safe shipment of hazardous materials. In May 1976, Coleman authorized a testing period for the supersonic Concorde jet.[1] After the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey banned the jet, the U.S. Supreme Court restored Coleman’s authorization.[1] In December 1976, Coleman rejected consumer activists’ pressure for a federal mandate on automobile airbags and instead announced a two-year demonstration period favored by the auto industry.[1] Coleman's tenure ended after Jimmy Carter won the United States presidential election, 1976.
Post-Cabinet service and honors[edit]

On leaving the department, Coleman returned to Philadelphia and subsequently became a partner in the Washington office of the Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny & Myers. Colman argued a total of 19 cases before the Supreme Court.[1] He appeared for the respondent in the argument and reargument of Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985). In 1983, with the election quickly approaching, the Reagan administration stopped supporting the IRS's position against Bob Jones University that overtly discriminatory groups were ineligible for certain tax exemptions. Coleman was appointed to argue the now unsupported lower court position before the Supreme Court, and won in Bob Jones University v. United States.[9]
On September 29, 1995, Coleman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. After the July 17, 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, he served on the President's Commission on Airline and Airport Security. Coleman received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College in 1975. Coleman was also awarded honorary degrees from, among others, Williams College in May 1975, Gettysburg College on May 22, 2011,[10] and Boston University in May 2012.
In September 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Coleman to the United States Court of Military Commission Review.[8]
In December 2006, Coleman served as an honorary pallbearer during the state funeral of Gerald Ford in Washington, D.C..[11][not specific enough to verify][12]
Personal life[edit]
In 1945, he married Lovida Mae Hardin. They have three children: Lovida H. Coleman, William Thaddeus Coleman III, a General Counsel of the Army under President Clinton; stepfather of Flavia Colgan, and Hardin Coleman, dean, Boston University School of Education.
Coleman, Jr. died from complications of Alzheimer's disease at his home in Alexandria, Virginia on March 31, 2017, aged 96.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Coleman was born to William Thaddeus Coleman Sr. and Laura Beatrice (née Mason) Coleman in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[1] Coleman's mother came from six generations of Episcopal ministers, including an operator of the Underground Railroad.[1] W.E.B. DuBois and Langston Hughes would visit the family’s home for dinner.[1] One of seven black students at Germantown High School, Coleman was suspended for cursing at a teacher after she praised his honors presentation by saying, "Someday, William, you will make a wonderful chauffeur."[1] When Coleman attempted to join the school's swim team he was again suspended, and the team disbanded after he returned so as to avoid admitting him, only to reform after he graduated.[1] Coleman’s swim team coach wrote him a strong letter of recommendation and he was accepted into the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a double major in political science and economics.[1]
He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in history in 1941.[2] There, he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society.[2] He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society in 1941.[3] Coleman was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[4]
Colman was accepted to the Harvard Law School but left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Corps, failing in his attempt to join the Tuskeegee Airmen.[1] Instead, Coleman spent the war defending the accused in court-martials.[1] After the war, Coleman returned to Harvard Law, where he became the first black staff member accepted to the Harvard Law Review, and graduated first in his class and magna cum laude in 1946.[1]
Career[edit]
He began his legal career in 1947, serving as law clerk to Judge Herbert F. Goodrich of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter in 1948. He was the first African American to serve as a Supreme Court law clerk.[5] Fellow clerks, including Elliot Richardson, would have difficulty finding a restaurant where they could eat together.[1]
Coleman was hired by the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in 1949.[6] Thurgood Marshall, then the chief counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, recruited Coleman to be one of the lead strategists and coauthor of the legal brief in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.[1]
He served as a member of the NAACP's national legal committee, director and member of its executive committee, and president of board of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Coleman was also a member of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Committee on Government Employment Policy (1959–1961) and a consultant to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1963–1975). Coleman served as an assistant counsel to the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (1964), also known as the Warren Commission, on which then-Congressman Gerald Ford was a commissioner.[1]
During the Warren Commission's investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Commission received word via a backchannel that Fidel Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, wanted to talk to them. The Commission sent Coleman as an investigator and he met with Castro on a fishing boat off the coast of Cuba. Castro denied any involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy during Coleman's three-hour questioning. Coleman reported the results of his investigation and interview with Castro directly to Commission Chairman Earl Warren, the Chief Justice of the United States.[7]
Coleman was co-counsel to the petitioners in McLaughlin v. Florida (1964), in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down a law prohibiting an interracial couple from living together.[1] In 1969, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the twenty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Coleman was also a member of the National Commission on Productivity (1971–1972). Coleman served in the boardrooms of PepsiCo, IBM, Chase Manhattan Bank, and Pan American World Airways.[1] He was senior partner in the law firm of Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish, Levy & Coleman at the time of his appointment to the Ford Administration.
Cabinet post[edit]




Flag of the United States Secretary of Transportation


President Gerald Ford appointed Coleman to serve in the Cabinet of the United States as the fourth United States Secretary of Transportation on March 7, 1975.[8] During Coleman's tenure at the United States Department of Transportation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's automobile test facility at East Liberty, Ohio commenced operations, and the Department established the Materials Transportation Bureau to address pipeline safety and the safe shipment of hazardous materials. In May 1976, Coleman authorized a testing period for the supersonic Concorde jet.[1] After the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey banned the jet, the U.S. Supreme Court restored Coleman’s authorization.[1] In December 1976, Coleman rejected consumer activists’ pressure for a federal mandate on automobile airbags and instead announced a two-year demonstration period favored by the auto industry.[1] Coleman's tenure ended after Jimmy Carter won the United States presidential election, 1976.
Post-Cabinet service and honors[edit]

On leaving the department, Coleman returned to Philadelphia and subsequently became a partner in the Washington office of the Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny & Myers. Colman argued a total of 19 cases before the Supreme Court.[1] He appeared for the respondent in the argument and reargument of Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985). In 1983, with the election quickly approaching, the Reagan administration stopped supporting the IRS's position against Bob Jones University that overtly discriminatory groups were ineligible for certain tax exemptions. Coleman was appointed to argue the now unsupported lower court position before the Supreme Court, and won in Bob Jones University v. United States.[9]
On September 29, 1995, Coleman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. After the July 17, 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, he served on the President's Commission on Airline and Airport Security. Coleman received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College in 1975. Coleman was also awarded honorary degrees from, among others, Williams College in May 1975, Gettysburg College on May 22, 2011,[10] and Boston University in May 2012.
In September 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Coleman to the United States Court of Military Commission Review.[8]
In December 2006, Coleman served as an honorary pallbearer during the state funeral of Gerald Ford in Washington, D.C..[11][not specific enough to verify][12]
Personal life[edit]
In 1945, he married Lovida Mae Hardin. They have three children: Lovida H. Coleman, William Thaddeus Coleman III, a General Counsel of the Army under President Clinton; stepfather of Flavia Colgan, and Hardin Coleman, dean, Boston University School of Education.
Coleman, Jr. died from complications of Alzheimer's disease at his home in Alexandria, Virginia on March 31, 2017, aged 96.[1]

Bob Jones III commented that 'this puts the court in the position of creating an issue to be litigated and insisting that an issue be heard when one of the two litigants declares 'no contest'.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them. And if you ever want a place to discuss your passions, your knowledge, or your warnings about products, our forum is one of the more comprehensive places to do it.

So don’t take our word for it, check it out for yourself and see everything eReplacementParts.com has to offer.

						What Our Loyal Customers Have To Say					

						Just a short note to say thanks for the information and parts you provide. I have been able to resurrect and maintain a wide variety of tools thanks to the schematics and amazing array of parts you can supply.					

						Chris D.					

						Maryland, USA					


					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.
