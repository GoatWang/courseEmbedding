We leave the nuances of the curriculum to you while supporting other aspects of your program. Our proven track record of exceeding projected outcomes makes us a prime candidate in helping you navigate program viability with flexibility and ease. 













































All Campus has been an excellent partner with the USC Marshall School of Business. The entire team is dedicated to our mission and to a standard of excellence in creativity, quality and professionalism, and we are pleased with their student recruitment efforts.

Sandra Chrystal Vice Dean for Online Education




All Campus has provided us with the recruiting and marketing services that we needed to launch and successfully scale our Master of Science degree. The All Campus team is made of creative professionals that possess the appropriate acumen and passion that has allowed our program to thrive. We experienced a 900% increase in enrollment within the first year with their assistance and we have thoroughly enjoyed working with the talented group of staff devoted to our account.

Michael SagasDepartment Chair and ProfessorDepartment of Tourism, Recreation & Sport Management




We knew we had a great Master of Science in Criminal Justice program, but it was simply surviving, not thriving. With All Campus as our marketing, recruitment and retention partner, enrollment is growing substantially. Their professionalism is top-notch, their approach is sensible, their skills are outstanding, and their service is always delivered with our best interest in mind. Our relationship with All Campus is a partnership in every sense of the word.

Creative ServicesOur team of talented designers create customized, one-of-a-kind websites, brochures, and other collateral that suit your school’s brand guidelines.



Corporate PartnersWe promote your program through our network of 400 partner corporations, nonprofits, benefits providers, and other organizations to encourage employee development and recruit qualified students.

Bold Strategies, Proven Results.
Expand Your Online Enrollment.
In response to the growing demand for online education, leading universities nationwide are working furiously to create digital course offerings that reflect the same quality and sense of community as their on-campus experience. That said, building, leading, and recruiting for these programs takes significant time and resources while involving a considerable amount of financial risk. These roadblocks can prevent a school from reaching its full market potential within this growing audience of prospective students.
That’s where we come in.
All Campus partners with non-profit, traditional institutions of higher education to provide essential support, helping clients explore the possibilities of online learning. A partnership with All Campus is close, dedicated, and flexible, allowing you and your school to select a range of services to suit your needs — whether you’re seeking sophisticated, data-driven recruitment strategies, proven enrollment expertise, or individualized creative designs. Every service we offer is driven by hard data and demonstrated creative results, creating the effective blend of science and art that characterizes everything we do.
In short, we can help you attract passionate, engaged students to your online programs — all while working within the voice and brand of your university.

RhinoWare™ Door Barricade can be easily engaged in an active shooter lockdown situation, preventing unwanted intrusion and the distress such an event can bring. The devices are low profile/visibility and unobtrusive, but highly effective as a barricade that even a kindergartner, under severe duress, can engage the device in just one second!
RhinoWare™ Door Barricade, constructed of powder coated cold rolled American steel, is a substantial, yet simple mechanism which can secure and fortify an entryway door to withstand several tons of direct sustained force. Easily engaged, a classroom can be effectively locked down, even if the door cannot be locked or secured by conventional means.
Once installed the device remains securely in place at the bottom of the entry door and on the floor - ready for use at any time. The RhinoWare's intuitive design and ease of use afford the ability to operate the unit with no training required.  Simply lift the locking mechanism up from the tab and let go and it is automaticaly guided down into the floor plate slot.  To disengage, simply lift the locking mechanism up from the tab and rotate into its' seated position.  Simple yet extremely effective! RhinoWare™ is designed and constructed to provide superior protection for many years.  
Fire and Life Safety Code compliance is oftentimes a local issue.  We are happy to announce that RhinoWare™ Door Barricade has received Fire Marshal approval in many states across the country!  Contact us and we will provide the support and information necessary to achieve Fire Marshal approval in your area.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
