Welcome to Bowen, Hanes & Company
Bowen, Hanes & Company, headquartered in Atlanta, GA,
	with an office in Winston-Salem, NC, has been providing investment
	counseling services to individuals and institutions for the past four
	decades.  Since inception, it has been our mission to
	produce and provide a service in a manner consistent with our high-quality,
	long-term approach.  The exclusive focus will continue to
	be on adding value by offering a superior product, thus allowing us to
	establish and maintain mutually beneficial relationships.  

 
The firm operates according to a carefully formulated
	strategy.  We emphasize quality and are dedicated to our
	primary mission, meeting the needs and long-term objectives of our clients,
	who rely on us to increase their financial worth, benefits to their
	employees, and funds available for education and charitable purposes.
 
When implementing investment decisions, we rely
	primarily on our analysis of global economic trends and their impact on
	specific industries and companies.  This is followed by a
	rigorous review of company-specific balance sheet and income statistics and
	their relationship to our estimates of future sales and earnings growth
	potential.  Although familiar with modern portfolio
	theories and other academic or technical strategies, we believe their value
	is limited for long-term investment.
 
It is our intention to remain a compact organization,
	enabling us to provide a high level of personal attention by allowing
	clients to work closely with the senior executives of the firm.

INVESTMENT STYLE & PHILOSOPHY
 Broad Global Trend Analysis
 Our top-down approach is rooted in the belief that the analysis of various global
    trends is vital when allocating funds to financial assets. Thus, we begin with a
    broad analysis of global macroeconomic, political, and technological trends, with
    our objective being to ascertain how these trends will impact the financial markets.

 Industry Analysis
 It is only after answering these broad questions that we begin our industry analysis.
    Our top-down approach leads us to emphasize those sectors that we feel have the
    most potential in terms of growing their revenues and earnings not only in the U.S.,
    but in virtually every region in the world. Particular emphasis is given to those
    industries and companies that have a strategic and international business plan that
    focuses on those countries that display economic vibrancy, including currency stability,
    rising real incomes, and improving living standards.


Company Analysis
While certainly not the least important, examining the individual company is the                      last component of our analysis. We use a variety of proprietary valuation techniques                      to assess whether a company warrants investment consideration.  READ MORE





 continued


                    With this type of

                    approach, we are both growth and value managers. Rigid analysis of economic, political,

                    and technological trends leads us to the industries that we feel have the most growth

                    potential. We then look for companies that we think represent the best value within

                    those industries. This means that we are going to be overweighted in certain industries

                    and underweighted in others. In many instances, clients rely on Bowen, Hanes to manage their funds in a balanced

                    fashion to include both stocks and bonds. When employing such an approach, equities

                    are relied upon for capital appreciation while fixed income securities are used

                    for stability and income.Fixed Income The strategy for fixed income places a major emphasis

                    on the following:

Interest Rate Anticipation - Commitments to securities are made when value is perceived

                        from both a price and yield standpoint.
Preservation of Capital - Quality and safety are of paramount importance when selecting

                        bonds. Thus, we emphasize investment grade securities when making commitments.
Buy and Hold Strategy - The objective is to provide both income and stability as

                        opposed to seeking a total return through aggressive trading.

Welcome to Bowen, Hanes & Company
Bowen, Hanes & Company, headquartered in Atlanta, GA,
	with an office in Winston-Salem, NC, has been providing investment
	counseling services to individuals and institutions for the past four
	decades.  Since inception, it has been our mission to
	produce and provide a service in a manner consistent with our high-quality,
	long-term approach.  The exclusive focus will continue to
	be on adding value by offering a superior product, thus allowing us to
	establish and maintain mutually beneficial relationships.  

 
The firm operates according to a carefully formulated
	strategy.  We emphasize quality and are dedicated to our
	primary mission, meeting the needs and long-term objectives of our clients,
	who rely on us to increase their financial worth, benefits to their
	employees, and funds available for education and charitable purposes.
 
When implementing investment decisions, we rely
	primarily on our analysis of global economic trends and their impact on
	specific industries and companies.  This is followed by a
	rigorous review of company-specific balance sheet and income statistics and
	their relationship to our estimates of future sales and earnings growth
	potential.  Although familiar with modern portfolio
	theories and other academic or technical strategies, we believe their value
	is limited for long-term investment.
 
It is our intention to remain a compact organization,
	enabling us to provide a high level of personal attention by allowing
	clients to work closely with the senior executives of the firm.
