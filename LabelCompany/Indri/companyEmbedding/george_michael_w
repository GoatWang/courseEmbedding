Next choose your conditioner…
The 12 Minute Conditioner can be used once a month as a deep conditioner, between the shampoo and the cream rinse. Apply a teaspoon amount or more for thicker or longer hair, concentrating on the ponytail area, work it in a bit. Put a hot wet towel over your hair for at least 12 mins. Rinse out and use cream rinse. Or… use the 60 Second Conditioner- as a daily conditioner, apply the same as above, no need for a towel.
Detangle your hair......then rinse the Cream Rinse.
Detangle your hair using a wide tooth comb while you have the cream rinse in your hair.
Cream rinse – Put mostly on ponytail area, then apply what is left on your hands on the top layer of your hair.
Never brush your hair when it’s wet.
When your hair is dry comb out with a wide tooth comb before you brush.
Never use blowdryers or heating implements!
Roller setting is best to dry long hair.

					I've been looking at them for awhile, but to be very honest they are a little expensive for me.  I don't like starting things that I can't continue. Good luck with his products, and please let us know how they work for you.

I agree. I'm cheap I just think there's other products that may be just as good. It couldn't have any ingredients thats not in anything else, right?

I don't think his products have any magic ingredients, but some products are more effective than others.  I'm curious to know if his products would be beneficial for my hair, but I won't be finding out anytime soon.  Gotta save those pennies.

					Dr. George Michael was known as the "King of Long Hair" and his products are famous everywhere in the Extremely long hair community. Unfortunately he died in 2009 at the age of 90 years old. But his products live on through the MADORA GEORGE MICHAEL SALON in New York City. The products are pricey and is the reason I have never tried them....

Thanks for the links!  

Interestingly, I found this e-how that breaks down his system.  Simply put his suggestions are right in alignment with much that we have learned here.  Moisture and gentle detangling are key.

					Just one other thing... JJJlonghair whose hair is almost floor length, uses his products and highly recommends them. You can read her haircare routine here: http://jjjlonghairphotopage.zoomshare.com/6.html

I talk to her sometimes on the floor length hair boards...

Candy828, I used to stalk JJJ. She's one of the extreme length chicks whose ends are not sickly thin.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDCoroner: George Michael died of natural causesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCoroner: George Michael died of natural causes 01:06Story highlightsSinger, 53, was suffering from heart and liver conditions says coronerHe was found dead at his Oxfordshire home on Christmas Day (CNN)Singer George Michael died of natural causes, it was announced Monday.A coroner said the star, found dead at his home in Oxfordshire on Christmas Day, had a heart condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis.The 53-year-old also suffered from a fatty liver, according to Oxfordshire's senior coroner Darren Salter."Inquiries into the death of George Michael have been concluded and the final post mortem report received," the coroner said, in a statement reported by Britain's Press Association.   "As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further inquiries."Read MoreCauses of heart conditionWhat does it mean to die of 'natural causes?'According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle where it becomes stretched and thin. This means that it is unable to pump blood around the body efficiently.The condition can be inherited, but other causes include viral conditions, uncontrolled high blood pressure and excessive amounts of alcohol. Mycocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, according to the BHF.Britain's National Health Service describes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a condition usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. It can also develop where the liver is damaged after alcohol abuse.
