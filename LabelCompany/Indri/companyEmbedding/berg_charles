Frequently Asked Questions




For your convenience, we've answered some of the most commonly asked questions below. Just click on any question to see the associated answer. If you don't see your question or need more information, please call us today—we're here to help!




Clean or replace your air filter regularly with pleated filters, every month if possible, particularly if you have pets in your home. A clogged filter restricts airflow and as a result your air conditioner will work longer to maintain the temperature. 




How often should I change or clean my filter?




Find a comfortable automatic setting for your home thermostat and try to leave it there. Turning your thermostat off when you leave for work can be counterproductive. You will spend more energy trying to re-cool your house than if you had not adjusted your thermostat in the first place.




What setting should I set my thermostat on?





Choose the company with a reputation for integrity


352-377-0880




Air conditioners, like other machines, wear out over time and become inefficient. This results in higher electrical costs. If your system is more than 10 years old, contact us to find out how you can get a more energy efficient system.




When should I replace my air conditioner?




Many things can determine the size capacity system your home requires. For example: living area of house, climate, humidity, insulation, direction of home. Let us do an energy calculation of your home and help you decide what your energy needs are for your home.




What size system do I need for my new home?




SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio). The amount of cooling your unit, (air conditioner or heat pump), delivers per every electricity dollar spent. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficient the system.




What is the meaning of SEER?




A Heat Pump, a reverse cycle air conditioner, cools and heats by moving heat in or out of your home while a Straight Cool is an air conditioner which uses different sources for heating. It can work with natural gas, oil, an LP gas furnace, or electric furnace.




Heat Pump vs. Straight Cool?




Your A/C unit should generally be serviced twice a year, around spring and fall to assure it is working at its peak performance. Call us for our preventive maintenance inspections.




How often should I service my unit?




Zoning is a method of dividing a home into different areas and each area's heating and air conditioning comfort is independently controlled. Therefore you can control the east side of your home along with west side, and the third zone can take care of everything in the middle. If you have an upstairs then you can add a 4th zone.




What does "Zoning" mean?




Shrubs should not be closer than 18 inches to your outdoor unit. To operate efficiently the unit needs space to take in and blow out air. Also keep in mind that there is a service panel on your unit which must be accessible to the service technician if your unit needs to be worked on. There needs to be at least a 2 feet clearance in front of this panel.




How should I plant shrubs near my outdoor unit?




If the room has a large area of exposed glass, keep curtains or blinds closed during daylight hours, particularly at times when the sun would shine directly in. You might also ask your air conditioning contractor to check whether you are getting enough air in that room. There may be a problem with your duct system.




Why is one room in my home always too hot in the summer and what can I do to make that room more comfortable?




Contact us to receive the best instructions about your drain line and what to do to keep it clear.




What do I do about my drain line?

Air conditioning savings


By charlesbergent880, Aug 6 2015 01:42PM


Running your ceiling fan at night is a great way to keep cool without turning down the AC. If you changed the direction for winter, don't forget to change it back! Your fan should be set counterclockwise in the summer so air flow circulates down.

Don't forget about your fridge during spring cleaning! To make sure it's performing at maximum efficiency, follow these three tips: 1) Vacuum the outside coils. 2) Check seals for air leaks. 3) Adjust temperature settings to be 37-40 degrees.

BergaMet NA Products Now Available on Jet.com
Posted: 

Wednesday, July 19, 2017 3:03 AM EDT




 BergaMet NA, a company known for producing a unique citrus bergamot supplement that helps people obtain some much-needed relief from the symptoms of the new epidemic of the 21st century, metabolic syndrome, announced its products are now available for purchase on Jet.com, a fast-growing online retailer.Boca Raton, FL (PRWEB) July 19, 2017  BergaMet NA, a company known for producing a unique citrus bergamot supplement that helps people obtain some much-needed relief from the symptoms of the new epidemic of the 21st century, metabolic syndrome, announced its products are now available for purchase on Jet.com, a fast-growing online retailer.  BergaMet NA is known for being extremely selective in the ingredients it puts into its products, searching all over the world for the highest quality ingredients that will lead to the best possible products. As a result, the BergaMet line of supplements has achieved an international reputation for being the best citrus bergamot supplements available today. “We are excited to announce that BergaMet products are now available for purchase on Jet.com,” said Logan Decker, Director of Operations for BergaMet NA. “Jet.com is growing extremely quickly and has become a particularly ideal platform for nutritional products and supplements. We are pleased to have another opportunity to reach out to a completely new audience and introduce them to the clinically proven nutritional benefits of bergamot.”BergaMet NA began producing its supplements in 2016 after its founders became familiar with the benefits of the bergamot citrus fruit, and especially those grown in the Calabrian region of Italy. According to researchers and nutritionists, the Italian bergamot provides even stronger support for the cardiovascular system because of its comparatively larger amount of polyphenols and anti-oxidants. These polyphenol-heavy fruits are the basis of BergaMet NA’s supplements, which it sells all over the world.Over the past 5 years, Australian cardiologist Dr. Ross Walker has treated over 5,000 patients with BergaMet while co-authoring numerous studies. According to Walker “I have only used BergaMet.in fact, I have been taking it myself for 4 years.” It has been so gratifying to witness 1000s of my patients getting superb results. So many of my patients get side effects from drugs or prefer a more natural approach. I either use BergaMet alone or combine BergaMet with lower dose statins depending on the clinical situation.”Dr. Walker continues “BergaMet may be the most important nutritional product created in the last 30-50 years. I know of no other supplement or drug that can match its value in addressing so many risk factors contributing to heart disease and diabetes.”There are a few versions of BergaMet available, each of which has specific benefits. BergaMet Mega + O helps people to maintain the proper levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and is one of the company’s popular sellers. BergaFEMME contains most of those same benefits for managing cholesterol, but is a very effective product for pre & post-menopausal women looking to additional address menopausal symptoms.“We are thrilled to be working with Jet.com and to reach out to more people than ever before to help them find relief from their symptoms of metabolic syndrome as it becomes the epidemic of the 21st century,” said Decker.

GENERAL NOTES

Special Legislative Concerns: agriculture, agricultural and wildlife conservation, rural taxation, rail and highway transportation, improving the business climate, environment and natural resources.When first elected he considered himself an independent conservative.  He was opposed to party designations.Religion provided by the Catholic Bulletin, 3/21/1975."He bore the distinction of being the only member of the Legislature to represent both parties and serve as an independent." (Pioneer Press obituary, January 29, 2014)"During his 30 years at the Minnesota Capitol, former state Sen. Charlie Berg was known as a maverick and one of the more colorful, outspoken members of the Legislature." (Pioneer Press obituary, January 29, 2014)"'Whatever label I've got on my back, I've always voted the same way,' he said in 1996. 'I'm a conservative, independent voter, and I'm not going to let the parties dictate to me how I should vote for the district.'" (Pioneer Press obituary, January 29, 2014)
