CPC Tool
THE CARTESIAN FILE CONVERSION TOOL


CPC Tool is a command-line application providing 
powerful batch conversion
capabilities for documents stored in a variety of 
document image formats, including 
TIFF, CALS, PDF, JEDMICS, and Cartesian's own 
CPC format. Cartesian's microscopic CPC
format produces image files that are typically 
5-20 times smaller than TIFF. This dramatic reduction in file size leads directly to 
commensurate reductions in storage and publication costs, network traffic, and download times.

Cartesian product

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A
×
(
B
∩
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∩
(

,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap (A\times C),}

=

[4]

where

{\displaystyle A^{\complement }}

 denotes the absolute complement of A.
Other properties related with subsets are:






if

 then 

A

,


{\displaystyle {\text{if }}A\subseteq B{\text{ then }}A\times C\subseteq B\times C,}

.


{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

[5]

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function

∏

{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n

1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

Cartesian product

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle A\times B}

 of the sets 




A
=
{
x

}

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A
×
(
B
∩
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∩
(

,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap (A\times C),}

Other properties related with subsets are:

{\displaystyle {\text{if }}A\subseteq B{\text{ then }}A\times C\subseteq B\times C,}

.


{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

[5]

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally,

Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

Cartesian product 




A
×
B



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle A\times B}

 of the sets 




A
=
{
x
,
y
,
z
}



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle A=\{x,y,z\}}

 and

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A
×
(
B
∩
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∩
(
A
×

)
,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap (A\times C),}

=
(

=

Other properties related with subsets are:

 then 

A

{\displaystyle {\text{if }}A\subseteq B{\text{ then }}A\times C\subseteq B\times C,}

.


{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

[5]

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

Cartesian product - Wikipedia






















 






Cartesian product

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

"Cartesian square" redirects here. For Cartesian squares in category theory, see Cartesian square (category theory).




Cartesian product 




A
×
B



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle A\times B}

 of the sets 




A
=
{
x
,
y
,
z
}



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle A=\{x,y,z\}}

 and 




B
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
}



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle B=\{1,2,3\}}




In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A
×
(
B
∩
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∩
(
A
×
C
)
,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap (A\times C),}






A
×
(
B
∪
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∪
(
A
×
C
)
,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cup C)=(A\times B)\cup (A\times C),}






A
×
(
B
∖
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∖
(
A
×
C
)
,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\setminus C)=(A\times B)\setminus (A\times C),}

[4]

where 




A

∁




{\displaystyle A^{\complement }}

 denotes the absolute complement of A.
Other properties related with subsets are:






if 

A
⊆
B

 then 

A
×
C
⊆
B
×
C
,


{\displaystyle {\text{if }}A\subseteq B{\text{ then }}A\times C\subseteq B\times C,}







if both

∅

 then 

A

B

⟺

A

C
∧
B
⊆
D
.


{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

[5]

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

Cartesian product

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle A\times B}

 of the sets 




A

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A
×
(
B
∩
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∩
(
A
×
C
)
,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap (A\times C),}






A
×
(
B
∪
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∪
(
A

)
,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cup C)=(A\times B)\cup (A\times C),}






A
×
(
B
∖
C
)
=
(
A

B
)
∖
(
A

{\displaystyle A\times (B\setminus C)=(A\times B)\setminus (A\times C),}

[4]

where 




A

∁




{\displaystyle A^{\complement }}

 denotes the absolute complement of A.
Other properties related with subsets are:






if 

A

B

 then 

A
×
C

B
×
C
,


{\displaystyle {\text{if }}A\subseteq B{\text{ then }}A\times C\subseteq B\times C,}







if both

 then

.


{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

[5]

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

A Set is a collection of distinct and defined elements. Sets are represented by using French braces {} with commas to separate the elements in a Set.Examples of Sets:• The set of all points on a particular line.• The set of all lines in a particular plane.• A set can also contain elements which are themselves sets. For example, a set may contain $4, 5, \{ 6, 7 \}$.






Set Operations



 




There are three basic Set Operations.Intersection of SetsUnion of SetsComplement of SetsIntersection of two sets:The Intersection of two or more sets is a set containing only the common elements among all the sets under consideration. The intersection operation is denoted by the symbol $\cap$. The Intersection of the sets $A$ and $B$ is expressed as $A \cap B$.Union of sets:The Union of two or more sets is a set that contains all the elements of all the sets under consideration. The union of sets is denoted by the symbol $\cup$. The Union of sets $C$ and $D$ is expressed by $C \cup D$. Complement of Sets:The Complement of a set is a set that contains only the elements which are not in the given set but are contained in the universal set. The Complement of a set is denoted by $A$'.• The Complement of an Universal Set is a Null Set. That is, $U$' = $\phi$• The Complement of a Null Set is an Universal Set. That is, $\phi$' = $U$








Types of Sets



 




There are various types of sets:• Finite Set• Infinite Set• Null Set• Singleton Set• Equivalent Sets• Equal SetsFinite Set$A$ set is said to be finite if it contains only finite number of elements.Let $A$ = $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$    $B$ = $\{ a, b, c, d, e, f \}$Here, $A$ contains $5$ elements and $B$ contains $6$ elements. So, $A$ and $B$ are finite sets Examples of Finite Set• The set $\{ 2, 4, 6 \}$ Is a finite set, as it contains only $3$ elements.• If $A$ is the set of all days in a week, then $A$ is a finite set containing $7$ elements.Infinite Set$A$ set is said to be infinite if it contains an infinite number of elements.Let $C$ = {number of men living in different parts of the world} It is difficult to find the number of elements in $C$. But, it is a definite number, may be quite a big number. And so, $C$ is an infinite set.Examples of Infinite Set• The set of all even numbers is an infinite set.• The set of points on a particular straight line is an infinite set.• The sets $N$ (Natural Numbers), $Z$ (Integers), $Q$ (Rational Numbers), $R$ (Real Numbers) and $C$ (Complex Numbers) are all infinite sets, where:1) $N$ = $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ....................... \}$2) $Z$ = $\{ .............., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .......... \}$3) $Q$ = $\{$ $\frac{(p)}{(q)}$ : $p, q$ in $Z, q \notin 0 \}$4) $R$ = $\{ x : " x$ is either a rational number or an irrational number " $\}$5) $C$ = $\{ x + iy : x, y$ in $R, i$ = $\sqrt{-1} \}$Null SetA set is said to be a null set if it does not contain any element. A null set is also called as an empty set or void set. A null set is denoted by $\phi$.Therefore, $\phi$ = $\{ \}$The set $\{ 0 \}$ is not a null set, because this set contains one element "$0$".Examples of Null Set• Let $A$ = $\{ x : x\ \epsilon\ N, 2 < x <3 \}$. $A$ does not contain any element , because there is no natural number between $2$ and $3$.• Let $B$ = $\{ x : x\ \epsilon\ Q, 2 < x < 3 \}$. $B$ is not a null set, because rational numbers like $\frac{5}{2}$, $\frac{7}{3}$, $\frac{9}{4}$, $\frac{11}{5}$, ....... are all elements of the set $B$.Singleton SetA set is said to be a singleton set, if it contains only one element.Examples of the Singleton Set• The set $\{ 7 \}$ , $\{ -15 \}$ are singleton sets.• $\{ x : x + 4 = 0, x\ \epsilon\ Z \}$ is a singleton set, because this set contains only one integer namely, $-4$.Equivalent SetsTwo sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be equivalent sets if the elements of $A$ can be paired with the elements of $B$, so that each element of $A$ corresponds exactly to one element of $B$, and each element of $B$ there corresponds exactly to one element of $A$.Examples of Equivalent Sets• The sets $\{ a, b, c \}$ and $\{ 4, 7, 10 \}$ are equivalent.• The sets $\{ w, x, y, z \}$ and $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}$ are equivalent.Equal SetsTwo sets are said to be equal sets if every element of one set is in the other set and vice-versa. So, two sets are equal, if $x$ in $A \Rightarrow x$ in $B$ and $x\ \epsilon\ B \Rightarrow x\ \epsilon\ A$. If sets $A$ and $B$ are not equal, then we write $A \neq B$Examples of Equal SetsLet $A$ = $\{ x : x\ \epsilon\ N,\ 2 \leq x \leq 6 \}$ and $B$ = $\{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$ , then $A$ = $B$Let $A$ = $\{ x : x\ \epsilon\ N, 10 < x < 11 \}$ and $B$ = $\{ 10.5 \}$ , then $A \neq B$ since $10.5\ \epsilon\ A$








Cardinal Number of the Set



 




Cardinality is a measure of a size of a set or simply the total number of elements in a set. Examples of Cardinal Number of a SetCardinality of a set of vowels is 5 as it has 5 elements (a, e ,i , o, u).Cardinality of a Set of the number of months in a year is 12 as it has 12 elements (January, February, ......., December). Notation: Cardinality of a set is denoted by |A| or #A. The Cardinality of a set of natural numbers is denoted by N0 and that of the Real numbers is C.








Set Theory Examples



 




Given below are some solved examples in the set theory.Example 1: If  U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, B = (1, 3, 6, 7, 8} and C = {3, 7}, find A ∩ B, A ∪ C, B ∩ A′, B ∩ C′Solution:  U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}B = (1, 3, 6, 7, 8} C = {3, 7}A ∩ B = {6, 8} A ∪ C = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10}B ∩ A′ = {1, 3, 7}B ∩ C′ = {1, 6, 8}Example 2: If  U = {Pencil, Pen, Eraser, Notebook}, P = {Pencil, Notebook} and Q = {Pen, Eraser}, find P ∪ Q, P ∩ Q, P ∪ Q', P ∩ Q'Solution:  U = {Pencil, Pen, Eraser, Notebook}P = {Pencil, Notebook} Q = {Pen, Eraser}P ∪ Q = {Pencil, Notebook, Pen, Eraser} = UP ∩ Q = ∅P ∪ Q' = {Pen, Eraser, Pencil, Notebook}P ∩ Q' = ∅Example 3: At a breakfast buffet, 93 people preferred coffee as a beverage, 47 people preferred juice, 25 preferred both coffee and juice. If each person prefers atleast one of the beverages, then how many people visited the buffet? Solution: Let A be the set of people who prefer coffee and B be the set of people who prefer juice.n(A) = 93, n(B) = 47, n(A ∩ B) = 25 n(AUB) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A ∩ B) Plugging-in all the values,n(AUB) = 93 + 47 - 25n(AUB) = 115            Hence, the number of people who visited the buffet is 115.

Subsets



 




A Set is called as a subset of another set if all it's elements are contained in another set. The symbol used for the subset is ⊂. The set A is a subset of the set B and is expressed as A ⊂ B. Each non empty set has at least two subsets - Empty Set (or Null Set) and the set itself. The number of subsets of a set is calculated by the formula 2n, where n is the number of elements of the Set. Empty Set or Null Set is represented by either {} or Φ  (read as phi).








Proper Subset



 




A set A is said to be a proper subset of a set B, if A is a subset of B and A is not equal to B. If A is a proper subset of B, then we write A ⊂ B. If A is a proper subset of B, then B must have at least one element which is not in A.

Example:
Let B be the set of closed objects as shown below:

Let us consider the set A as follows:Then, clearly every object in A is an object in B. Hence, A ⊂ B.









Disjoint Sets



 




Two sets A and B are called disjoint sets if there is no element which is both in A and B. Disjoint sets can be also defined as those sets which do not overlap or are not duplicated. Let us consider two sets as follows:

Let A be the set of triangles as shown                           Let B be the set of arrows as shownHere, the set A and B have no elements in common. So, A ∩ B = Φ. Hence, such sets are called as disjoint sets.

Example
The set of intervals { [1, 3], [2,5], (7,9)} is not disjoint, since [1, 3] is overlapping [2,5]. Disjoint sets are also said to be mutually exclusive or independent. 

Disjoint sets can be represented by using venn-diagram as:
Mutually Disjoint Sets

Set A1, A2, A3, ......, An are mutually disjoint if Ai ∩ Aj = Φ for i ≠  j. A partition of set A is a collection of subsets Ai of A such that Ai ≠  Φ , A1, A2, A3, .........., An are mutually disjoint and ∪ Ai = A 

For example, let the universal set be U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
and let its subsets be A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}.
Then, A ∩ B = Φ and A ∪ B = U. So, A and B are partitions of U

ABOUT US


All Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™ products and services center on delivery of and/or financial support for the integration of medical and behavioral health services in medical settings, especially for comorbid medical patients with treatment resistance and high health costs.  Since financing and delivery go hand in hand, many Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™ clients capitalize on its expertise in both areas so that, to the extent possible, recommended integrated value-added services are financially sustainable.
Incorporated in 1997, Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™ has nearly 20 years experience consulting to diverse clients, including businesses, state and federal government agencies, health plans, and accountable provider systems (hospitals, clinics, and health professionals) that are responsible for health and cost outcomes of constituent populations.   Its services began largely as an outgrowth of the integrated clinical care that Dr. Kathol, founder and President of Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™, provided during 22 years of practice at the University of Iowa.  Initial consultations were designed to assist hospitals and clinics set up integrated inpatient and outpatient programs that improved health and reduced cost (added value) in their medical settings.
Between 2000 and 2003, Dr. Kathol was hired to integrate medical and behavioral health business practices at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSMN). After completing that assignment in 2003, Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™ expanded its client base and service offerings to include integration services and products for government agencies, businesses, and health plans. Knowledge gained from the perspective of purchasers (government agencies and businesses) and those that paid for the care delivered (government agencies and health plans) while working for the insurance industry clarified the important contribution that financing for care has on the ability to deliver and economically sustain medical and behavioral health integration.
While working for BCBSMN, Dr. Kathol also developed an appreciation for the value that assist and support services (case management, wellness programs, etc.) could add to standard clinical care.  Thus, between 2003 and 2008, he linked his expertise

In integrated care financing and delivery,
In value-added features of assist and support services, and
In findings from health complexity research performed by academic colleagues in Europe

by co-authoring The Integrated Case Management (ICM) Manual (Springer Publ, 2010).  Since 2010, more than a thousand case managers have received adult and/or pediatric ICM training using this text and over 10 regional and national organizations have deployed health improving and cost saving components inherent in core ICM principles and practices.  Drs. Kathol, Hobbs-Knutson, and Dehnel will soon publish a complementary text, Physician’s Guide: Understanding and Working with Integrated Case Managers, (Springer, 2016) which will be used to train clinicians in maximizing the value that ICM mangers bring to their patients.
Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™ has experienced an increase in interest in its unique high intensity integrated care products and services since passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  Recent findings by Milliman, Inc. indicate that the financial impact from the interaction of behavioral and medical conditions, especially in the medical setting, accounts for a third of the total health budget (see Table).  Whether clients are businesses, government agencies, health plans, or accountable provider systems, all contribute to the now indisputable poor health outcomes and substantially higher costs associated with ineffectively addressed behavioral health care in medical settings.  All also wish to capitalize on the potential for savings in their segment of the health care industry by incorporating new, previously unconsidered, changes in core business practices related to the delivery of or financing for value-added behavioral health services in medical settings. Cartesian Solutions, Inc.™  provides the expertise to accomplish this task.

Cartesian Product




The Cartesian product of two sets  and  (also called the
 product set, set direct product, or cross product) is defined to be the set of all
 points  where  and . It is denoted , and is
 called the Cartesian product since it originated in Descartes' formulation of analytic
 geometry. In the Cartesian view, points in the plane are specified by their vertical
 and horizontal coordinates, with points on a line being specified by just one coordinate.
 The main examples of direct products are Euclidean
 three-space (, where  are the real
 numbers), and the plane ().


The graph product is sometimes called the Cartesian
product (Vizing 1963, Clark and Suen 2000).

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a

A
 

 and 

 
b

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A
×
(
B
∩
C
)
=
(
A
×
B
)
∩
(
A

,


{\displaystyle A\times (B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap (A\times C),}

.


{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

[5]

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A

(
B

)
=
(
A

)
∩

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

 of the sets

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(

×
(

=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪

)
×
(
C

)
≠
(
A

C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)

∪
[
(

)
×
(

]
∪
[
(

∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]

{\displaystyle {\text{if both }}A,B\neq \emptyset {\text{ then }}A\times B\subseteq C\times D\iff A\subseteq C\land B\subseteq D.}

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

 of the sets 




A

In set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.





A
×
B
=
{

(
a
,
b
)
∣
a
∈
A
 

 and 

 
b
∈
B

}
.


{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}

[1]

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value).
More generally, a Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of n dimensions, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.
The Cartesian product is named after René Descartes,[2] whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.

Examples[edit]
A deck of cards[edit]




Standard 52-card deck


An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards.
Ranks × Suits returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, ♥), (A, ♦), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, ♥), (2, ♦), (2, ♣)}.
Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.
A two-dimensional coordinate system[edit]




Cartesian coordinates of example points


The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively; cf. picture. The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product ℝ×ℝ with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.
Most common implementation (set theory)[edit]
Main article: Implementation of mathematics in set theory
A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is 



(
x
,
y
)
=
{
{
x
}
,
{
x
,
y
}
}


{\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}}

. Note that, under this definition, 



X
×
Y
⊆


P


(


P


(
X
∪
Y
)
)


{\displaystyle X\times Y\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X\cup Y))}

, where 





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

 represents the power set. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.
Non-commutativity and non-associativity[edit]
Let A, B, C, and D be sets.
The Cartesian product A × B is not commutative,





A
×
B
≠
B
×
A
,


{\displaystyle A\times B\neq B\times A,}



because the ordered pairs are reversed except if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:[3]

A is equal to B, or
A or B is the empty set.

For example:

A = {1,2}; B = {3,4}

A × B = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
B × A = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}




A = B = {1,2}

A × B = B × A = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}




A = {1,2}; B = ∅

A × B = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
B × A = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅




Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).





(
A
×
B
)
×
C
≠
A
×
(
B
×
C
)


{\displaystyle (A\times B)\times C\neq A\times (B\times C)}



If for example A = {1}, then (A × A) × A = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = A × (A × A).
Intersections, unions, and subsets[edit]







Example sets A={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤4},
B={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, and C={x∈ℝ:4≤x≤7}, demonstrating
A×(B∩C) = (A×B)∩(A×C),
A×(B∪C) = (A×B)∪(A×C), and
A×(B \ C) = (A×B) \ (A×C).












(A∪B)×(C∪D) ≠ (A×C)∪(B×D) can be seen from the same example.












Example sets
A={x∈ℝ:2≤x≤5}, B={x∈ℝ:3≤x≤7},
C={y∈ℝ:1≤y≤3}, D={y∈ℝ:2≤y≤4}, demonstrating
(A∩B)×(C∩D) = (A×C)∩(B×D).





The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections, cf. left picture.





(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∩
D
)
=
(
A
×
C
)
∩
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cap B)\times (C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap (B\times D)}

[4]

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union, cf. middle picture.





(
A
∪
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
≠
(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)


{\displaystyle (A\cup B)\times (C\cup D)\neq (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)}



In fact, we have that:





(
A
×
C
)
∪
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]
∪
[
(
A
∩
B
)
×
(
C
∪
D
)
]
∪
[
(
B
∖
A
)
×
D
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\cup (B\times D)=[(A\setminus B)\times C]\cup [(A\cap B)\times (C\cup D)]\cup [(B\setminus A)\times D]}



For the set difference we also have the following identity:





(
A
×
C
)
∖
(
B
×
D
)
=
[
A
×
(
C
∖
D
)
]
∪
[
(
A
∖
B
)
×
C
]


{\displaystyle (A\times C)\setminus (B\times D)=[A\times (C\setminus D)]\cup [(A\setminus B)\times C]}



Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (cf. right picture):[3]





A

(
B

)
=
(

Cardinality[edit]
See also: Cardinal arithmetic
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: A = {a, b} and B = {5, 6}. Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as A × B, results in a new set which has the following elements:

A × B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of A is paired with each element of B. Each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,

|A × B| = |A| · |B|.

Similarly

|A × B × C| = |A| · |B| · |C|

and so on.
The set A × B is infinite if either A or B is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.[6]
n-ary product[edit]
Cartesian power[edit]
The Cartesian square (or binary Cartesian product) of a set X is the Cartesian product X2 = X × X. An example is the 2-dimensional plane R2 = R × R where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points (x,y) where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).
The cartesian power of a set X can be defined as:






X

n


=




X
×
X
×
⋯
×
X

⏟



n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
 

|

 

x

i


∈
X

 for all 

i
=
1
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle X^{n}=\underbrace {X\times X\times \cdots \times X} _{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\ |\ x_{i}\in X{\text{ for all }}i=1,\ldots ,n\}.}



An example of this is R3 = R × R × R, with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn.
The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.
Finite n-ary product[edit]
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn:






X

1


×
⋯
×

X

n


=
{
(

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


)
:

x

i


∈

X

i


}
.


{\displaystyle X_{1}\times \cdots \times X_{n}=\{(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}):x_{i}\in X_{i}\}.}



It is a set of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified to (X1 × ... × Xn−1) × Xn.
Infinite products[edit]
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and 



{

X

i



}

i
∈
I




{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}}

 is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in X is defined to be






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

{


f
:
I
→

⋃

i
∈
I



X

i


 
|

 
(
∀
i
)
(
f
(
i
)
∈

X

i


)
}

,


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\left\{\left.f:I\to \bigcup _{i\in I}X_{i}\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i)\in X_{i})\right\},}



that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.
For each j in I, the function






π

j


:

∏

i
∈
I



X

i


→

X

j


,


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}:\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}\to X_{j},}



defined by 




π

j


(
f
)
=
f
(
j
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{j}(f)=f(j)}

 is called the jth projection map.
An important case is when the index set is 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of






∏

n
=
1


∞



R

=

R

×

R

×
⋯


{\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} \times \cdots }



can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted 





R


ω




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\omega }}

, or 





R



N





{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\mathbb {N} }}

.
The special case Cartesian exponentiation occurs when all the factors Xi involved in the product are the same set X. In this case,






∏

i
∈
I



X

i


=

∏

i
∈
I


X


{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}=\prod _{i\in I}X}



is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation.
The definition of finite Cartesian products can be seen as a special case of the definition for infinite products. In this interpretation, an n-tuple can be viewed as a function on {1, 2, ..., n} that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple (in some settings, this is taken as the very definition of an n-tuple).
Other forms[edit]
Abbreviated form[edit]
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. X1, X2, X3, …, then some authors[7] choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×Xi.
Cartesian product of functions[edit]
If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, their Cartesian product f × g is a function from A × X to B × Y with





(
f
×
g
)
(
a
,
x
)
=
(
f
(
a
)
,
g
(
x
)
)
.


{\displaystyle (f\times g)(a,x)=(f(a),g(x)).}



This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. Note that this is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.
Cylinder[edit]
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a set and 



B
⊆
A


{\displaystyle B\subseteq A}

. Then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 with respect to 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is the Cartesian product 



B
×
A


{\displaystyle B\times A}

 of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
Normally, 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a subset of the natural numbers 




N



{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }

, then the cylinder of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is 



B
×

N



{\displaystyle B\times \mathbb {N} }

.
Definitions outside of set theory[edit]
Category theory[edit]
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.
Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.
Graph theory[edit]
In graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by G × H whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u′,v′) are adjacent in G × H if and only if u = u′ and v is adjacent with v′ in H, or v = v′ and u is adjacent with u′ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.
