Cardiovascular Systems Expands Product Portfolio

Company to Sell Invatec Balloon Catheters in the United States ViperSheath(TM) Introducer Sheath LaunchedST. PAUL, Minn., Apr 08, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) (Nasdaq:CSII), a medical device
company developing and commercializing innovative interventional
treatment systems for vascular disease, has expanded its product
portfolio by signing an agreement with Invatec, a comprehensive provider
of interventional products, to market Invatec's PTA balloon catheter
line in the United States. CSI is also launching the newest addition to
its Viper line of supplemental products, the ViperSheath(TM) Introducer
Sheath.
CSI's flagship product is the Diamondback 360o(TM) Orbital
Atherectomy System, a minimally invasive catheter system for treating
peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Between 8 and 12 million Americans
suffer from PAD, which is caused by the accumulation of plaque in leg or
foot arteries, reducing blood flow. Symptoms include leg pain when
walking or at rest, and PAD can lead to tissue loss and eventually limb
amputation. The Diamondback 360o is highly effective in
removing plaque and restoring blood flow in vessels both below and above
the knee. In some cases, balloon angioplasty may also be used to achieve
the desired vessel diameter after removing plaque with the Diamondback
360o.

"CSI is committed to developing and offering products specifically
designed to treat PAD and to prevent the trauma and costs associated
with limb amputation," said David L. Martin, CSI president and chief
executive officer. "The innovative Invatec products and Viper line of
supplemental products, including the new ViperSheath, complement and
expand our product portfolio, as well as enhance the productivity of our
national sales team. These product additions are in line with our
mission to provide physicians with the tools they need to treat PAD."

CSI will offer the Invatec balloon catheter line, including the
SubMarine Plus(TM) PTA Balloon Catheter, the Admiral Xtreme(TM) PTA Balloon
Catheter and the Amphirion Deep(TM) PTA Balloon Catheter.

Dr. Ray Dattilo, director of peripheral interventions at St. Francis
Hospital, Topeka, Kansas, said, "The large diseased vessels above the
knee will often become damaged when ballooned, if they are not first
made more compliant with Diamondback 360o treatment. We find
the Invatec balloons expand with far less pressure after the vessel is
treated with the Diamondback 360o, avoiding both dissection
and the need to stent."

"The extensive reach of CSI's sales and marketing team will enable us to
fully capitalize on the significant market interest in Invatec's balloon
catheter line," said Jack Springer, president of Invatec USA. "CSI is
the ideal partner for us, as it shares our belief in working closely
with our physician community to develop endovascular tools that help
improve the outcomes of their patients and enhance the quality of their
lives."

CSI Expands Product Portfolio with ViperSheath(TM) Launch

Additionally, CSI is launching ViperSheath, an introducer sheath
providing a smooth, pliable solution for vessel access. A tapered soft
tip means low insertion force and minimal trauma on vessel walls during
insertion. A kink- and crush-resistant catheter allows for optimal
crossability and easy navigation of tortuous vessels. ViperSheath joins
a portfolio of existing CSI supplemental products including: ViperSlide(TM)
- an exclusive lubrication designed to optimize the smooth operation of
the Diamondback 360; ViperTrack(TM) - a radiopaque tape designed to assist
in identifying lesion lengths and the best treatment strategy for
procedures using fluoroscopic or radiographic imaging, and ViperWire(TM) a
spring tip guidewire with flexible or firm stiffness profiles,
specifically designed for the Diamondback 360(TM) to achieve maximum
performance. All products are available through the CSI national sales
organization.

About Cardiovascular Systems Inc.

Cardiovascular Systems Inc. is a medical device company focused on
developing and commercializing interventional treatment systems for
vascular disease. The company's Diamondback 360° Orbital Atherectomy
System is capable of treating a broad range of plaque types both above
and below the knee, including calcified vessel lesions, and addresses
many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives.
In August 2007, the U.S. FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the use of the
Diamondback 360° as a therapy for PAD (peripheral arterial disease), and
CSI commenced a U.S. product launch in September 2007. The Diamondback
360° system has been adopted by more than 400 hospitals across the
United States. For more information visit the company's Web site at www.csi360.com.

Cardiovascular Systems Inc.: The Best Medical Device Companies of 2013
A new coronary indication opens up a new market for Cardiovascular Systems' (CSII) devices with profit making implications.











                Todd Campbell
            

                (TMFEBCapital)



            
            Jan 7, 2014 at 3:47PM
            
            





With the S&P Healthcare Equipment Select Industry Index up 32% this past year, it's clear that the industry performed well in 2013 -- but which stocks were the biggest winners? Some of the best performers outpaced the index significantly last year, and, in this series, I review five of the biggest movers.
Dexcom was the first in this series and I outlined the key reasons behind its doubling in an article last week. Today, I dig into the second stock in this series, Cardiovascular Systems, (NASDAQ:CSII) a maker of systems used in treating narrowing arteries in the leg. Excitement over the company's latest generation devices helped drive shares up more than 150% last year.

CSII Total Return Price data by YCharts.
An opportunity opens in treating PADCardiovascular Systems has been around since 1989, but it wasn't until it launched its latest generation of systems for peripheral artery disease, or PAD, that investors really took notice.
The devices help surgeons more effectively treat the build up of plaque in leg arteries. A lack of blood flow means patients suffer pain when walking, significantly affecting the patient's quality of life. Patients can successfully improve their condition by quitting smoking, eating better, and exercising, but for those with more advanced cases surgery is likely.





In those cases, a common approach is angioplasty, a procedure in which a catheter is used to reach the blockage in the artery and a balloon attached to the catheter is inflated to flatten the blockage. Sometimes a bare metal, coated, or drug eluting stent is also inserted to help keep the artery open.
Those catheters and stents are sold by big medical device players like Abbott (NYSE: ABT) and Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (NYSE:JNJ) and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT).
Abbott bolstered its position in PAD stents with the acquisition of Idev last July and has about a quarter of the broader vascular market, according to Trefis.  Idev's Supera Veritas stent system has been sold in the EU since 2010 and the company has filed for FDA approval for use in the main artery of the thigh. 
And J&J's Cordis bought PAD stent developer Flexible Stenting Solutions in March, 2013. That deal boosted Cordis PAD product line, including the S.M.A.R.T. stent, which has received the FDA nod for use in arteries both above and at the knee.





Not to be left out, Medtronic won FDA approval in September for use of its Complete SE stent in those two arteries too.  Medtronic is also studying the use of a drug-eluting balloon in PAD procedures. 
The interest in building up product lines addressing PAD is tied to its widespread prevalence. The risk of developing PAD climbs steadily through your 50s, 60s, and 70s, and more than 25% of men older than age 80 develop the condition. Overall, PAD affects 12% to 20% of Americans over the age of 65 and as many as 200 million people worldwide.  

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Spinning its way to successCardiovascular's 360 PAD devices help reduce the inflation pressure of balloons used in angioplasty by removing more of the calcium buildup along the vascular wall. That calcium buildup occurs in between 60% and 80% of all PAD patients. The device removes the calcium by using an orbital spin to break the buildup down into particles smaller than blood cells.





The approach has been used to treat above and below the knee buildup in more than 3,700 patients during clinical trials and more than 125.000 devices have been sold since winning approval from the FDA in 2007. That number is expected to climb following an approval for the use of the company's orbital approach in coronary arteries last October.  It's estimated that calcium buildup occurs in about 40% of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. 
Since estimates peg the coronary procedure market at $1.5 billion a year, investors appear willing to accept dilution.  To advance the device's use in coronary patients, the company raised nearly $85 million in a public stock offering in November.
The coronary market opportunity could prove significant given the company's sales, which climbed 28% year-over-year, were just $29.8 million last quarter. Cardiovascular expects sales in its fiscal second quarter ending December to grow 19% to 22% to $31 million.
Fool-worthy final thoughtsTrial costs and pre-coronary launch expenses pushed the company to a $7 million loss last quarter and the company is guiding for a loss of $9 million in fiscal Q2. But margins are healthy at 77%, suggesting uptake in the coronary indication may present profit opportunity over the coming years as higher unit volume is leveraged against fixed costs. Since the coronary indication could be so significant to the company's quest for profit, investors should keep a close eye on the company to see if the device gains traction for the indication this year.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
