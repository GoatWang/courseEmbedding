Thomas Bene to set up own consultancy
Thomas Bene, of the Bene furniture company, is to launch his own branding and design consultancy.

3:47 pm



At the Bene Group’s annual general meeting on 9 June, Bene announced that he is giving up his position as member of the management board responsible for marketing and portfolio.
On 1 August he is to launch a new consultancy, which he says will carry out traditional design services such as consultancy, marketing and brand development, as well as ‘establish a platform for design, interior design and architecture’.
Bene says, ‘Through intensive contacts and my broad network in such sectors as interiors, fashion, art, music and entertainment, I have always been personally dedicated to projects that go beyond the horizons of the office furniture industry. That’s why I’ve been pursuing the desire to enhance my professional life with new stimuli from other creative industries.’
Bene, who has been with the group for 17 years, says, ‘Bene furniture is picking up steam again after two turbulent years and the marketing and portfolio department is on solid footing. In recent years I have built up a team that works independently and self-sufficiently, offering me an excellent opportunity to pursue new challenges.’
