S&P Lowers Ratings of Allied World After Acquisition by Fairfax; Outlook Stable

July 10, 2017

Article
Comments


S&P Global Ratings lowered its long-term counterparty credit and senior debt ratings on Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings AG to ‘BBB-‘ from ‘BBB+’, following the completion of the company’s acquisition last week by Fairfax Financial Holdings.
At the same time, S&P lowered its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on Allied World’s operating companies to ‘A-‘ from ‘A’. The outlook on all these companies is stable.
“We lowered the ratings on Allied World and aligned them with those on Fairfax, as we now view Allied World as a strategically important entity to Fairfax based on its material size and strategic fit within the expanded group,” said S&P, explaining that the ratings and outlook on Allied World will now move in tandem with those on Fairfax.
“The acquisition of Allied World brings a strongly performing re/insurance group under the Fairfax umbrella, but as with other Fairfax re/insurance subsidiaries, Allied World will continue to operate independently – with no anticipated revenue or expense synergies,” S&P added.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
