The Mechanics of AngelList Syndicates – Hacker NoonFollowSign in / Sign upDavid E. WeeklyBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSr. Product Manager at Google, ex-Facebook. Started: Drone.VC, Mexican.VC, Neuron.VC, PBwiki, DevHouse, and Hacker Dojo. Startup advisor. Chopper pilot. Dad. ❤�Jul 19, 2016The Mechanics of AngelList Syndicatesfor Investors & Startups, by David E. Weekly, written mid-2016Hi! I help run two separate syndicates on AngelList; drone.vc (focused on drone tech) and neuron.vc (focused on applied deep learning). Many people are unfamiliar with how AngelList Syndicates work — what makes them similar and different to working with either individual angels, an “angel group”, or working with a traditional venture capital institution. This guide hopes to clarify that for you. If you’d like a basic primer in startup stocks and the like, I’d recommend my free Guide to Stocks & Options as a resource.Disclaimers Galore: I’m not a lawyer. None of the below should be constituted as legal or tax advice, for which you should seek the services of a licensed professional. The below was written with US investors investing in US-incorporated technology startups: rules, restrictions, and considerations may vary considerably from the below advice for other geographies. I don’t work for or represent AngelList and may have materially misrepresented their program. Investing in startups is dangerous. Also, don’t run with scissors.Angels“Angels” are what we call people who invest their own money. The SEC puts restrictions around what kind of investments people can make if they’re not rich yet — to keep, say, grandparents from getting tricked out of their retirement savings by a huckster — so most angels need to be rich by the SEC’s bar. If you meet this bar, the SEC will consider you an accredited investor. These definitions haven’t changed in a while, but when we talk angels, we’re not talking institutions, we’re talking individuals — humans. With motivations. And there are good and bad motivations to being an angel.The first thing an investor should ask themselves is what they’re hoping to get out of their investments. If an angel is hoping to “get rich quick”, “help steer an early stage company” or even “get a front row seat into a company’s operations” by angel investing, they’re may well be disappointed with the process. Angels very rarely get special rights, like a Board seat or even observer rights. Angels that try to too aggressively interfere with a company’s operations get a bad name, and for good reason — you’ll likely hurt more than you’ll help.Good angels often have a broad portfolio of companies and act as a passive “service provider”, helping startups when they ask for it. Ron Conway, the “godfather” of Silicon Valley, pioneered this approach, meeting with huge numbers of companies, making quick decisions about investment, investing in a very large number of companies, and generally not asking for control/observation — there was just no way he’d have the time to sit on that many boards! While some derided this as “spray & pray” and prefer to see investment as “smart money” where companies receive both capital and active advice, Ron’s returns speak for themselves. Ron can get access to pretty much any deal because Ron has removed every reasonable objection you might have to taking his money. The returns you’ll realize are going to map to whether you are able to get in on the best deals, likely ones where lots of other investors are vying for entry to the deal as well. If you establish a reputation for being helpful and easy to work with, you make it easier to get in on any deal you want.Now lest I frame passive investors too passively, Ron would move mountains for a portfolio company that had a specific ask of him — even if you’d need to spend the first thirty seconds on a phone call reminding him that you were CEO of a company he invested in. ;) I’ll disclaim that Ron invested in my first company, PBwiki, and was a wonderful supporter.The portfolio approach is important from a returns perspective. It can be very difficult to predict which companies will do really well and which will flounder. A humble “black swan” style approach is for an investor to admit they’re probably going to get this wrong a lot and so to have a wide range of bets in the hope that one will be a breakout hit. Investor returns are typically on an extreme power law curve — if one company does really well, it will do so well that it literally won’t matter what happened with any other company in your portfolio. So a good angel investor will seek to build to a portfolio of e.g. 30+ startups. Your probabilistic returns are much higher to make thirty $10k investments versus one $300k investment. Put another way, if your only involvement in angel investment is writing one check, you’re probably going to be disappointed with the outcome and conclude that angel investing isn’t for you. Pace yourself! Allocate a certain yearly budget for investment and seek to regularly make small bets.Another good reason to be an angel investor is that you like meeting with founders, who can teach you about new industries, emerging best practices, and clever approaches to problem solving and teambuilding. Founder energy is fun and infectious and can inspire you.Finally, it’s great to give back. A lot of people in Silicon Valley (maybe most of them!) made it big when others “took a bet” on them and thus they want to “pay it forward” by blessing newcomers with capital, advice, and networking. This is one of the most powerful and poorly held secrets of Silicon Valley; I attribute it to the area’s hippy history. :-)SyndicatesAngelList, a privately-held company in SF, offers a wide range of services to enable companies, individuals, and angels to connect. Startups can post jobs available, angels can seek companies to invest in, and companies can seek funding. One of the features AngelList has added in the past few years is the ability for an individual well-connected angel to create a syndicate to allow other angels access to deals the lead is participating in, on the same terms. Angel participants can “soft commit” to seriously consider funding companies alongside these influential angels. This has interesting follow-on effects: startups now have more motivation to meet with these “super angel” syndicate leads since they represent a collective of investors, which means these syndicates get more and better deal flow than they would as an unorganized group of individual investors. Over time, the size of such a syndicate may give an individual angel decision-making power equivalent to a traditional small venture capital firm with almost none of the typical investment overhead of a fund. Let’s walk through the math.If I wanted to be a syndicate lead, I’d announce “I’m planning on investing $10,000 of my own money in 3–4 companies a year”. I might find thirty friends who are each willing to tentatively commit to putting in $10,000 of their own money into such deals on the same terms as me. Now I’ve got $10k of my own money with $300k of other people’s money that I can offer for investment in a company. This obviously makes it much more interesting for a company to meet with me versus if I could have only cut them a $10k check. For those of you paying attention, you’ll note that the $300k is only tentatively committed. In reality, only ~60% of syndicate backers will actually close on a deal. So with $300k in syndicate backing, I can reasonably expect to offer $180k in funding to a company.When the syndicate lead finds a specific deal that they’re excited about, they agree on the terms of investment with the startup (“leading” the deal) or they join other investors who are investing in the company at the same time, on the same terms (“following”). They indicate the deal to AngelList, which triggers some AL folks reaching out to both the syndicate lead and startup to confirm terms and help the startup get their AngelList page into proper shape to “launch” the deal. Once the deal has been approved for launch by AngelList, it’s up to the syndicate lead to publicize.The lead then writes up why they were interested in this particular company and shares those thoughts and data confidentially with syndicate participants. Participating angels in the syndicate can then review the deal and decide if they would like to opt-in to the deal. An individual syndicate deal can only have up to 99 accredited investors participate; if 100 or more investors want to join, it will be up to the syndicate lead who they want to allow into the deal. Typically investors who choose to “pre-fund” their syndicate participation are first in line; these investors have to actively opt-out of deals. They’re followed by investors willing to invest larger amounts, e.g. $10k vs $5k, then everyone else.With the deal launched, AngelList sets up an escrow into which syndicate participants can ACH transfer or wire their funds, and collects electronic signatures from the startup, syndicate lead, and syndicate participants. AngelList charges a fixed $8k for the deal to manage all of the backoffice. So if in the above example there was a $180k syndicate raise, $8k of that would get paid to AngelList and $172k would be wired to the startup. AngelList creates a new Delaware LLC as a single-purpose corporate vehicle to make and manage the investment. The name of this LLC is typically a jumbled combo of the name of the syndicate and the name of the startup being invested in; in the case of drone.vc’s investment in PRENAV, for instance, the entity created was called “AngelList-Prav-Fund, a series of AngelList-DrVc-Funds, LLC”. Yeah, that’s a mouthful. To make things even more fun, AngelList actually outsources the management of these LLCs to a company called Assure Fund Management.From the startup’s perspective it’s pretty good, since they only get two new shareholders on their cap table; the syndicate lead, who makes their investment directly as an individual, and the LLC. So PRENAV got “David E. Weekly” as a shareholder as well as the above mouthful of an LLC. Because there is meaningful ongoing backoffice work that needs to be done for every shareholder a company has, minimizing cap table entries is a great time and money saver for startups.Most of the deals I see use pretty vanilla terms: a Series Seed (equity), a SAFE note, or otherwise templated convertible notes (debt) with a clear cap and discount. I’ve heard a few stories of early stage investors being pretty badly abused with a SAFE note, so I’m gently nudging people towards using Series Seed, since it’s pretty easy for the startup and offers investors the safety of actual equity.The deal is only live for a fixed period of time, typically 20-30 days. This gives the lead enough time to discuss the deal with participants, gives investors a chance to ask questions (or come back from vacation!) and to wire their money in. I’ll note that for most deals, you’ll know within four days of launch about how well the deal will do. Here below are three real deals I closed with drone.vc. Note that committed capital can dip week to week if a prefunded investor chooses to opt out.Something to be aware of: AngelList has syndicate amplification funds like Maiden Lane and CSC Upshot that can further financially amplify a syndicated deal with significant traction. Typically these funds will make a go/no-go decision on investment in a few days. They are looking for deals that have strong “signal”, meaning several notable investors or firms are already participating in the deal beyond the syndicate. So a deal led by a syndicate with only syndicate members participating is unlikely to be able to access these funds. If the fund does decide to participate in a deal, they’ll come in at the same terms, through the syndicate vehicle.If you’re a syndicate lead, you’ll need to not only hype a company but also candidly disclose potential risks. It’s really important to do this thoroughly; if it can be shown that you knew about certain material risks to a startup’s success and didn’t disclose them to fellow investors, you could end up in hot water. Finally, you’ll need to disclose any variations — if the startup is actually run by your brother, if you have been given advisory shares, if you’re already a shareholder, if you’re getting a different deal than syndicate participants, etc. Needless to say, it’s best if your deal has no variations.CarrySo far, so good, but you might ask what’s in it for the syndicate lead other than getting better deal exposure and getting to help their friends? A syndicate lead isn’t paid a penny of the $8k that goes to AngelList. Indeed, the only movement regarding their bank account is the outbound money being invested in the startup!The payout to a syndicate lead happens when a company invested in by the syndicate has a liquidity event (e.g. someone buys the company or the company goes public). At this point, the shares held by the LLC get exchanged for cash. The cash that investors put in is returned to them and money returned to the LLC beyond funds invested is then called carry, which is basically the profit off of the investment. Of the carry, AngelList takes 5% and typically syndicate leads take around 15%. The total amount, e.g. 20%, is listed clearly on a syndicate’s page when investors sign up to the syndicate or a syndicated deal.Thanks for reading this guide to AngelList Syndicates! Let me know if it was useful to you and/or what I got wrong at david@weekly.org. Finally, if you’re an accredited investor in interested in drones, I’d love to welcome you to my drone.vc syndicate; if into deep learning, neuron.vc.HN DiscussionHacker Noon is how hackers start their afternoons.

IN THE MATTER OF THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF ONTARIO (the "Jurisdiction") AND IN THE MATTER OF ANGELLIST, LLC ("AngelList") and ANGELLIST ADVISORS, LLC ("ALA", collectively with AngelList, the "Filers")
DECISION
Background
The Ontario Securities Commission (Commission) has established a pilot program (OSC LaunchPad) to assist innovative businesses, particularly financial technology (fintech) and start-up companies, understand the securities regulatory environment, how the regulatory framework applies, and how to register their businesses in Ontario. The Commission recognizes that to keep abreast of and facilitate innovation, an environment to test novel business models, products and services is required. Additionally, the Commission also recognizes that some new businesses may have limited experience in dealing with securities regulators. In working with these types of businesses, OSC LaunchPad allows for a flexible approach to addressing regulatory requirements applicable for these businesses while ensuring appropriate investor protection.
The Filers have been engaged in discussions with the Commission about becoming registered for a test period of two years in light of the novel nature of their business. The Filers operate an online platform that offers a number of services to start-up businesses that operate primarily in the technology sector (Start-ups), including services to facilitate venture capital and angel investing in Start-ups that meet certain criteria. The Filers offers these services through a business model that reflects the business requirements of the venture capital and angel investing community it serves. An investor must actively seek to join the Filers' platform and, in addition to being an accredited investor (as defined in section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)), must also have prior experience in venture capital and angel investing, such that they have an understanding of the risks of investing in Start-ups, through the platform. The Filers do not hold or handle money or assets of investors or Start-ups. AngelList is responsible for operating the online platform and ALA facilitates the syndication of offerings through the platform.
Pursuant to the OSC LaunchPad initiative, the Filers have approached the Commission regarding the registration of ALA as a restricted dealer. In conjunction with ALA's application for registration, ALA is seeking relief from certain requirements under securities legislation of the Jurisdiction. This decision (the Decision) should not be viewed as a precedent for other filers in Ontario or in other jurisdictions.
Relief from registrant obligations
1. The Filers have applied for a decision of the Director under the securities legislation of the Jurisdiction (the Legislation) pursuant to section 15.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations (NI 31-103) for exemptive relief for ALA from the following:

(a) the requirement in subsection 12.10(2) [Audited financial statements] of NI 31-103 that the annual financial statements delivered to the regulator must be audited (the audited financial statement requirement);
(b) the requirement in subparagraph 13.2(2)(c)(i) [Know-your-client] of NI 31-103 that a registrant must take reasonable steps to ensure that it has sufficient information regarding the client's investment needs and objectives (the know-your-client requirement);
(c) the requirement in section 13.3. [Suitability] of NI 31-103 that a registrant must take reasonable steps to ensure that, before it makes a recommendation to or accepts an instruction from a client to buy or sell a security, the purchase or sale is suitable for the client (the suitability requirement);
(d) the requirement in section 13.16 of NI 31-103 [dispute resolution service] that a registered firm have a certain dispute resolution service provider (the dispute resolution requirements); and
(e) the requirement to deliver the disclosure and reporting requirements in paragraphs 14.2(2)(i), (j), and (k) [Relationship Disclosure Information] and 5 [Reporting to clients] of Part 14 of NI 31-103 (the disclosure and reporting requirements) (together with the preceding paragraphs, referred to as the Registrant Obligations Relief Sought),

provided that ALA ensures only Quality Investors (as defined below) access the Restricted Services (as defined below) and registration is limited to two years from the date of this Decision.
Prospectus Relief
2. ALA has applied for a ruling of the Commission pursuant to section 74(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario) (the Act) for exemptive relief from the prospectus requirement set forth in section 53 of the Act in connection with distributions by ALA to Quality Investors (as defined below) who acquire securities of syndicates through the platform (as described in this Decision) (the Prospectus Relief Sought).

2. Terms used in this Decision that are defined in the Act or National Instrument 14-101 Definitions (NI 14-101), and not otherwise defined in the Decision, shall have the same meaning as in the Act or NI 14-101, as applicable, unless the context otherwise requires.
Representations
This Decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filers:

The Filers
3. ALA has applied for registration as a restricted dealer in Ontario pursuant to section 25(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario) (the Act) and NI 31-103.
4. ALA is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the state of Delaware. ALA is a subsidiary of AngelList, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the state of Delaware. A minority interest in ALA is held by AngelList EI, LLC (which is wholly-owned by employees of ALA or ALA's affiliates). The head offices of the Filers are in San Francisco, California, United States of America.
5. ALA is an "exempt reporting adviser" in the U.S. ALA relies on an exemption from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investment adviser registration requirements under sections 203(l) [venture capital fund adviser exemption] of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related rules. As an exempt reporting adviser, ALA is subject to oversight by the SEC, including the requirement to pay fees to the SEC, to report annually certain information to the SEC and to have policies regarding the dissemination of material, non-public information and anti-fraud measures. ALA is also subject to review by the SEC.
6. The Filers are not registered as broker-dealers with the SEC under U.S. federal securities laws. The Filers rely on a no action letter issued to them by the SEC dated March 28, 2013 regarding the scope of their permitted activities in the U.S. without registering as broker-dealers in accordance with section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Filers also rely on the no action letter issued to FundersClub Inc. and FundersClub Management LLC by the SEC dated March 26, 2013 with respect to their activities as an exempt reporting adviser. The Filers also rely on section 201(c) of the JOBS Act.
7. AngelList Ltd., an affiliate of the Filers, is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority to carry on the following limited regulated activities in the United Kingdom: arranging (bringing about) deals in investments, dealing in investments as agent, and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments. Through a passport process, AngelList Ltd. is permitted to carry out its permitted activities to countries in the European Economic Area.
8. The Filers wish to offer certain of the services (as described below) to issuers and investors in Ontario. As these services will involve the facilitation of trades in securities of issuers to Quality Investors for the purposes of venture capital and angel investing, ALA wishes to become registered as a restricted dealer in accordance with Ontario securities law. As the Filers' business model is novel in Canada, ALA's registration will be for an initial test period of two years.
9. Although the Filers are initially seeking registration and relief from certain registrant obligations and prospectus requirements in Ontario, the Filers may, at a later date, propose to allow Quality Investors and issuers resident in other Canadian jurisdictions to access the Restricted Services (as defined below). Prior to allowing Quality Investors and issuers in another Canadian jurisdiction to access the Restricted Services, the Filers will apply for and obtain registration as a restricted dealer in that jurisdiction and obtain any required prospectus relief as required by the regulator or securities regulatory authority in that jurisdiction.
10. The Filers are not in default of securities legislation in any province or territory in Canada, subject to the matter to which this Decision relates. The Filers are in compliance in all material respects with U.S. and U.K. securities laws.
11. The Filers do not currently prepare financial statements that are audited. During the two year period to which this Decision relates, the Filers will be working towards providing the Commission with annual financial statements audited in accordance with U.S. generally acceptable accounting principles and standards.
Services
Public Services
12. AngelList operates an online networking website (the Platform) that allows start-ups, accelerators, incubators, angel investors and other individuals in the start-up sector (together, the Participants) to connect with each other and to raise their profile in the start-up community. The Platform is primarily aimed at technology or technology-enabled Start-ups.
13. Any Participant can post a profile on the Platform that contains general information about itself, including, as applicable, its products or services, and its management team (a Profile). A Profile is publicly available to anyone accessing the Platform. A Start-up may also post confidential information and grant access only to certain Participants.
14. After setting up a Profile, a Participant may request a connection by visiting another Participant's profile (the Connection Services). AngelList will confirm the relationship between the Participants. A verified connection is required in order for a Participant to send other Participants a message or request an introduction to other Participant's connections.
15. Any Start-up can also post job openings on the Platform and seek applicants from Participants on the Platform for such job openings (the Recruiting Services) (together with the Connection Services, the Public Services).
Restricted Area and Restricted Services
16. The Platform includes a password protected area (the restricted area). Participants must apply to enter the restricted area, and ALA only permits accredited investors to enter the restricted area.
17. Once Participants have been approved for access to the restricted area, they may further apply to access certain services, which are referred to below as Restricted Services. ALA only permits Quality Investors to access the Restricted Services. Based on the Filers' experience in the United States, approximately 30% of U.S. accredited investors that apply to access the Restricted Services meet ALA's Quality Investor standard and are approved to use the Restricted Services.
18. The Restricted Services consist of the following:

a. ALA allows both Start-ups and Lead Investors (as defined below) the ability to raise money for a specific Start-up by forming a syndicate of investors through the Platform (the Syndicate Services).
b. ALA provides a transaction update email (the Transaction Update) to Quality Investors. ALA has an algorithm that uses objective criteria to identify Start-ups seeking to raise capital from a syndicate of investors and provides a list of these Start-ups to Quality Investors who request this information.
c. ALA offers a program for Quality Investors who plan to invest over USD$600,000 through the Platform (the Professional Investor Program). Under this program, ALA introduces these Quality Investors to Start-ups that do not wish to make it known publicly that they are raising capital through a syndicate.

19. In the U.S., accredited investors who are not Quality Investors may invest in diversified funds created by ALA (referred to as Funds) that invest in a wide variety of syndicates on the Platform. ALA is seeking registration only as a restricted dealer. ALA may, at a later date, wish to offer Ontario investors the opportunity to invest in the Funds. Prior to allowing Ontario investors the opportunity to invest in the Funds, ALA will apply for and obtain registration as required by the Commission.
Services to be Offered in Canada
20. AngelList proposes to make the Public Services available to investors.
21. ALA proposes to make the Syndicate Services available to:

a. Start-ups and Lead Investors (described below), and
b. Quality Investors,

subject to certain restrictions set out below.
22. ALA will make the Professional Investor Program available to Quality Investors who qualify as a "permitted client" as defined in section 1.1 of NI 31-103.
Syndicate Services
23. Syndicates can be formed by the founder or management of a Start-up itself or by an investor who is investing in a single Start-up, who wishes to make this investment opportunity available to other investors (co-investors) on the same terms and conditions, and who has been reviewed and approved by ALA as described in paragraphs 61 to 68 (a Lead Investor). Each syndicate only invests in securities of a single Start-up (a syndicate).
24. A Start-up or Lead Investor requests approval from ALA to establish the syndicate.
25. ALA reviews the request from the Start-up or Lead Investor and determines whether to allow the Start-up or Lead Investor to form a syndicate. In reviewing a request to form a syndicate, ALA reviews the Start-up for the following features:

a. Whether the Start-up is a growth-oriented technology or technology-enabled company that has the potential to develop into a large stand-alone business;
b. Whether the Start-up is focused on a product or service that will provide social, economic or environmental benefits or that is likely to meet a strong market demand; and
c. Whether, in ALA's opinion, the Start-up is likely to appeal to Quality Investors.

26. ALA will not permit reporting issuers or any public company in any other jurisdiction to form a syndicate on the Platform.
27. If ALA grants approval to form a syndicate, the Start-up or the Lead Investor, as applicable, completes and posts an investor note (the investor note) about the syndicate on the restricted area of the Platform. The investor note contains factual information about the proposed capital raise, the Start-up to be invested in, any co-investors, the risks associated with investing in the Start-up, past financing of the Start-up, and other key investment terms and conditions.
28. Interested Quality Investors may conduct due diligence on the Lead Investor and/or the Start-up. Quality Investors use their own judgement whether to invest in a syndicate.
29. Neither ALA nor the Lead Investor nor the Start-up:

a. provide specific recommendations or advice to particular Quality Investors about the suitability of an investment in a syndicate; or
b. recommend or solicit any particular purchase or sale by a Quality Investor of a syndicate's securities.

30. Interested Quality Investors may submit non-binding requests for additional information through the Platform to either the Start-up or Lead Investor about the Start-up that is being syndicated.
31. If there is sufficient interest to proceed with closing the investment in the syndicate, ALA establishes a special purpose entity (SPE) to accept the funds from committed investors and to acquire the Start-up's securities. The SPE formed to invest in the Start-up is required under U.S. securities law to have 99 or fewer investors. For investments in Eligible Canadian Start-ups, for tax reasons Canadian investors may be aggregated into a parallel Canadian SPE. The parallel Canadian SPE will otherwise invest on identical terms and conditions to a standard SPE.
32. ALA has engaged an arms' length consulting and fund administration firm (the SPE Manager) to provide administrative services in relation to the SPEs. On behalf of ALA, the SPE Manager handles the formation and organization of each SPE, certain closing procedures for the syndicate investments, securities filings, ongoing administration, and winding up the SPE where applicable.
33. The first time a Quality Investor makes a syndicate investment, prior to closing of that syndicate, the Quality Investor is asked to confirm his or her interest in investing in Start-ups generally, and to acknowledge a series of risk warnings including warnings as to risk of total loss of the investment, illiquidity of the securities and dilution risk, and the need for the Quality Investor to conduct his or her own due diligence on the Start-up. Detailed risk warning acknowledgements are not obtained from Quality Investors on subsequent investments; however, certain risks are acknowledged upon each Quality Investor's acceptance of the provisions of the Closing Documents (as defined below).
34. For each syndicate investment, prior to closing that syndicate, the Quality Investor is also asked to reconfirm its accredited investor status. If a Quality Investor indicates that its status has changed such that it is no longer an accredited investor, the investor is not permitted to invest in the syndicate and is not permitted to access to the restricted area of the Platform. Quality Investors electronically agree to and sign the SPE's closing documents on the Platform and are provided with wire instructions for their investment amounts.
35. After a Quality Investor commits to making an investment in a syndicate, the Quality Investor receives the following documents: the SPE's operating or limited partnership agreement, the SPE's private placement memorandum, the subscription or purchase agreement for the purchase of securities of the SPE, an investor statement (which is a screen confirming how much the Quality Investor invested in the SPE and the corresponding investment in the Start-up as of the specific date), a signature certificate (which is a screen showing the investor that documents have been digitally signed and a digital fingerprint provided for security reasons) and the investor note (collectively, the Closing Documents). The SPE Manager will retain the Closing Documents for eight years.
36. Either the Filers or SPE Manager will deliver electronically to the Commission any of the Closing Documents that constitute an offering memorandum under the Act. The Filers will inform the Start-up that the Start-up must deliver electronically to the Commission a copy of any document that constitutes an offering memorandum under the Act provided to Ontario investors that has not already been delivered to the Commission by the Filers or SPE Manager.
37. Prior to closing a syndicate, ALA uses a third party service (such as Blockscore or Jumio) to verify the identity of each Quality Investor. ALA also runs anti-money laundering and terrorist financing checks. The verification process and anti-money laundering and terrorist financing checks are performed on both individual and non-individual Quality Investors (entities). For non-individual Quality Investors, the Filers contact the investor by email to determine the identity of the individual principal(s) of the Quality Investor. AML and terrorist financing checks are performed through a politically exposed person (PEP) list and/or Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list search. Similar verification processes and checks will be performed for Ontario investors.
38. ALA conducts a review of each Start-up's constating documents and Closing Documents to ensure they are consistent with the information in the Profile and the investor note, the results of any background checks and any accompanying materials or information provided to it by an investor, the Lead Investor and/or the Start-up and determines if the Closing Documents are complete, consistent and not misleading. If it appears to ALA that the Closing Documents are incomplete, inconsistent or misleading, ALA will require the Closing Documents to be corrected, made complete, or clarified.
39. Neither the Filers nor the SPE holds, handles or controls any investor or issuer funds. The funds are held by and deposited in a single trust account that has been established by a FDIC-member U.S. bank in the name of the bank for the benefit of investors investing through the Platform. The Filers do not intermingle their own monies in this account.
40. Once all expected funds have been received by the bank, the bank notifies ALA. ALA then issues advice to the bank to initiate funds transfer to the Start-up.
41. All Quality Investors in the syndicate are e-mailed to inform them that the SPE investment, and the investment by the SPE in the Start-up, is finalized and to provide them with a copy of the final Closing Documents.
42. The Filers will utilize the same bank and procedures for investments in Eligible Canadian Start-ups completed on the Platform. Although initially the Platform will only support transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, the Filers plan to support transactions in Canadian dollars and utilize Canadian banking services as required for transactions in Canadian dollars.
43. Quality Investors have access to an individual account on the Platform where they may view information about the transaction and access copies of the Closing Documents. The Closing Documents will be retained and made available to Quality Investors through the Platform for at least eight years.
44. For their role in a syndicate, ALA and the Lead Investor will only receive compensation equal to a portion of the increase in value, if any, of the investment as calculated at the termination of the investment in the SPE (the Carried Interest), and will not receive any transaction-based compensation. None of the Filers, the Lead Investor, nor any of their officers or directors receive any other form of commission or transaction-based compensation related to the Restricted Services, including the Syndicate Services.
45. ALA requires that each investor in a syndicate pay a portion of the costs associated with the closing of the syndicate investment (such as legal fees) in proportion to the investor's investment in the Start-up.
46. Neither the syndicate nor the SPE borrows funds from investors or the public for any reason. The syndicate, the SPE and the Filers do not loan money or extend margin to investors that wish to invest in a Start-up through a syndicate.
47. The Filers do not facilitate any secondary trading of previously issued securities, whether originally issued through a syndicate or otherwise.
Professional Investor Program
48. ALA is involved with a number of syndicates in which the Start-up does not wish to disclose publicly that it is seeking funding (the Private Syndicates).
49. These Private Syndicates are only made available to Quality Investors who:

a. intend to invest over USD$600,000 in syndicates through the Platform;
b. invest, on average, at least USD$50,000 per month in syndicates;
c. sign a non-disclosure agreement with ALA; and
d. are able to make investment decisions in a timely manner.

50. ALA has automated functionality that matches between one to five Private Syndicates with the Quality Investor's selected objective criteria, based on filters that the Quality Investor selected when the Quality Investor signed up for the Professional Investor Program.
51. ALA provides the list of Private Syndicates to the Quality Investor.
52. The Quality Investor conducts its own due diligence on the Start-up of the Private Syndicate.
53. The Quality Investor will make its own decision as to which Private Syndicate to invest in. The same investment procedures that are used for a typical syndicate also apply to a Private Syndicate.
54. There are no fees for participating in the Professional Investor Program.
Participants
Investors
55. When opening an account with AngelList, each investor provides the Filers with the following information:

a. The category of accredited investor the investor meets, which for Ontario investors will correspond to the definition of accredited investor in section 73.3(1) of the Act;
b. The amount the investor has budgeted for investing in Start-ups on the Platform;
c. The investor's net worth band (e.g., > $1 million, > $2 million, > $5 million, with currency being denominated in U.S. dollars). For Canadian investors, bands will be denominated in Canadian dollars;
d. The proportion of the investor's net worth that the investor's budget for investing in Start-ups represents; and
e. The investor's experience in investing in Start-ups or working for or with private equity firms and venture capital firms and the investor's connection to other investors and Start-ups on the Platform.

The above-listed information is retained on the Platform by the Filers for 8 years.
56. In addition to providing the information in paragraph 55, each investor acknowledges the following risks associated with investing in Start-ups generally when signing up to access the Public Services and Restricted Services:

a. Risk of loss of an investor's entire investment in a Start-up;
b. Illiquidity risk;
c. No due diligence of a Start-up is conducted by the Filers;
d. Dilution risk;
e. Risk of change in the Start-up's plans, markets and products; and
f. No recommendation or advice is provided by the Filers to the investor.

In addition:

g. Prior to making an investment, the investor must acknowledge that it will receive limited or no initial or ongoing information about the investment; and
h. The investor note will disclose any conflicts of interest that may exist.

The above-listed information is retained on the Platform or by ALA for 8 years.
57. ALA assesses each investor's experience and knowledge with respect to venture capital and angel investing based upon the following information:

a. The investor's previous venture capital and angel investments and the size of those investments (as declared by the investor);
b. The investor's connections to other founders and investors, and ALA's assessment of those founders and investors; and
c. ALA's judgement about an investor's previous venture capital and angel investing experience with other top investors and the investor's reputation.

58. Using a computer algorithm, ALA rates each investor on a scale of one to ten based on the information provided by the investor (a Quality Investor Score). Only investors with a Quality Investor Score of at least 6.5 out of 10 are approved by ALA as "quality investors" (Quality Investors). In order to access the Restricted Services an investor must first be approved as a Quality Investor.
59. ALA does not initially approve an investor if the investor has an initial Quality Investor Score of less than 6.5 out of 10 or if the investor has indicated that he or she plans to invest more than 9% of his or her net worth in Start-ups. ALA may conduct a further review of these investors who are not initially approved. If ALA's manual review of the investor discloses information which would materially increase the investor's Quality Investor Score (for example, the investor has significant venture capital or angel investing experience that was not reflected on its profile on the Platform), the investor may be approved as a Quality Investor and permitted invest in syndicates through the Platform.
60. In Canada, accredited investors (as defined in section 73.3(1) of the Act) that are not Quality Investors will not be permitted to invest in syndicates through the Platform and will not be permitted access to the Restricted Services.
Lead Investors
61. Only accredited investors (as defined in section 73.3(1) of the Act) can apply to be Lead Investors. ALA retains the right and full discretion to determine whether a person may act as a Lead Investor.
62. ALA reviews a potential Lead Investor for previous experience related to venture capital and angel investing by reviewing the Lead Investor's activity on relevant social media and other websites (such as Crunchbase and Google).
63. ALA also reviews references provided by each Lead Investor related to the Lead Investor's prior Start-up investments.
64. If ALA is not satisfied that a Lead Investor has sufficient knowledge and experience related to Start-up and/or venture capital investing, ALA will also consider whether there is a Credible Investor involved in the syndicate and who is investing on the same terms and conditions as the investors in the syndicate.
65. Where ALA approves a Lead Investor to form a syndicate, ALA requires each Lead Investor to sign an agreement with ALA. For so long as the Lead Investor has an interest in the Start-up that the Lead Investor has syndicated, this agreement requires, among other things, the Lead Investor:

a. To assist ALA and the SPE Manager as necessary to allow ALA and the SPE Manager to comply with applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to the syndicate and the investment in the Start-up,
b. To provide ALA with information about the Start-up as required by ALA or the SPE Manager to service the syndicate, and
c. To provide ALA with written notice of certain events, including subsequent investment in the Start-up by the Lead Investor, sale or transfer of the Lead Investor's securities in the Start-up, and how the Lead Investor has voted.

66. Lead Investors are required to disclose all conflicts of interest to ALA and to potential Quality Investors. Conflicts of interest that must be disclosed include whether the Lead Investor invested in previous round of financing by the Start-up, is an employee or officer of the Start-up, or has family members working at the Start-up, any other circumstances judged by ALA to constitute conflicts or potential conflicts.
67. The Lead Investor invests either directly with the Start-up or alongside other investors in the syndicate on the same terms and conditions as the investors in the syndicate.
68. Prior to the closing of the syndicate, ALA conducts a background check on the Lead Investor (through a third party service provider), including criminal record, securities regulatory, AML, terrorist financing, and economic and political sanctions watch-lists.
Start-ups
69. ALA conducts background checks on the Start-up and each officer and director of the Start-up (through a third party service provider) before the close of a syndicate.
70. The background checks conducted by ALA include: criminal record, securities regulatory, AML, terrorist financing, and economic and political sanctions watch-lists.
71. ALA does not permit a syndicate to close, if any of the Start-up, its president or chief executive officer has pled guilty to or has been found guilty of an offence related to or has entered into a settlement agreement in a matter that involved fraud or securities violations or if the Start-up is bankrupt.
Additional Requirements
72. Ontario investors will only be permitted to invest in a Start-up that seeks to raise capital through a syndicate on the Platform in one of the following circumstances:

a. Permitted Clients. Ontario investors who qualify as permitted clients (as defined in section 1.1 of NI 31-103) and who waive the requirement for ALA to conduct a suitability assessment, in accordance with subsection 13.3(4) of NI 31-103, may invest in any syndicate on the Platform and participate in the Professional Investor Program.
b. The Start-up is participating in or within the past 24 months has successfully completed an Approved Incubator Program. Ontario Quality Investors may invest in syndicates where the Start-up is an Eligible Canadian Start-up that is participating in or has successfully completed an Approved Incubator Program.
c. Other Start-ups -- Subject to limits on the number of Ontario Quality Investors. Over the two-year period that this Decision relates to, up to a maximum of 500 Ontario Quality Investors may invest in one or more syndicates that meet one of the following criteria:

i. The founder of the Start-up is an Experienced Founder.
ii. Either the Lead Investor of the syndicate or at least one investor in the Start-up that the syndicate is investing in, other than the Lead Investor, is a Credible Investor, and the syndicate is investing in the Start-up on the same terms and conditions as the Credible Investor.
iii. The Start-up has, within the previous three years, received funding from a federal, state, provincial or territorial government program that supports small business or Start-ups as part of its mandate, such as Business Development Bank of Canada, BDC Capital, the Investment Accelerator Fund, Ontario Centres of Excellence, and the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario.

The 500 Quality Investors limit is measured from the period commencing on the date of this Decision and ending on the expiry of this Decision.

Yes. Using AngelList to raise money is legal. It doesn't impose any more legal burdens on a startup than raising money offline. In fact, hundreds of startups have used AngelList to raise money. For more details, see the legal opinion that using AngelList is not a general solicitation and that AngelList is not a broker-dealer.

You can change your user profile to only be viewable by logged-in AngelList users on your privacy settings page.Restricted sections of startup profiles, such as fundraising information, are visible only to people you select and are never visible to search engines.If you're looking for a job, see Candidates: Who can see my profile? for more details about profile privacy.

How do I use AngelList to raise money if my startup doesn't get featured?



First, fill in all of the sections of your startup profile with concise, compelling information. Browse around AngelList, especially noting the featured startups, to find good profiles and learn from them.Make sure you add all of your founders, employees, advisors, investors and so on. Your team members' followers get a feed update whenever a team member confirms a role.Make sure you add the $ amounts for all investors in your current round. $ amounts for specific investors are displayed only to the startup's contact person and that individual investor.Second, be proactive. Use search filters to find investors tagged with your startup's markets, in your location and that have invested in companies similar to yours. Use AngelList like a social network; follow people and companies, comment on posts and like others' updates.

If my company has pivoted, what should I do with my startup profile?



If you think your startup followers will want to know about the post-pivot startup, edit your existing profile. If not, start a new profile. For example, if the product and team are staying the same and you're just going after a different market, keep the profile. But if you're changing your product and market, and you've lost half of your co-founders, start a new profile. The case where you're keeping the team but changing the product and market is trickier — use your judgment. In either case, be sure to list the funding history of the company on the profile.

How can I delete a startup profile I created?



If your profile hasn't been published yet or is still in "Draft mode", you can delete it by going to "Edit" and choosing "Delete Startup Profile".  Similarly, if you are the only person connected to your startup, you can delete it in the same way.Each profile on AngelList can be connected to other founders, employees, advisors and investors. Removing one profile can remove important data from other profiles. We can't completely delete profiles from the site if they are connected to other users or profiles, but we will convert the profile to a "Community Profile" and remove some of the information you added when you created it.

How do I prevent investors from stealing my idea?



If you're obviously fund-able (e.g. you previously started a company that made lots of money for its investors), you might want to consider adding less information to your profile. If you're not obviously fund-able, consider the risk of sharing your idea to be a cost of doing business. If you're not willing to take this risk, don't use AngelList. Also, keep in mind that it is rare for someone to care enough about your idea to “steal” it.

What does Current and Previous Investors mean?



Current Investors are investors that are investing on the same terms as this round, whether right now or have in the past. Previous Investors are the others, i.e. those that invested on different terms to those currently offered.An investor does not have to have sent money or signed docs to be listed as Current, they just have to be committed to invest in the round and confirm the tagging.

Public Fundraising





If I raise on AngelList is it public / general solicitation?



No. Almost all deals on AngelList are private to accredited investors only. This means that they fall under the 506(b) regime and are not public fundraising under Reg A or general solicitation under 506(c). However, companies can elect to raise under general solicitation if they wish.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








What is public fundraising?



Public fundraising allows startups tell the general public they're raising money—on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, TV, advertisements, etc. The legal term for public fundraising is ‘general solicitation’.Whether startups raise money publicly or not, they can only accept money from accredited investors. Startups that raise publicly also have the legal burden of verifying that their investors are accredited. If a startup that raised publicly closes their round on AngelList (via syndicates), AngelList will handle all 506c investor verification. 

Link to this
·
Updated Sep 17, 2015








Does AngelList support public fundraising?



Adding your startup or funding round to AngelList doesn't affect whether you are raising publicly or privately. Fundraising activity on AngelList is only visible to logged in, accredited investors.If you announce your raise publicly (for example, by social media or to your company's newsletter), you will need to collect evidence from all investors to verify their accredited investor status.If you close the round on AngelList (via syndicates), AngelList will provide accreditation verification for all investors in your round, free of charge. If you close your round offline, your investors can still get verified for free by AngelList, and can provide our verification letter to you or your company counsel at closing to satisfy the SEC's requirements.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








Should I fundraise publicly?



Good question. Public fundraising can be useful for companies with a customer base of accredited investors (e.g. service for physicians) or for companies with a large social media reach. However, startups should be aware that enabling public fundraising will make it easier for press to disclose details about their fundraising efforts. Also, verifying that all investors are accredited takes time and effort, and may discourage some investors from participating in the deal.

Link to this
·
Updated Sep 17, 2015








What if I don't want to fundraise publicly?



By default, startup fundraising information is just available to investors. This prevents the general public from seeing fundraising information.To avoid triggering the requirements of general solicitation, don't promote your raise publicly, and ask your employees, investors and advisors to refrain from public discussion also.

Can I raise money from unaccredited investors to crowdfund my startup?

Updated Aug 12, 2015








What regulations do I need to follow if I fundraise publicly?



When you raise money publicly, you must have a higher standard for accreditation verification: you must take ‘reasonable steps’ to verify that your investors are  accredited. For example, your investor could provide an income tax form. It is not enough for your investors to merely swear that they are accredited. Fortunately, AngelList will do the work of collecting the evidence that your investors meet this higher standard.If you choose not to fundraise publicly, you can meet a lower standard of having a ‘reasonable belief’ that your investors are accredited. Historically, investors have sworn they are accredited in this case—although the SEC has stated that may not be enough.Also see What kind of statements can I make about publicly fundraising companies?.

How should the press write about startups raising funds on AngelList?



If you are covering a startup that is fundraising on AngelList, you should avoid writing about financing details for companies that are not publicly raising money – also known as general solicitation. If you do write about them – even by mistake – it can cause them legal problems due to SEC regulations. Here's how to steer clear of trouble.It is okay to write about company fundraising details on AngelList if:
The company name and details are visible on Invest Online while you are logged out of AngelListThe company's AngelList profile page shows a green "Public" tag, like this company, under the Fundraising sectionThe company can be found in this filtered Companies listAll of the above are visible without being signed in to an AngelList account – in fact, this is how you should browse, since all you will be able to see is publicly available info.If they're not meeting any of the conditions above, don't discuss or publicize their fundraising details. Only a small percentage of companies on AngelList have chosen to fundraise publicly. Unfortunately, doing so causes them to bear a lot of extra expense (and potentially lose investors) due to the need to collect a lot more information from potential investors. Publishing information about private companies would "break the seal" – automatically making them operate under the SEC’s 506c rule, which covers general solicitation.Also: if you attempt to pose as an investor in order to get access to info about companies that are raising privately, we will permanently ban you from AngelList.

Accreditation Reports





What is an Accreditation Report?



An Accreditation Report is a web page hosted by AngelList that investors can use to confirm their accreditation status. Once created, it can be reused for any investment that requires proof of accredited status. 
Accreditation Reports meet the SEC’s new 506(c) accreditation standard for investing in publicly fundraising companies. It also meets the lower standard for investing in privately fundraising companies (the biggest difference between the standard for public and private fundraising is the requirement to provide proof of your finances for public financings.)
Many lawyers also consider things startups have always done to require the new standard, e.g. announcing a financing at a demo day or closing a round after a major article leaks about their financing.

What is an accredited investor?



Accredited investors meet standards defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission which allow them to invest in certain private securities offerings. Most startups raising money do so from accredited investors only.The SEC web site contains the full definition. In general, any of the following would meet the standard:• Individuals with annual income over $200K (individually) or $300K (with spouse) over the last 2 years and an expectation of the same this year• Individuals with net assets over $1 million, excluding the primary residence (unless more is owed on the mortgage than the residence is worth)• An institution with over $5 million in assets, such as a venture fund or a trust• An entity made up entirely of accredited investors

Why do I need to show that I'm an accredited investor?

Why is a credit report necessary?



If you claim that you are an accredited investor because you have over $1 million in net assets, then the company you are investing in is required to verify your debts as well. AngelList requests this credit report and includes only total debts (excluding mortgages) in your Accreditation Report.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








What do I need to provide to prove that I am an accredited investor?



If you are accredited based on income, you will need to provide documentation of income for the past 2 years. This can be in the form of tax returns, W2s or other official documents.
If you are accredited based on assets, you can provide recent brokerage statements clearly showing your name, the date and the value of your account(s). We will also pull your credit report and deduct any non-mortgage debts shown from the value of your assets to arrive at net assets.
You can also provide a recent letter from a reviewer like a CPA, attorney, investment advisor or investment broker. Our accreditation verification process will allow you to trigger an email to your reviewer using acceptable language.

How long does an Accreditation Report remain valid?



You must swear you are still accredited each time you generate a link to share the report.However, the proof only needs to be updated periodically. How often depends on what the investment entity is (individual, firm, trust) and what you use to prove your status: income or assets.• Income proof can be used until April 15th of the year following its verification• Asset proof can be used for 3 months• All other cases, such as proof of a trust's accreditation through the accreditation of its entire individual membership, are currently limited to 3 monthsThese durations drive the green-colored "valid until" date you will see on every Accreditation Report. Once expired, updated proof will have to be presented to set a new validity date, but the Accreditation Report will remain publicly viewable.

Does an Accreditation Report constitute "reasonable steps to verify" accredited status?

So far, companies represented by Cooley, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Gunderson Dettmer, and many other firms have accepted investments based on this evidence.

Syndicates





What is a syndicate?



A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry.Here's an example: Sara, a notable angel investor, decides to lead a syndicate. The syndicate investors agree to invest $200K total in each of her future deals and pay her 15% carry.When Sara makes her next investment, she offers to invest $250K in the company. She personally invests $50K and offers the remaining $200K to her syndicate.If the investment is successful, the syndicate investors first receive their $200K, after which every dollar of the syndicate’s profit is split 80% to the syndicate investors, 15% to Sara and 5% to AngelList Advisors.  AngelList Advisors is a venture capital exempt reporting advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a subsidiary of AngelList.View syndicates »

What are the benefits of syndicates?



Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table.

How much do syndicates cost?



Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList Advisors.Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each deal—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList or AngelList Advisors does not profit from these fees.The lead and AngelList Advisors do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

What is the legal structure of a syndicate?



Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically to invest in the company.  The fund is formed as a series LLC.The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors.The lead usually does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders.

What is carry?



Carry is a share of the profit of an investment that is paid to the managers of the investment. It is short for ‘carried interest’.In a VC fund, the limited partners of the fund pay carry to the general partners if the entire fund is profitable. This is called fund carry or net carry.In syndicates, investors pay carry to the lead for any profitable investment. This is called deal carry. Syndicates use deal carry so investors can opt out of any investment or stop investing anytime.Learn more about carry and the economics of

Do syndicates receive pro rata rights?



Syndicates receive pro rata rights if the lead negotiates them with the startup.  If a syndicate has pro rata rights, syndicate investors in the initial round may have the opportunity to invest their pro rata allocation in subsequent financings. Any remaining allocation may be offered to other investors or funds.  The pro rata may not be offered to syndicate investors if the lead does not participate, if it is unlikely that a reasonable amount of the pro rata will be filled, or for other reasons. Pro rata rights vary in strength and enforceability. Pro rata rights may be waivable by a majority of investors in the round or waived as a condition to a new financing round.

Leads: What is minimum I have to invest in each deal?



The minimum investment for a lead who is investing her own money is generally 2.5% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors. The minimum investment for a lead who is investing out of a fund raised from limited partners is generally 20% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors.This minimum only applies to capital raised from individuals. Syndicates can raise an unlimited amount of capital from institutional investors such as platform funds.For example, if a lead puts $5K of her own money in a startup, she can raise an additional $195K from individual investors in her syndicate. She can also raise an unlimited amount of capital from a platform fund like CSC Upshot.The minimum investment may be reduced if a notable investor is making a significant investment in the round. It may also be reduced in pro ratas and other special situations. Investors in the syndicate will be notified if the minimum is reduced.Investors can also view the lead's investment amount in any deal and opt out of the deal, for any reason.Learn more

Leads: What happens if my allocation in a deal is smaller than my syndicate?



Each investor’s commitment will be reduced pro rata if your allocation is smaller than the total commitments from syndicate investors. Here's an example. Sara has a syndicate with 10 accepted investors. Each investor has committed $10K to the syndicate, for a total of $100K. Sara personally invests $20K in the deal and asks for an additional $100K for her syndicate. However, the startup is only able to allocate $50K to the syndicate. So each of her syndicate investors will invest $5K instead of the $10K they requested.If an investor‘s reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal, the investor will invest the minimum investment. In this case, if the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicate's allocation, the lead will use her judgment to reduce investors’ amounts for that deal. The lead will likely favor backers who have expertise in the company‘s markets or have large investment amounts.In some deals, a maximum may be placed on aggregate commitments by the platform funds.

Leads: Should I negotiate for pro rata rights?



Yes. Pro rata rights are important for AngelList and syndicate leads to invest additional capital in winning investments and generate larger returns.

Leads: What is the lead's carry in a pro rata?



The lead's carry in a pro rata is the same as the initial round, as long as her investment is greater than or equal to either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller.The lead's carry in a pro rata will be reduced by 5% if her investment is less than either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller. AngelList Advisors, the fund's investment adviser, will receive this additional carry in addition to its usual 5% carry. This is due to  the added work and risk, and since AngelList Advisors is less able to look to the lead’s decision when advising the fund.In both cases, if the lead does not provide access to the pro rata and provide relevant information, she will not earn any carry and AngelList will receive a total of 10% carry.

Leads: Limitations on syndicate investments in certain foreign companies (PFIC & CFC)




Investments in certain types of foreign companies ares subject to disadvantaged tax treatment and  ongoing compliance requirements. 
These rules are complicated, but if the investment is in a foreign holding company it may be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)  and if the investment is in a foreign company that is majority owned by US taxpayers, it may be a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). 
As a result of the added tax and  compliance burdens, AngelList does not generally facilitate investment in either PFIC's or CFC's. When a syndicate makes an investment in a non-US company, the company will be asked to certify that it is neither a PFIC nor a CFC and agree to ongoing compliance requirements. 
 A lead should confirm the PFIC / CFC status with a foreign company early on to avoid wasted efforts. Any investment in a company that cannot certify to being a non-PFIC / CFC will either not be facilitated on AngelList or will require additional disclosures and approvals from AngelList.

Investors: Why isn't there a higher minimum investment for leads?



Raising the minimum investment would cause some leads to stop syndicating their investments. Instead, they would start or join venture capital funds, which typically have no minimums.The
partners of a VC fund typically provide 1-5% of the fund's capital, but
also take out 15-25% in management fees. In
effect, they don't make a contribution to the fund. The minimum for leads investing their own money in a syndicate is 2.5%. And the minimum for leads investing out of a fund is 20%. Except in rare cases, leads receive no management fees from the syndicate. So, for the vast
majority of leads, syndicates are already more expensive than venture capital
funds. Raising the minimum would cause some leads to stop syndicating their
investments. They would instead invest through a venture capital fund.

Raising the minimum would also cause some leads who are new to investing to stop altogether, because it is already a significant portion of their net worth. This would lead to less diversity of investment opportunities from new leads.Investors who are unhappy with a lead's contribution can always opt out of an investment. They can also invest in AngelList Funds, which make investment decisions on behalf of investors, for no additional cost or carry.Learn more about the economics of syndicates.

Certain taxable events may result in income or losses flowing through the special-purpose fund to its investors.  Investors with taxable income or loss will receive K-1s.If the fund holds an equity interest in a portfolio company, there is a taxable event on exits or when the company is dissolved or files for bankruptcy. In rare instances, there may also be a taxable event if the fund receives a dividend or distribution.

A management fee is a quarterly or annual fee added onto a deal, meant to compensate the lead for their time and expenses. Leads may charge management fees for hiring employees, maintaining an office, paying salaries, etc. This is similar to how venture capital firms operate. However, in the case of an AngelList syndicate, because investors can opt in or out on each deal, all economics (including management fees) are calculated on a deal-by-deal basis.

Investors: How do management fees work?



For each deal, the lifetime total management fee (ex. 3%) is collected upfront and drawn down by the lead over time (ex. 0.25% quarterly, for three years). If there's an exit before the entire management fee is drawn, undrawn capital is returned to investors. If there's a profitable exit, the lead must return the entire amount raised (including the management fee) before earning any carried interest.

Investors: How do management fees benefit investors?



Management fees allow leads to hire staff, maintain offices, and be competitive with venture capital firms that have fees at their disposal. Many of the world's top investors are VC General Partners. By introducing management fees, AngelList is better equipped to support this cohort of investors and attract them to share their deals online.Over time, many of the current syndicate leads will face financial pressure to start or join venture capital firms where they can earn fees to offset their costs. They may choose this instead of syndicating. Management fees help mitigate this financial pressure and retain leads on the AngelList platform.

You can transfer funds from your bank to your investor account and use those funds to invest in startups and syndicates.You can also use the account to receive distributions when one of your investments has an exit. You create an account when you invest in a startup or fund a syndicate.

What is the minimum balance?



An investor account only requires a minimum balance if you fund a syndicate.The minimum balance is equal to your largest backing amount. For example, if you back Kevin Rose for $10,000 per deal and Elad Gil for $5,000 per deal, your minimum balance is $10,000.

Taxes: I'm foreign, do I need to file a return?



As an investor in the fund, we are required to send you a K-1 from the fund when it has a filing requirement. We also send the information to the IRS. Whether or not you need to file a US tax return depends on many factors. Since we are not tax advisors, we suggest that you contact a CPA or tax attorney who can give you personalized guidance.

Updated Mar 13








Taxes: Why does my K-1 show income/I never received this income?





OID Interest: Under current tax regulations, convertible notes are considered to be a type of OID (Original Issue Discount) instrument.  Internal Revenue Code section 1272 requires holders of OID instruments to recognize interest income every year despite no interest being actually paid out. This requirement remains in effect whether the note holder uses the cash or the accrual method of accounting.

Conversion: During the year, the convertible note held by a fund converted into shares of the portfolio company. At the time of conversion, rather than paying cash for the interest accrued, the company issued additional shares to the fund. Because the fund recognized this increase in value, the tax code considers this taxable income and requires that it be passed through to the fund's investors.

LLC Passthrough: Say Fund X invests into Company Z, which is a partnership/LLC. Under the tax code, partnerships/LLCs do not pay their own tax. The income or loss of the partnership/LLC is passed through to partners/members who recognize their portion of that income/loss on their own returns. Although Company Z had a profit for the year, they have not made any distributions, but have instead reinvested that profit back into the company. Despite not receiving any cash, investors are still required to include that income in their individual tax returns.

Taxes: I heard that the underlying investment went out of business or is on its way out.  Why is there no loss on my K-1?



We do not shut down SPVs or write off the investments before a bankruptcy or other official proceeding has run its full course.

Updated Mar 13








Taxes: I invested in fund X, why didn't I receive a K-1 for it?



Fund X neither received income nor incurred any expense during the year and therefore had no tax filing requirement.  As such, no K-1s were issued for the fund.

Updated Mar 01








Taxes: The company had a down round during the year. Why doesn't the loss show up on my K-1?



The assets held by the funds are accounted for at their cost basis. As these funds are only passive investors, we do not mark to market. Only active dealers and traders in securities may elect the mark-to-market accounting method.

Link to this
·
Updated Mar 01








Taxes: Why am I just getting this K-1? Aren't K-1s required to be sent by the end of January?



The due date for furnishing K-1s to investors is the same as the due date for filing the Fund's tax return. The initial deadline for the 2016 tax year is March 15. However, if additional time is required to file an accurate return, an extension of time to file may be granted. Once an extension has been filed, the deadline becomes September 15. By virtue of the unavailability of certain required information, this was the earliest we were able to issue the K-1s.

Taxes: There is a distribution amount on my AngelList K-1, but I never received the cash. What happened?



Distributions are credited to your AngelList account. Please reach out to investors@aladvisors.co if you are having trouble receiving a distribution.

Taxes: I'm foreign, will there be withholding on my capital gains?



Under tax current law, capital gains are not taxable to foreign investors and therefore we do not withhold. However, there are provisions of FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and Regulation § 1.1473-1 which state that capital gains will become a withholdable payment. Currently, this is set to be enforced starting in 2019.

How do I get a fund to invest in my startup?



Funds only invest in deals syndicated on AngelList. The Investment Committee will automatically consider every syndicated deal.

What are AngelList Funds?



AngelList Funds are a convenient way for accredited investors to build a diversified portfolio of startups.  One up-front investment gets you exposure to each fund's target number of startups. AngelList Advisors (an AngelList entity) invests each fund's capital in select syndicated deals on AngelList. We return capital when any company in which the fund invests exits. This is not like a traditional VC fund with professional, compensated GPs; this is a no-fee fund of funds that broadly invests in syndicates on AngelList. This is suited to investors taking a diversified approach to investing rather than picking individual companies or syndicates.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








How do funds select deals?



Funds are designed to give broad market exposure, either to the early-stage market generally or to a specific sector (depending on the fund in which you invest). There is a multi-stage selection process that includes, among other things, evaluating co-investors, conflicts, concentration in any one syndicate and non-arms length transactions. We may not apply the same process to every deal.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








How much do funds invest in each deal? 



Each fund will aim to invest at least $20K in a deal, but generally not more than 10% of the total amount syndicated in each deal to avoid concentration in any one deal and comply with securities laws.

·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








In how many deals will each fund invest?



Each fund will aim to invest in 100 startups or more, subject to the total amount of capital raised by the fund.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








Are there management fees or costs?



AngelList
Funds do not charge any management fees.A small portion
of the capital will be used to cover the out-of-pocket costs of setting up and
administering each fund over its lifetime. Each individual investment also has
out-of-pocket costs (and in rare cases a management fee payable to a lead) that are covered pro rata by the
investors, which will include the fund.The total
out-of-pocket costs for each fund are estimated to be $50,000 or more.

·
Updated Sep 25, 2016








Will carry be charged?



AngelList Funds do not charge a carry. However, each individual investment charges carry. A typical carry for an individual investment is 20%. 15% of that carry goes to the lead investor of the syndicate and 5% goes to AngelList.

When are the capital calls? 



There is only one capital call for each fund, which happens during that fund's initial closing.

Can I sell my stake and get out early? 



You may not sell your stake or otherwise transfer your interest outside of serious events like death or divorce. Startup investments are highly risky and illiquid.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








How long do funds last?



The investment period depends on the amount of deals and follow-ons done by the Fund, and the amount per deal. We currently estimate that it may take 2 or more years to invest $5M.Thereafter, the fund will continue to hold the investments until each position has been exited, liquidated or closed, and realized net profits, if any, have been distributed to investors. We estimate that this may take up to 8 years, or more.

Will the funds exercise pro-rata rights? 



Funds may exercise pro-rata rights to make follow-on investments in deals where there is a VC firm leading the round, the valuation is higher than the previous round, the total amount raised is higher than the previous round and/or there are new investors in the company.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








What reporting will funds do?



Funds will disclose fund investments after they are finalized, and may provide qualitative updates to investors when available. Funds will not post audited financial statements. Funds will not mark valuations to market each year given the extreme difficulty of doing that in an accurate manner for early stage investments.
