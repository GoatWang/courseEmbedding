It tells you how to do the basic procedures in a straightforward cookbook way, without alot of theoretical background.  Old-school purists may object to this, but just as you don't need to understand Fourier optics to use a microscope, you really don't need to understand how Laemmli gels work in order to be able to use them to resolve proteins.  This book just tells you how to do what you need to do, and for that purpose its really perfect.  Using this book, you can singlehandedly do each technique without needing to ask anyone or read anything else, it is entirely self-contained.  There aren't too many methods books that can compare with this one in terms of ease of use.  I have used this book and its earlier edition for years and I highly recommend it to everyone who is starting to work with proteins.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsVery useful bookByS. Nataliyaon August 13, 2005Format: PaperbackThis is very good book for people who are starting to learn protein biochemistry techniques. I have never worked before with protein biochemistry and I have gotten a lot of very important information from this book. Style of the book is very good, simple and easy to understand. Subject is described step by step starting from simple things as measuring protein concentration going to explanation more difficult protein techniques in detail. There is not only text information but also there are a lot of very useful pictures, which help to understand all procedures.People who work with me in the lab also were impressed with this book. They worked with those techniques for years but still found a lot of useful things in this book.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsBasic Guide to Protein Separation, Isolation and Purification TechniquesBykangaroonoon November 15, 2005Format: PaperbackBollag et al. has done a decent job with the basic protein methods used for extraction, isolation, etc.  I definitely recommend this handbook for any protein laboratory.  However, this book may not be used exclusively as it is slightly outdated and there needs to be a damage control/backup plan for exceptional proteins.I am still looking into finding compatible reference books, and once I find some, I will update the list on  bottom.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsThis is a really great book.ByA customeron September 21, 1998Format: PaperbackThis is a good handbook for starters and students, contains methods that  easy to follow and understand, I love this book.Read more0Comment|

Description
Protein Methods
Daniel M. Bollag/ Michael D. Rozycki /Stuart J. Edelstein
Reviews from the first edition
"...it is very well written...would certainly be of use to
undergraduate and postgraduate students entering the complex world
of protein preparation and to more experienced scientists entering
this field for the first time."-Biotechnology and Applied
Biochemistry
"The book presents these topics with loads of practical detail, so
that the reader has little need to consult other reference sources
to carry out the techniques described. All in all, a useful
book..." -Theoretical & Applied Genetics
"...clearly written with protocols that are easy to follow and the
text is well spread-out and easy to read...all methods are fully
referenced...a useful book for beginners at a reasonable price."
-FEBS Letters
This revised and expanded Second Edition of Protein Methods remains
the first source for a complete summary of tested and proven
protein techniques. Now divided into two parts, the book begins
with the essential chapters from the first edition, updated to
reflect important changes in methodology. The chapter on protein
isolation includes a new section focusing on the isolation of
proteins from inclusion bodies. In the second section, four new
chapters are devoted to protein purification and
crystallization.
Chapters include
* Preparation for Protein Isolation
* Protein Extraction and Solubilization
* Protein Concentration Determination
* Concentrating Protein Solutions
* Gel Electrophoresis Under Denaturing Conditions
* Gel Electrophoresis Under
...and feature
* reagent items and equipment required for each method
* chapter "view-at-a-glance" tabs
* illustrations for all gel applications and other methods
* complete supplier list
* appendices of basic chemical parameters and molecular data
* key references
* descriptive tables
* Safety notes.
