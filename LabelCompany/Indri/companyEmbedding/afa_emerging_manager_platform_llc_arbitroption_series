Cayman Advantage
Cayman Advantage About Cayman Islands Cayman offers a well-regulated and internationally respected, tax-neutral, offshore business environment. The type of Cayman structure required or best suited for a particular endeavour will depend largely on the type of business and whether it will be conducting its affairs locally or outside of the Cayman Islands. If the business is operating in another country, advice from that country's legal and tax counsel will be of prime importance in understanding the benefits that can be derived from setting up a business in Cayman. A fully operational physical presence with locally based staff, as opposed to a nominal presence through a registered office address, can be an essential component in ensuring compliance with many international and local reporting requirements.

How to Launch
How to LaunchThere are many factors to consider when launching a new fund.  From deciding how best to structure your fund; to preparing a business plan and developing marketing materials to facilitate capital raising efforts; to creating the infrastructure and selecting the service providers supporting your fund launch.
At AFA, our expertise and knowledge of the alternative investments industry provides fund managers with valuable insight and guidance as they navigate the fund launch process.  AFA provides Advisory Services and Offshore Legal Services to early stage fund managers during the critical launch period, as well as throughout the lifecycle of the fund.

Emerging Manager Platform


The AFA Emerging Manager Platform offers early stage fund managers a cost effective turnkey solution to provide the infrastructure required to support a new fund launch, without incurring capital intensive start-up costs.  Fund managers will receive a high quality service from top tier SSAE 16 compliant service providers at significantly reduced rates.  Services include legal, prime brokerage, fund administration, and audit & tax.


AFA Emerging Manager Platform LLC
    – a Delaware Limited Liability Company providing the platform infrastructure to US based (onshore) funds.

AFA Emerging Manager Platform Cayman SPC
    – a Cayman domiciled segregated portfolio company registered as a section 4(3) regulated mutual fund with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) providing the platform infrastructure to Cayman domiciled (offshore) funds.

The AFA Emerging Manager Platform operates as a Segregated Portfolio Company having its own Private Placement Memorandum, with each fund established as a Segregated Portfolio or Sub-Fund on the platform. Fund managers participating on the platform will have supplemental fund documents (PPM, Subscription Documents, etc.) specific to their fund strategy, fee structure, investor dynamics, etc. These documents will be drafted for a significantly reduced fee.  The time to launch an individual Segregated Portfolio or Sub-Fund on the platform is 3-4 weeks versus 3-4 months, allowing fund managers to launch quickly and cost effectively, while building a performance track record and raising additional investor capital.
Each fund on the platform operates independently, and will have its own set of fund documents, brokerage trading account, fund bank account, and fund investment capital will not be comingled.  Clients joining the AFA Emerging Manager platform will receive the following services:
