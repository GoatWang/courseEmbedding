S. Haunani Apoliona, MSW
      Office of Hawaiian Affairs Trustee At-Large


   For more than thirty-six years, Haunani Apoliona has dedicated her life mission to working with and on behalf of the Native Hawaiian community. In 2012 Haunani completed sixteen years of work at the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA). In 2012, Haunani was re-elected to serve another four year term (2012-2016). She served the Native Hawaiian community statewide for nineteen years at ALU LIKE, Inc. and continues to serve through a variety of business, cultural and civic activities and is recognized statewide for her music performances and compositions. After earning her Master's degree in Social Work from the University of Hawaiʻi in 1976, she worked briefly in the Third Circuit Court on the island of Hawaiʻi. From 1978 she worked at ALU LIKE as an Employment and Training Counselor, Community Specialist, Oʻahu Island Center Administrator, Health and Services Program Planner, Director of Programs and eventually serving, from 1991-1997, as President and Chief Executive Officer. 
      



      Haunani's employment served as a medium for her civic and broad-based community work. She resigned her ALU LIKE position after her 1996 election as a Trustee of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, on the day of her swearing in January 10, 1997. In 2000 and in 2004, and again in 2008 Haunani was elected to her second, third and fourth four-year terms as an OHA Trustee. She has served OHA in various leadership positions and has served  as Chairperson of the OHA Board of Trustees from 2000 to 2010, as the longest serving Board Chairperson in OHA’s thirty-four year history. In that capacity, she leads the OHA Board's pursuit of Federal Recognition for Native Hawaiians, formation of a Native Hawaiian governing entity, defended against lawsuits aimed at diminishing Native Hawaiian entitlements, resolved long-standing ceded land revenue disputes, and advocated for a vast array of advocacy initiatives for programs and services which benefit OHA's Native Hawaiian beneficiaries. 
      


      Haunani has served on nearly three dozen boards, committees and commissions, including President's Advisory Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islanders, Queen Liliʻuokalani Children's Center Advisory Board, Queen Emma Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, Bank of Hawaiʻi Corporation, the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum Board and U.S. Bureau of the Census Race Ethnic Advisory Council (REAC).
      



      Finally, Haunani is a master slack-key guitarist who has won several Nā Hōkū Hanohano awards and composed many songs, including the Hōkū Award winning ALU LIKE song. She has been a professional entertainer since 1977 and since May 1982 performs as a member of Olomana.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

S. Haunani Apoliona - Ellison S. Onizuka Memorial Award



Cultural Advocate to be Presented with NEA Human and Civil Rights Award

WASHINGTON  - July 02, 2008 - 
S. Haunani Apoliona, a trustee and the current chairperson of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, will receive the National Education Association's Ellison S. Onizuka Memorial Award as part of the Association's 42nd Human and Civil Rights Awards Dinner on July 2, 2008, in Washington, D.C.
NEA's Onizuka Memorial Award is presented for distinguished leadership in education and honors an individual whose activities have made significant improvements in educational opportunities and advanced the achievement of equal opportunity for Asian and Pacific Islanders.
"S. Haunani Apoliona has dedicated her entire life to the Hawaiian people," says NEA President Reg Weaver. "Think how the lives of children would be improved if we all had the dedication and did the hard work on their behalf that S. Haunani Apoliona has provided through the years."
Apoliona has lobbied extensively for the passage of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (the Akaka Bill) in Congress. The legislation would recognize Native Hawaiians, much as American Indians and Alaska Natives have been recognized, as aboriginal, indigenous native people whose ancestors exercised sovereignty over the lands and areas that subsequently became part of the United States. The legislation has been approved by the House of Representatives, but awaits the approval of the Senate.
NEA's Ellison S. Onizuka Memorial Award honors the first Asian/Pacific Islander chosen by NASA for the astronaut program. Onizuka (1946-1986) was a Japanese American aerospace engineer and was serving as a mission specialist on the space shuttle Challenger when it exploded on January 28, 1986, killing all aboard.
###
The National Education Association is the nation’s largest professional employee organization, representing 3.2 million elementary and secondary teachers, higher education faculty, education support professionals, school administrators, retired educators and students preparing to become teachers.

Her "Na Lei Hulu Makua, Na Wahine Hawai'i" tape of 1986 is one of the alltime Hawaiian blockbusters, and it's no less than a crime that that's not available on CD (come on Prism Records, get your act in gear! tapes are also hard, if not impossible, to find!). The music, harmony, and songs on this CD are a real treasure to anyone who likes contemporary Hawaiian music.Read more0Comment|

These are gentle, melodic, and sometimes haunting songs.  I think of them as a lullabies for adults.  Close your eyes, and you're in the Islands!Read more0Comment|
