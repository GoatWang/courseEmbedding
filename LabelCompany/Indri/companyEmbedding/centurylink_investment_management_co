Stay Ahead of the Cybersecurity Curve

 


Today, your organization is caught between an ever-growing number of smart, sophisticated cyber attacks and an army of hyper-connected customers, employees, suppliers and partners who simply expect access to information any time, from anywhere. This perfect storm of increasing threats and the new digital economy creates serious risks for your business—a single security breach can cost millions and do irreparable damage to your brand and reputation. So how do you satisfactorily address the risk, and in doing so satisfy the Board, when you may lack the staff resources and expertise, the technology or increased budget? Spending more and more on new security technology just isn’t getting the job done.
CenturyLink can help—by combining best-in-class security technology with the human resources, expertise and proven processes you need to keep every layer of your business and IT infrastructure secure and compliant. We’ll help you improve your posture while controlling the expense by focusing your spending on the right priorities. With CenturyLink, you can take advantage of:



































Market leading services evaluated by IDC and Forrester Research that fill your security skills gap, reduce complexity and improve quality of protection. The Forrester Wave™: Managed Security Services Providers, North America, Q3 2016 report ranked CenturyLink as a strong performer and a leader— surpassing both Verizon and AT&T. CenturyLink was named as one of only two Market Leaders in the IDC MarketScape: U.S. Emerging Managed Security Services 2016 Vendor Assessment.













































A complete, unified system of security services from a single partner that covers all the layers of your IT stack, delivering pragmatic solutions to the real threats of today with an emphasis on early detection and faster remediation, while preparing you for the new threats of tomorrow












































A predictable opex pricing model that maximizes the value of every security dollar you spend.












































Flexible, modular services that integrate easily into your security framework, so you can leverage existing investments and use your security tools more effectively. Services range from consulting engagements, to self-managed or fully managed services to full outsourcing, and they partner perfectly with CenturyLink network, colocation, managed hosting and cloud services.












































Transparent dashboards and reports that provide visibility, present actionable insights and prioritize risks in a single pane of glass. This allows you and our security experts to quickly assess your security posture in real time and initiate appropriate action to any incidents.












































Robust sources of global threat intelligence, including analysis of 20% of the world’s Internet traffic carried on the CenturyLink network.













































 A team of highly qualified cyber security experts to complement or offload tasks from your in-house security team, so you can stay focused on your core business.












































Enterprise-scale, 24/7/365 threat monitoring and incident response that can detect and remediate security incidents before they harm your organization.

Evolving your security with the threat landscape




Some of the most effective preventative security measures are relatively straight-forward to address with the right staff, expertise and knowledge of the threat landscape. By closing gaps and staying on top of known vulnerabilities, timely patching, effective endpoint protection and tighter authentication, you can significantly reduce the chance of exploitation.

Software issues are responsible for 90 percent of IT failure and breaches
The top 10 vulnerabilities account for 85% of successful exploit traffic
63% of confirmed data breaches involved weak, default or stolen passwords
More than 3/4 of mobile applications were projected to fail basic security tests by the end of 2015

Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!

Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function

Stay Ahead of the Cybersecurity Curve

 


Today, your organization is caught between an ever-growing number of smart, sophisticated cyber attacks and an army of hyper-connected customers, employees, suppliers and partners who simply expect access to information any time, from anywhere. This perfect storm of increasing threats and the new digital economy creates serious risks for your business—a single security breach can cost millions and do irreparable damage to your brand and reputation. So how do you satisfactorily address the risk, and in doing so satisfy the Board, when you may lack the staff resources and expertise, the technology or increased budget? Spending more and more on new security technology just isn’t getting the job done.
CenturyLink can help—by combining best-in-class security technology with the human resources, expertise and proven processes you need to keep every layer of your business and IT infrastructure secure and compliant. We’ll help you improve your posture while controlling the expense by focusing your spending on the right priorities. With CenturyLink, you can take advantage of:



































Market leading services evaluated by IDC and Forrester Research that fill your security skills gap, reduce complexity and improve quality of protection. The Forrester Wave™: Managed Security Services Providers, North America, Q3 2016 report ranked CenturyLink as a strong performer and a leader— surpassing both Verizon and AT&T. CenturyLink was named as one of only two Market Leaders in the IDC MarketScape: U.S. Emerging Managed Security Services 2016 Vendor Assessment.













































A complete, unified system of security services from a single partner that covers all the layers of your IT stack, delivering pragmatic solutions to the real threats of today with an emphasis on early detection and faster remediation, while preparing you for the new threats of tomorrow












































A predictable opex pricing model that maximizes the value of every security dollar you spend.












































Flexible, modular services that integrate easily into your security framework, so you can leverage existing investments and use your security tools more effectively. Services range from consulting engagements, to self-managed or fully managed services to full outsourcing, and they partner perfectly with CenturyLink network, colocation, managed hosting and cloud services.












































Transparent dashboards and reports that provide visibility, present actionable insights and prioritize risks in a single pane of glass. This allows you and our security experts to quickly assess your security posture in real time and initiate appropriate action to any incidents.












































Robust sources of global threat intelligence, including analysis of 20% of the world’s Internet traffic carried on the CenturyLink network.













































 A team of highly qualified cyber security experts to complement or offload tasks from your in-house security team, so you can stay focused on your core business.












































Enterprise-scale, 24/7/365 threat monitoring and incident response that can detect and remediate security incidents before they harm your organization.

Evolving your security with the threat landscape




Some of the most effective preventative security measures are relatively straight-forward to address with the right staff, expertise and knowledge of the threat landscape. By closing gaps and staying on top of known vulnerabilities, timely patching, effective endpoint protection and tighter authentication, you can significantly reduce the chance of exploitation.

Software issues are responsible for 90 percent of IT failure and breaches
The top 10 vulnerabilities account for 85% of successful exploit traffic
63% of confirmed data breaches involved weak, default or stolen passwords
More than 3/4 of mobile applications were projected to fail basic security tests by the end of 2015

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
