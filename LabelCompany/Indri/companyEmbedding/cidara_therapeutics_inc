Our Mission





Cidara seeks to save or improve patients’ lives through the development of anti-infectives that transform the standard of care. Our initial portfolio is comprised of proprietary product candidates for the treatment of serious fungal and bacterial infections.
There is an urgent and growing need not only for improved anti-infectives but also for entirely new therapeutic approaches to treat and prevent fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens, particularly those that are increasingly resistant to available treatments.








  





CD101 IV





CD101 IV is a novel echinocandin antifungal with potent activity against Candida, Aspergillus and PCP. We are developing CD101 IV for once weekly use in treatment and prophylaxis. We are currently conducting an international Phase 2 trial (STRIVE) in candidemia and invasive candidiasis.

Business Summary
Cidara is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new anti-infectives that have the potential to transform the standard of care and save or improve patients’ lives. The company is currently advancing its novel echinocandin antifungal, CD101 IV, through Phase 2 and developing CD201, its bispecific antimicrobial immunotherapy, for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. CD101 IV has enhanced potency and is the only once-weekly therapy intended for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. CD201 is the first drug candidate selected from Cidara’s novel Cloudbreak™ platform, the first immunotherapy discovery platform designed specifically to create compounds that direct a patient’s immune cells to attack and eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens. Cidara is headquartered in San Diego, California.

Pipeline
We are developing a balanced pipeline of product and development candidates with a focus on serious fungal and bacterial infections. Our lead product candidate, CD101 IV, is a novel echinocandin antifungal with enhanced potency and the only once-weekly therapy intended for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. In addition, we have created our proprietary Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform to generate new development candidates that will expand and diversify our pipeline. View our pipeline >>













  







  





CD101 IV
CD101 IV is a novel molecule in the echinocandin class of antifungals. We are initially developing CD101 IV for the treatment of systemic Candida infections. These infections include candidemia and related cases of invasive candidiasis, fungal infections associated with high mortality rates. The current treatment alternatives for systemic fungal infections, including polyenes, azoles, and currently approved echinocandins, have limitations that may be addressed by novel antifungals. Despite these limitations, annual sales for systemic antifungals are approximately $4.0 billion dollars globally.
CD101 IV exhibits a high exposure early in the course of infection and prolonged half-life which, in contrast to all other echinocandins, allows for once-weekly front-loaded IV therapy and convenient outpatient dosing. We believe that this pharmacokinetic profile may overcome the limitations of the current standard of care by:




Allowing single-agent treatment in both inpatient and outpatient settings
Facilitating shorter and less costly hospital stays
Offering the potential ability to treat less-susceptible pathogens and enhance tissue penetration at the site of infection
Providing more convenient outpatient echinocandin treatment and prophylaxis regimens
Improving compliance for outpatients




We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials for CD101 IV: a single ascending dose trial (SAD) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial. We are currently conducting an international Phase 2 clinical trial in candidemia called STRIVE. We expect results from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2017. Learn more about CD101 IV >>










CD101 IV Half-Life





PK measurements marked with an asterisk are from assays conducted by us. Other values are from studies published by third parties. Preclinical and clinical results to date demonstrate that a single dose of CD101 IV can provide sufficient drug exposure for a period of seven days.






  







  





Cloudbreak™ Immunotherapy Platform
Our proprietary Cloudbreak immunotherapy discovery platform has the potential to do for infectious disease what immunotherapy has done for cancer. Cloudbreak is a fundamentally new approach for the treatment of infectious disease which redirects the immune system to destroy fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens.
The design of the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform recognizes that most infectious disease is due to a temporary deficiency in the function of the immune system. Our Cloudbreak candidates are designed to address this deficiency by recruiting components of the patient’s immune system to the site of infection. Cloudbreak supports the engineering of bi-specific agents that target the pathogen and prime the immune system to generate a more effective anti-infective response.
We are developing initial Cloudbreak candidates for the treatment of serious gram-negative bacterial infections. Learn more about the Cloudbreak Platform >>











Each Cloudbreak candidate has two components that are joined by a chemical linker: a targeting moiety (TM) that recognizes a cell surface target and an effector moiety (EM) that is recognized by the immune system. The coupling of the TM to the EM results in a bispecific molecule that can direct the immune system specifically to the targeted pathogen.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE









	Cidara Provides Corporate Update and Reports First Quarter 2017




	Financial Results









	SAN DIEGO, May 10, 2017


	 – Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDTX), a biotechnology company developing novel anti-infectives including immunotherapies, today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and provided an update on its corporate activities and product pipeline.









	“We are excited about the progress we are making on our CD101 IV and Cloudbreak™ programs, which we discussed at our recent investor day,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara. “We anticipate announcing topline data from our STRIVE Phase 2 trial of CD101 IV in the fourth quarter, and are advancing CD201 through IND-enabling studies. Our financial position remains strong, and I look forward to providing an update on our continued progress as the year unfolds.”









	First Quarter 2017 and Subsequent Highlights


















	•






	Presented Data at ECCMID and SID Annual Meetings:


	In April 2017, Cidara presented data from nonclinical studies of its novel echinocandin antifungal CD101 and its Cloudbreak antibacterial immunotherapy CD201 at the 27th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Vienna, Austria, and at the 2017 Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) Annual Meeting in Portland, Oregon.
















	•






	Awarded Grant for up to $6.9 Million from CARB-X:


	 In March 2017, Cidara received a grant for up to $6.9 million from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Accelerator) to advance the development of its antibiotic immunotherapy, CD201, for the treatment of life-threatening multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections. CD201 is the first development candidate to be generated by Cidara’s novel Cloudbreak immunotherapy discovery platform, designed to create compounds that direct a patient’s immune cells to attack and eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens.












































	First Quarter 2017 Financial Results













	•






	Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $90.1 million as of March 31, 2017, compared with $104.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Management continues to expect cash burn of $60 to $65 million for 2017.





















	•






	Research and development expenses were $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to clinical development activities for CD101.





















	•






	General and administrative expenses were $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related costs to support the growth of operating activities.





















	•






	Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $13.4 million, compared to a net loss of $9.8 million for the first quarter of 2016.





















	•






	As of April 30, 2017, Cidara had 16,806,042 common shares outstanding.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of novel anti-infectives for the treatment of diseases that
are inadequately addressed by current standard of care therapies. We are
developing a balanced pipeline of product and development candidates, with an
initial focus on serious fungal and bacterial infections. Our lead product
candidate is CD101 IV, an intravenous formulation of a novel echinocandin. CD101
IV is being developed as a once-weekly, high-exposure therapy for the treatment
and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. In addition, we are
developing CD201, our bispecific antimicrobial immunotherapy, for the treatment
of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. CD201 is the first development
candidate selected from our proprietary Cloudbreak(TM) platform, which is designed
to create compounds that direct a patient's immune system to attack and
eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens.  ... More ...
