TESTIMONIALS









 
 
 
 
​CANDIDATE - ANDY YOUNG
 
​"Over the last 6 months I was looking for a new role and came across Robert.  I can honestly say that he is the best recruiter I have met by a long way.  Whilst many recruiters get a bad name, Robert is completely different and a pleasure to deal with.  He sticks to his word and is never too busy to talk to you at any time of the day or night, including weekends.  He is proactive - understanding my skillset perfectly and putting me forward for positions that I was unaware of.  He is communicative - giving detailed briefing calls before every interview, followed up with emails summarising the format and requirements of the interviews, and debriefs after each one.  For both failed and successful interviews, his feedback was invaluable explaining what had been seen as my strengths and shortcomings.  Next time I am looking for a job or a new member of staff, Robert will be the first person I call."

​CANDIDATE - WILL DRESNER
 
​"I have known and worked with Robert for a number of years. Over this period, I used a different recruitment firms but found Robert and Baker Charles to be easily the best of these. Not only when I have been looking for roles but when I have needed insight or even contacts from his own network Robert has been my point of call. He is a true market specialist who genuinely cares about his candidates and only focusing on Finance makes it a very worthwhile partnership. Through Robert, I secured my CFO role at Secretsales.When I have been looking for new roles, Robert has always been very knowledgeable about finance, the role he was recruiting for, detailed market knowledge and illustrated a superb insight into the companies I was interviewing for. Robert’s advice and preparation prior and during the interview process plus, at offer stage was second to none. He is extremely diligent, effective and transparent which is why we have such a strong relationship. I do trust him implicitly.I would have no hesitation in recommending Robert or Baker Charles to others employers or prospective candidates."

Baker Charles
This is a 2' x 6' guinea pig home I made last weekend for my neighbors three children. Made from ripped 4x4's cut on my portable table saw, cut to length with my miter saw, and sanded real smooth.  No splinters can be present as there will be many little arms running along the sides trying to catch the pets.

Description
Reviews (1)The historic Hotel Baker is a charming and glamorous hotel with a history of the paranormal. According to local legends, a chambermaid who was employed at the hotel drowned herself in the Fox River when she was jilted by her lover on the altar.  Another version of the story says that the maid’s lover was also an employee of the hotel and that he left her after a night of poker. The chambermaids’ quarters were originally located on the 6th floor and it has been converted into a penthouse suite. Guests who have checked in the 6th floor penthouse have reported hearing strange voices and having their bedding pulled by an unseen force.HistoryThe historic Hotel Baker is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been in and out of business since 1928. In 1926, Col. Baker envisioned a hotel which was luxurious and which would give people an escape or relaxation. The hotel was built on the site of an old mill which was destroyed by fire in 1991. The hotel was built with an operating hydroelectric facility, a modern phone system, a parking garage, a radio station and a rose garden. However, the garage was demolished in the 1970s.The hotel was finally opened to the public on June 2, 1928 and rooms back then only cost $2.50 per night. The fifth floor of the hotel was reserved as luxurious apartments with open patios. The most famous feature of the hotel was the Rainbow Room, a room which was originally the hotel’s ballroom and restaurant. Famous personalities such as Guy Lombardo, Eddie Duchin, Louis Armstrong and Lawrence Welkhave danced on the hotel’s ballroom.AboutPeople planning a weekend getaway, a conference, a party, a banquet or a wedding can be assured that they would have all of their needs met when coming to the Hotel Baker. The hotel’s banquet facilities can accommodate groups as small as 10 and as large as 300 people. The hotel’s charming rose garden and outdoor patio dining makes a memorable setting for weddings and other parties. Guests and celebrants can be assured that everything they want will be done with the highest level of service and attention to detail.Hotel Baker has 53 guest rooms which are tastefully furnished. Each of the rooms has marble-accented baths, plush carpeting, individual climate controls and custom draperies. Most of the furnishings found in the hotel were the same original pieces used on the hotel in 1928. Guests who want a satisfying meal will find themselves satisfied when going to Rox City Grill. The sleek and elegant dining destination offers incomparable creations from Chef David Hassan. The hotel is open nightly and offers live entertainment from Thursday to Saturday.FeaturesCable televisionCoffee makerPhone with 2 linesData portsComplimentary newspaperIron and ironing boardConcierge serviceFitness centerComplimentary deluxe continental breakfastLaundry and dry cleaning serviceThings to DoRegardless what month you choose to visit St. Charles, you will find a wide variety of attractions which are waiting to be explored.
