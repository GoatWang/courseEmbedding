About - Boomer Venture Summit










































































        



























About Us 
Today’s older adults are more active than their predecessors and they have very different interests and motivations. Consequently, baby boomers and older adults are demanding products and services from an economy that is not prepared to meet their needs. This presents a tremendous window of opportunity for unprecedented profits and growth, even in a challenging economic climate. With the right business plan, direction and commitment to succeed, entrepreneurs are poised to help increase the quality of life for many while creating a successful business in the process.
Since 2004, Mary Furlong & Associates has produced the Silicon Valley Boomer Venture Summit and Business Plan Competition and each year has been more successful than the one before. This year, to coordinate with the IAGG event in San Francisco, we bring the Boomer Venture Summit to The Claremont Club and Spa in the hills of Berkeley, California. 
The event brings together entrepreneurs, leaders in the field of aging and the venture community to create a unique forum to explore, share and design products and services that will dominate the baby boomer market in coming years. In addition, this program is designed to teach entrepreneurs how to think through a business.
Mary Furlong & Associates, Executive Producer

Andy Cohen Caring.com - Boomer Venture Summit









































































        




























Andy Cohen Caring.com









Andy Cohen is the co-founder and CEO of Caring.com. While caring for his mom during her losing battle with lung cancer, Andy realized that there wasn’t a comprehensive website to help people figure out how to navigate all of the challenges of caring for aging parents. Andy founded Caring.com in 2007 to help make a difficult journey a little bit easier.
With three million unique visitors every month, Caring.com is the leading online destination for family members who are caring for aging loved ones. Caring.com provides objective information, a community of support and a local senior services directory that features 100,000 consumer reviews. Caring.com has been written about in USA Today, The Wall St. Journal, The New York Times, Money Magazine and Business Week. In May, 2014, Caring.com was purchased for $54 million by Bankrate, Inc.
Prior to founding Caring.com, Andy held leadership positions in marketing and sales at SC Johnson Wax, Intuit, Instill, Peapod and SuccessFactors, where he grew businesses from start-up to tens of millions of dollars in revenue.   Andy is a frequent speaker on caregiving topics, and serves on the board of directors of the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC).   Andy earned a B.A. in history from Stanford University and an M.B.A. in marketing from Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management.

We will apply the proceeds from the Offering to pay for accounting fees, legal
and professional fees associated with this Offering and partially to the
development of the search engine. We will pay all costs relating to this
Offering.

The table below shows the intended net proceeds from this offering we expect to
receive for scenarios where we sell various amounts of the shares. Since we are
making this offering without any minimum requirement, there is no guarantee that
we will be successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this
prospectus. Accordingly, the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this
offering, if any, may differ.

* If we are successful in raising 100% of the funds sought, we will be able to
  increase our administrative costs to raise efficiency of our business.

^ We will utilize funds currently in our account to ensure that we will be able
  to develop the proposed search engine.

Our offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses and
printing costs. The minimum amount of accounting and legal expenses we
anticipate in the first year following the effective date would be $2,000. Our
Officers and Directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in
selling our shares.

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering in the manner set forth above. In
the event that we do not raise the entire amount we seek to raise, and are
unable to generate revenues to raise that amount, then we may cut back on some
of the costs (such as travel and development costs), or we may attempt to raise
additional funds via private placements or sales of securities to or loans from
our Directors in order to make up any shortfall. The most immediate use of funds
will be the development of the proposed search engine. The second critical
element would be retention of employees. Travel, legal and accounting will be
the first line items to be reduced if the required funding is not raised. If we
are successful in raising 100% of the funds sought we will primarily focus on
completing the development of the first version of the proposed search engine.

We believe that the minimum net offering receivables we require to fund our
activity for the next twelve months is $10,000. Coupled with cash on hand, that
will enable us to develop the proposed search engine. If we are not successful
in raising sufficient funds to fully develop the proposed search engine, we will
need to raise funds from our Director.

We do not have any agreements in place with our Directors to provide loans to
the company if needed. We do not intend to use the proceeds to finance the
acquisition of other businesses. At present, no material changes are
contemplated. Should there be any material changes in the projected use of
proceeds in connection with this offering, we will issue an amended prospectus
reflecting the new uses.

In all instances, after the effectiveness of this Registration Statement, the
Company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general
existence and comply with its public reporting obligations. In addition to
changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received, we may change
the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business plan. Investors
should understand that we will exercise discretion over the use of proceeds to
ensure that funds are used to advance the development of the Company’s website
and or proposed search engine. Therefore, management decisions may not be in
line with the initial objectives of investors, who will have little ability to
influence these decisions.


Boomer’s chief competition comes from the search engine industry, which is
rapidly growing. As a result, the number and sophistication of competitors are
also rapidly growing. We hope to distinguish ourselves from these competitors by
the combination of services we offer, the high quality of our website and
technology, and our focus on our core demographic.

There are numerous travel search websites on the Internet such as Kayak and
Hotwire. We hope to distinguish ourselves by utilizing a deep search engine to
uncover all available travel options that might be overlooked by popular travel
search websites.

The Deep Web is a World Wide Web content that is not part of the Surface Web,
which is indexed by standard search engines which are considered as our
competitors. Mike Bergman, founder of BrightPlanet and credited with coining the
phrase, said that searching (standard search engines) on the Internet today can
be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean; a great deal may
be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and
therefore missed. Most of the Web’s information is buried far down on
dynamically generated sites, and standard traditional search engines used by our
competitors do not find it. Standard traditional search engines cannot see or
retrieve content in the deep Web.

Our Company will attempt to design and create a search engine that will search
all of the relevant sites to expose the best deals – the closest thing to a
one-stop experience. Our search engine will have the ability to crawl the deep
web whereas the current competitor’s standard search engines do not have such
access into the deep web.


Company Description
We were incorporated in Nevada on July 6, 2012 under the name Boomer Ventures 
Inc. We intend to develop a deep Internet search engine that uncovers the best 
deals on the Internet. The proposed search engine’s objectives are to allow 
users to uncover deals and websites that are usually overlooked


 by regular 
search engines. It is too time consuming to check every website for travel, 
used cars, real estate, coupons etc with this proposed deep search engine all 
relevant sites are searched to expose the best deals. We have not yet commenced 
the development of our website, began any proposed business operations, and 
completion of the search engine is not a certainty. We anticipate that our 
revenues will be chiefly derived from sales of advertising, sponsorships of 
our Internet website, and fees for premium services paid by our users.
