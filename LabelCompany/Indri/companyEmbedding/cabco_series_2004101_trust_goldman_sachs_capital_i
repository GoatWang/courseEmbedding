                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(a) The Trust is hereby created under the laws of the State of New
York for the benefit of the Certificateholders. The assets of the Trust shall
consist of:


(i) the securities described in Exhibit A, exclusive of the
Retained Interest, which are being Granted, transferred and sold to the
Trustee by the Depositor simultaneously with the execution of this

pursuant to Section 2.14 (in which event Exhibit A shall be amended to
reflect the amount and date of such Grant), and;


(ii) all right, title and interest in and to the distributions
on the Underlying Securities after the date of this Agreement, exclusive
of the Retained Interest, including any distributions on any additional
Underlying Securities Granted to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.14
(subject to the Trust's obligations to the Swap Counterparty under the
Swap Agreement); and


(iii) the rights of the Trust under the Swap Agreement
(subject to the Trust's obligations to the Swap Counterparty under the
Swap Agreement).


The securities described in Exhibit A, exclusive of the Retained
Interest, as amended after the Closing Date to reflect any subsequent Grant of
additional Underlying Securities Granted to the Trustee pursuant to Section
2.14, are referred to in this Agreement as the "Underlying Securities". The
Trustee shall hold the assets of the Trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, subject to the obligations of the Trust, if any.


(b) The parties acknowledge that UBS Securities LLC, as the initial
purchaser, and then sole holder, of the Certificates, has granted the Call
Options to the Depositor under the Call Option Agreement, and the Depositor
intends to sell the Call Options, through UBS Securities LLC as Placement Agent
under the Placement Agency Agreement, to the Swap Counterparty. By its purchase
of a Certificate, (i) each Certificateholder agrees to assume the obligation to
perform the related Call Option on the terms and conditions contained in the
Call Option Agreement, permitting the Option Holder or its assignee to purchase
such Certificate at the Call Price and at the times specified in such Call
Option Agreement and (ii) each Certificateholder that purchases a Certificate
directly from the Underwriter agrees to make the "integration election" set
forth in

Agent to act on its behalf with respect to the related Call Option under this

Certificate, the transferor of the Certificate shall be released from its
obligation to perform the related Call Option, and the transferor's appointment

be assigned by the holder thereof if the holder assigns all of the Call Options
by transfer in accordance with the terms thereof to any person other than to the
Depositor. The Call Options are not obligations of or securities issued by the

and the Option Agent to the extent set forth in the Call Option Agreement;

Certificate, that following an exercise of a Call Option in compliance with the
Call Option Agreement, the Trustee shall treat the Option Holder as the
Certificateholder thereof, and distribute the Underlying Securities to the
Option Holder, as provided in Section 2.15 hereof.


(c) The Depositor, concurrently with the execution and delivery
hereof, does hereby Grant to the Trustee, on behalf and for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and without recourse, all the right, title and interest of
the Depositor in, to and under the Underlying Securities, now existing or
hereafter acquired and all other assets included or to be included in the Trust
for the benefit of the Certificateholders. The Grant will include all interest,
premium (if any) and principal received by or on behalf of the Depositor of, on
or with respect to any Underlying Securities due after the Closing Date,
exclusive of the Retained Interest, which has not been Granted to the Trustee.

Securities to the Trustee through the facilities of DTC, and the Trustee shall
accept delivery of the Underlying Securities and shall credit the Underlying
Securities to a trust account of the Trustee, or its authorized agent.

under this Section 2.14, upon at least three (3) Business Days' written notice
to the Trustee, and subject to (a) satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition,

(b) the prior consent of the Swap Counterparty and (c) delivery of an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the sale of such additional Underlying Securities and
the issuance of additional Certificates as provided in this Section 2.14 would
not adversely affect the intended classification of the Trust as a grantor trust
for federal income tax purposes. Such transfer, sale and issuance shall be
evidenced by a cross-receipt between the Depositor and the Trustee. Upon such
transfer and sale to the Trust, (a) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver
to the Depositor, or its order, Certificates in the same relative proportions as
the Certificates issued on the Closing Date, and with an aggregate initial
Certificate Principal Balance equal to the aggregate principal amount of such
additional Underlying Securities, provided that the aggregate Certificate
Principal Balance of


16





additional Certificates shall be greater than or equal to $15,000,000, (b) UBS
Securities LLC, as the initial purchaser from the Depositor, and then sole
holder, of the Certificates shall grant a Call Option in respect of each
Certificate to the Depositor, and the Option Agent shall execute and deliver to
the Depositor, and the Trustee shall acknowledge, such Call Options on such
additional Certificates, and (c) the Depositor shall either use reasonable
commercial endeavors (directly or through UBS Securities LLC), immediately after
the grant of such Call Options, to sell such Call Options to the same entity
that then holds the Call Options on the existing Certificates or ensure that the
issuance of the additional Certificates and the related Call Options shall not
affect the right of the holder of the existing Call Options to exercise its Call
Options at any time. Each condition to be satisfied with respect to a sale of
Underlying Securities on the Closing Date shall be satisfied with respect to a
sale of additional Underlying Securities on the date of sale thereof, each
representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement to be made on the
Closing Date shall be deemed made (with respect to such additional Underlying
Securities, if applicable) on such date of sale, and from and after such date of
sale, all additional Underlying Securities held by the Trustee shall be held on
the same terms and conditions as the Underlying Securities Granted on the
Closing Date. Any such additional Certificates authenticated and delivered shall
have the same terms and rank pari passu with the Certificates previously issued
in accordance with this Agreement, and any such additional Call Options shall
have the same terms as the Call Options previously granted in accordance with
the Call Option Agreement.


Section 2.15. Call Options, Exercise of Call Options and Exchange of
Certificates for Underlying Securities.


(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, U.S. Bank
Trust National Association, as Option Agent, shall execute the Call Option
Agreement and the Call Options, dated as of the date hereof, evidencing all of
the Call Options.


(b) Pursuant to the Call Option Agreement, the Option Agent must
notify the Trustee immediately upon its receipt of a Call Notice. If the number
of Certificates specified in such Call Notice is less than the outstanding
number of Certificates the Trustee shall select the Certificates to be purchased
under the Call Options as follows: the Certificates selected by the Trustee
shall be a pro rata portion of the Certificates held by each Certificateholder,
provided that purchases of a fraction of a single Certificate shall not be made
and the Trustee shall round up or down the number of Certificates to be
purchased from each Certificateholder to avoid such fractional purchases.


(c) Upon a Call Date with respect to the exercise of the Call
Options and upon notification to the Trustee by the Option Agent of the receipt
of the Call Price by the Option Agent and the satisfaction of the conditions
specified in the Call Option Agreement, (i) the Certificates acquired pursuant
to the exercise of the Call Options (the "Called Certificates") shall be
transferred to the Option Holder, and (ii) if the Call Options are exercised in
connection with a tender offer, the Trustee will distribute, out of the tender
offer proceeds, the Call Price to the Certificateholders of Called Certificates
and the Option Agent will pay to the Option Holder the amount that the tender
proceeds exceeds the Call Price, if any. The parties acknowledge that, pursuant
to the Call Option Agreement, the Call Notice shall automatically expire (i) if
the Call Options are being exercised other than in connection with a tender
offer, and the Option Holder has not paid the Call Price to the Option Agent by
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Call Date,


17





or (ii) in the case of a tender offer, if the Trustee has not received payment
of the Call Price from the Underlying Securities Issuer or other purchaser by
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the later of (A) the date specified for
settlement in the Call Notice, or (B) the earlier to occur of the date
immediately following the date on which the tender offer is consummated or the
date on which it expired unconsummated, and that, in such event, none of the
Option Holder, the Option Agent or the Trustee shall have any obligation with
respect to the Call Notice, and the expiration of a Call Notice shall in no way
affect the Option Holder's right to deliver a Call Notice at a later date.


(d) Unless the Call Options are exercised in connection with a
tender offer, following payment of the Call Price, the Option Agent shall remit
the Call Price to the Trustee, and subject to the following sentence, the
Trustee shall distribute the Call Price to Certificateholders of Called
Certificates. However, Certificateholders holding Called Certificates in
definitive physical form (other than DTC) shall not be entitled to be paid the
Call Price for such Called Certificates until such Called Certificates have been
presented and surrendered to the Trustee. If any Certificateholder shall not
surrender its Call Certificates that are in definitive physical form for
cancellation within six months after the Call Date, the Trustee shall give a
second written notice to such remaining Certificateholders to surrender their
Called Certificates that are in definitive physical form for cancellation and
receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within one year after
the second notice any of the Called Certificates that are in definitive physical
form shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee may take
appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact
the applicable Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Called
Certificates that are in definitive physical form, and the cost thereof shall be
paid out of the Call Price in respect of such Called Certificates.


(e) Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of such Certificate,

(i) irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Option Agent to carry out as
attorney-in-fact of such Certificateholder the actions provided by this
Agreement or the Call Option Agreement to be carried out by such
Certificateholder or by the Option Agent as such attorney-in-fact, (ii) agrees
to assume and be bound by the terms and provisions of the related Call Option
and covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Call Option, and

(iii) consents to the provisions of the Call Option Agreement.


(f) Upon any transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall assume
and be bound by the terms of the related Call Option and the Call Option
Agreement (without the requirement of any further action on the part of such
transferee), and the transferor shall be released from its obligations under the
related Call Option and such agreement, and the transferor's appointment of U.S.
Bank Trust National Association as its Option Agent with respect thereto shall
thereupon terminate (in each case without the requirement of any further action
on the part of such transferor).


(g) This Section 2.15 shall not provide the Option Holder with a
lien against, an interest in or a right to specific performance with respect to
the Underlying Securities; provided that satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 2.15(c) shall entitle the Option Holder, as applicable, to a
distribution of the proceeds from the liquidation of the Underlying Securities.


18





(h) The rights of the Certificateholders under this Agreement and
the Certificates are subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of this
Agreement, the Call Option Agreement and the Call Options.


(i) (i) If the Trustee receives any announcement or proposal of an
amendment to the Underlying Securities Trust Agreement or the Underlying
Securities or a notice of redemption of, tender offer for or other unscheduled
repayment on or repurchase of some or all of the Underlying Securities, the
Trustee shall within two Business Days notify the Option Agent and send to the
Option Agent copies of all materials received by the Trustee in connection
therewith. If in connection with a tender offer for the Underlying Securities
the Trustee receives a Call Notice from the Option Holder, no later than seven
Business Days prior to the expiration of the tender offer acceptance period,
that the Option Holder desires to exercise Call Options in connection with the
consummation of any such tender offer, then the Trustee shall tender, in
compliance with the tender offer requirements, a principal amount of Underlying
Securities equal to the amount of Certificates subject to such Call Options;
provided, that the Trustee shall not so tender unless the tender offer price
shall equal or exceed the applicable Call Price.


(ii) The Call Date for any exercise of Call Options in
connection with a tender offer shall be deemed to be the Business Day on
which such Underlying Securities are accepted for payment and paid for, if
such payment occurs on or before 1:00 p.m., and the following Business Day
if such payment occurs after 1:00 p.m.


(iii) On the Call Date, the Call Price shall be deducted from
the tender offer proceeds and paid to Certificateholders by the Trustee on
behalf of the Option Agent, and the excess of the tender offer proceeds
over the Call Price shall be paid to the Option Holder.


(iv) If fewer than all tendered Underlying Securities are
accepted for payment and paid for, (A) the Call Options deemed exercised
shall be reduced so that the Certificate Principal Balance of the Called
Certificates corresponds to the principal amount of Underlying Securities
accepted for payment and paid for; and (B) the Call Options not exercised
shall remain outstanding.


(v) If (A) the tender offer is terminated by the Underlying
Securities Issuer or any other tender offeror without consummation
thereof, (B) all tenders by the Trust of Underlying Securities are
otherwise rejected or (C) the Trustee shall not have received payment of
the tender price from the Underlying Securities Issuer or other purchaser
of the Underlying Securities in immediately available funds by 10:00 a.m.
on the later of (x) the date specified for settlement in the Call Notice,
or (y) the earlier to occur of the date immediately following the date on
which the tender offer is consummated or the date on which it expires
unconsummated, then (1) the Call Notice will be of no further force and
effect, and (2) the Call Options will be deemed not exercised and will
remain outstanding.


(vi) The parties acknowledge that under the Call Option
Agreement, if Underlying Securities are redeemed in part by the Underlying
Securities Issuer and the Option Holder does not exercise Call Options
with respect to all the Underlying Securities


19





redeemed in such partial redemption, the number of Call Options held by
the Option Holder shall be reduced proportionately so that the aggregate
amount of Certificates callable by the exercise of Call Options shall
equal the amount of outstanding Certificates after giving effect to such
partial redemption.


Section 2.16. The Swap Agreement and Swap Payments.


(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Depositor
shall execute the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which the Depositor shall
assign its rights and obligations (excluding the one-time payment paid by the
Depositor to the Swap Counterparty under the Confirmation) under the
Confirmation to the Trust.


(b) Once the Confirmation has been assigned to the Trust, pursuant
to the Swap Agreement, the Trust shall pay to the Swap Counterparty for so long
as the Swap Agreement shall not have been terminated, all interest payments
(including any accrued and unpaid interest and any interest on such accrued and
unpaid interest) paid to the Trust in respect of the Underlying Securities on
the date such amounts are received by the Trust, excluding the Retained
Interest.


(c) Once the Confirmation has been assigned to the Trust, pursuant
to the Swap Agreement, the Swap Counterparty shall pay to the Trust (i) for so
long as the Swap Agreement shall not have been terminated, on each Distribution
Date (other than a Distribution Date occurring during the continuance of an
Extension Period with respect to the Underlying Securities) and on the Final
Distribution Date, an amount equal to the Interest Distribution Amount for the
immediately preceding Interest Accrual Period, (ii) on any Distribution Date
accruing immediately following the end of any Extension Period, an amount equal
to the Deferred Interest and (iii) upon the termination of SEC reporting by the
Swap Counterparty and its failure to find a replacement counterparty, an amount
equal to (x) the accrued and unpaid interest on and the Certificate Principal
Balance of the Certificates less (y) the proceeds, resulting from the Trustee's
liquidation of the Underlying Securities, if it is a positive number.


(d) Once the Confirmation has been assigned to the Trust, pursuant
to the Swap Agreement, if a Swap Agreement Termination Event occurs in which the
Swap Counterparty is the "defaulting party" or the only "affected party" under
the Swap Agreement, the Trustee agrees to designate as an Early Termination Date
the earliest date following the Trustee's receipt of actual knowledge thereof on
which the Swap Agreement can practicably be terminated.


Section 2.17. Mergers.


The Trust shall not dissolve, liquidate, merge or consolidate with
any other trust, corporation, company or entity or sell any of its assets,
except as expressly provided herein, or acquire all or substantially all of the
assets or capital stock or other ownership interest of any other corporation,
company or entity.


Section 2.18. Grant of Security Interest.


(a) It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the
conveyance of the Underlying Securities by the Depositor to the Trustee be, and
be construed as, a sale of the


20





Underlying Securities by the Depositor and not a pledge of the Underlying
Securities by the Depositor to secure a debt or other obligation of the
Depositor.


(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the aforementioned intent of
the parties, any Underlying Securities are held to be property of the Depositor,
then (i) it is the express intent of the parties that such conveyance be deemed
a pledge of such Underlying Securities by the Depositor to the Trustee to secure
a debt or other obligation of the Depositor and (ii)(A) this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the
UCC; (B) the conveyance provided for in Section 2.1(a) shall be deemed to be a
Grant by the Depositor to the Trustee of a security interest in all the
Depositor's right, title and interest in and to such Underlying Securities and
all amounts payable to the holders of such Underlying Securities in accordance
with the terms hereof and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or
involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments, securities or other
property including all amounts from time to time held or invested in the
Collection Account, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or
other property; (C) the obligations secured by such security agreement shall be
deemed to be all the Depositor's obligations under this Agreement including the
obligation to provide to the Certificateholders the benefits of this Agreement
relating to the Underlying Securities and the Trust; and (D) notifications to
persons holding such property, and acknowledgements, receipts or confirmations
from persons holding such property shall be deemed notifications to,
acknowledgements, receipts or confirmations from, financial intermediaries,
bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Trustee for the purpose of perfecting
such security interest under applicable law.


In such event, the Depositor will be deemed to have hereby Granted
to the Trustee a security interest in the Underlying Securities and all other
property described in (ii)(B) of the preceding paragraph, for the purpose of
securing to the Trustee the performance by the Depositor of the obligations
described in clause (ii)(C) of the preceding paragraph.


(c) [Reserved].


(d) In connection with any such deemed grant of a security interest
in the Underlying Securities (including additional Underlying Securities
transferred to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.14),


(i) the Depositor hereby represents and warrants as follows:


(A) In the event the Underlying Securities are held to
be property of the Depositor, then this Agreement creates a valid
and continuing security interest (as defined in the UCC) in the
Underlying Securities in favor of the Trustee, which security
interest is prior to all other liens, and is enforceable as such as
against creditors of, and purchasers from, the Depositor. Under the
UCC as in effect on the date of this Agreement, if this Agreement
were deemed to create a security interest, the procedures specified
in this Agreement would be sufficient to maintain a first priority
lien on the Underlying Securities for so long as the Underlying
Securities remain outstanding;


21





(B) Immediately prior to the transfer of the Underlying
Securities to the Trust, Depositor owned and had good and marketable
title to the Underlying Securities free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance of any Person;


(C) Depositor has not assigned, pledged, sold, granted a
security interest in or otherwise conveyed any interest in the
Underlying Securities (or, if any such interest has been assigned,
pledged or otherwise encumbered, it has been released). Depositor
has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing
statements against Depositor that includes a description of the
Underlying Securities. Depositor is not aware of any judgment or tax
lien filings against Depositor;


(D) Depositor has not consented to the compliance by the
Securities Intermediary with entitlement orders of any Person other
than the Trustee, as trustee of the Trust; and


(ii) the Trustee hereby represents and warrants as follows:


(A) It has taken all steps necessary to cause the
Securities Intermediary for the Securities Account to identify on
its records that the Trustee, as the trustee for the Trust, is the
Person having a security entitlement against the Securities
Intermediary in the Securities Account;


(B) The Underlying Securities have been credited to a
trust account (the "Securities Account") of the Trustee, or its
authorized agent, in accordance with Section 6.1. The Trustee, as
Securities Intermediary for the Securities Account, has agreed to
treat the Underlying Securities as "financial assets" within the
meaning of the UCC; and


(C) The Securities Account is not in the name of any
Person other than the Trustee.



ARTICLE III




THE CERTIFICATES



Section 3.1. The Certificates.


(a) The Certificates shall be issued in one Class and shall have the
terms set forth in this Agreement. The Certificates shall be issued in
substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C to this Agreement, with such
changes as shall be approved by the Depositor and the Trustee, such approval to
be manifested by the execution and authentication thereof by the Trustee. The
Certificates shall evidence the entire undivided beneficial ownership of the
assets of the Trust, subject to the liabilities of the Trust (if any), and
amounts distributable in respect of the


22





Certificates shall be payable solely from payments or property received by the
Trustee on or in respect of the Underlying Securities, after satisfaction of
such liabilities (if any).


(b) Each of the Certificates shall be issued in denominations of
$25.00 and integral multiples of $25.00 in excess thereof. Purchases and
redemptions of a fraction of a single Certificate shall not be permitted.


The Certificates shall have an initial aggregate Certificate
Principal Balance of $150,000,000. Each of the Certificateholders shall be
entitled to a distribution of principal (and any premium) on the Final
Distribution Date (or any Underlying Securities Payment Date on which principal
or premium is paid), to the extent of principal payments made on the Underlying
Securities (including any premium) on such date.


(c) The holders of the Certificates shall be entitled to receive on
each Distribution Date an amount equal to the related Interest Distribution
Amount; provided, however, that during the continuance of an Extension Period
with respect to the Underlying Securities, interest will continue to accrue on
the Certificate Principal Balance (and on any interest that is due), but such
interest will not be distributed to the Certificateholders until the Extension
Period ends.


Section 3.2. Form of the Certificates.


(a) The Certificates shall initially be issued in one or more global
certificates in fully registered form, in the name of Cede & Co., nominee of
DTC, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C. The Trustee, upon receipt
of a Depositor Order to that effect, shall cause such Certificates to be
executed and authenticated as provided in Section 3.3 concurrently with the sale
of the Underlying Securities to the Trust upon written order of the Depositor.
Each Certificate may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification
as the Depositor and the Trustee may determine. All Certificates shall be
identical in all respects except for the denominations thereof and, if
applicable, the name of the registered Certificateholder and the number of the
Certificate. All Certificates issued under this Agreement shall be in all
respects equally and ratably entitled to the benefits of this Agreement, without
preference, priority or distinction on account of the actual time or times of
authentication and delivery, all in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.


(b) The terms of the form of certificate set forth in Exhibit C to
this Agreement shall form part of this Agreement.


Section 3.3. Execution, Authentication and Delivery.


The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual
or facsimile signature of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, pursuant to a
Depositor Order, and authenticated by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee.
Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were,
at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to execute
or authenticate Certificates on behalf of the Trust, shall be valid and binding
obligations of the Trust, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them
shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery
of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of authentication
and delivery of such Certificates. No Certificate shall entitle its holder


23





to any benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless
there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of authentication
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C, executed by the Trustee by
manual signature. Such authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that
such Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.


Section 3.4. Registration of Certificates; Registration of Transfer
and Exchange of Certificates.


(a) The registrar appointed by the Depositor (the "Certificate
Registrar") shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency of the Trust
maintained pursuant to Section 2.4, a register (the "Certificate Register") in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it shall
provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of
Certificates as provided herein; provided, however, that no Certificate may be
subdivided upon transfer or exchange such that the denomination of any resulting
Certificate is other than the authorized denominations specified in Section

3.1(b). The initial Certificate Registrar shall be the Trustee. Upon any
resignation of a Certificate Registrar, the Trustee shall promptly appoint a
successor or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume the duties of
Certificate Registrar.


(b) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate
at the Corporate Trust Office maintained pursuant to Section 2.4, the Trustee
shall execute on behalf of the Trust, and shall authenticate and deliver in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, as provided in Section 3.3,
one or more new Certificates, in authorized denominations and of a like
aggregate Certificate Principal Balance, dated the date of authentication by the
Trustee.


(c) At the option of a Certificateholder, Certificates may be
exchanged for other Certificates in authorized denominations and of a like
aggregate Certificate Principal Balance, upon surrender of the Certificates to
be exchanged at the office or agency of the Trust maintained pursuant to Section

2.4. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Trustee
shall execute on behalf of the Trust, and shall authenticate and deliver in the
name of the Certificateholder, one or more new Certificates dated the date of
authentication by the Trustee. Such Certificates shall be delivered to the
Certificateholder making the exchange.


(d) Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar, duly
executed by the Certificateholder or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer and exchange shall be
cancelled and subsequently destroyed by the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar
in accordance with its customary practice.


(e) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may
require the payment by the Certificateholder of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of Certificates.


24





(f) The provisions of Sections 7.1, 7.3, 7.8 and 7.10 shall apply to
the Trustee in its role as Certificate Registrar, for so long as the Trustee
shall act as Certificate Registrar.


Section 3.5. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.


(a) If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the
Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii)
there is delivered to the Certificate Registrar, the Trustee and the Depositor
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them
harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Certificate Registrar or the
Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired by a Protected Purchaser, the
Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust, and shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificate, a replacement Certificate and a like aggregate Certificate
Principal Balance; provided, however, that if any such mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Certificate shall have become or within seven days shall be due
and payable, then instead of issuing a replacement Certificate the Trustee may
pay such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate when so due or
payable.


(b) If, after the delivery of a replacement Certificate or payment
in respect of a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate pursuant to

Section 3.5(a), a Protected Purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of
which such replacement Certificate was issued presents for payment such original
Certificate, the Trustee shall be entitled to recover such replacement
Certificate or payment from the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person
taking such replacement Certificate from such Person to whom such replacement
Certificate was delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a Protected
Purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity
provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by
the Trustee in connection therewith.


(c) In connection with the issuance of any replacement Certificate
under this Section 3.5, the Trustee may require the payment by the
Certificateholder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses

(including the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar)
connected therewith.


(d) Any Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.5 in
replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall
represent ownership of a beneficial interest in the Trust Assets, and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with
any and all other Certificates duly issued hereunder.


(e) The provisions of this Section 3.5 are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates.


Section 3.6. Persons Deemed Certificateholders.


Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of
transfer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Depositor and their
respective employees, officers, agents and Affiliates may treat the Person in
whose name the Certificate is registered in the Certificate Register as the
Certificateholder of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions
pursuant to Articles


25





VI and VIII and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar, the Depositor and their respective employees, officers,
agents and Affiliates shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.


Section 3.7. Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and
Addresses.


(a) The Depositor shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Trustee on the Record Date before each Distribution Date, and at such other
times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list, in such form as the Trustee
may reasonably require, to the extent such information is in the possession or
control of the Depositor, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders
as of such Record Date; provided, however, that so long as the Trustee is the
Certificate Registrar, the Depositor shall not be required to furnish such list
to the Trustee. If the Trustee is the Certificate Registrar, upon written
request by the Depositor, the Trustee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
the Depositor, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such request, a list,
in such form as the Depositor may reasonably require, of the names and addresses
of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. Each
Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, shall be deemed to
have agreed not to hold any of the Depositor or the Trustee accountable by
reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from
which such information was derived.


(b) For purposes of determining the identity of Certificateholders
entitled to vote or in connection with any notice or other communication to be
provided to Certificateholders pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any
consent or other action to be taken by Certificateholders, the Trustee shall
establish a record date for such consent or other action and give each
Certificateholder notice of such record date not less than fifteen (15) calendar
days in advance of such record date to the extent possible. Such record date
shall be the later of thirty (30) days prior to the first solicitation of such
consent or other action and the date of the most recent list of
Certificateholders, if any, furnished to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.7(a).


Section 3.8. Preservation of Information; Communications to
Certificateholders.


(a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of the Certificateholders
contained in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in

Section 3.7(a), if any, and the names and addresses of Certificateholders
received by the Trustee in its capacity as Certificate Registrar. The Trustee
may destroy any list furnished to or prepared by it as provided in such Section
3.7(a) upon receipt or preparation of a new list.


(b) Certificateholders shall have the right to communicate pursuant
to Section 312(b) of the TIA with other Certificateholders with respect to their
rights under this Agreement or the Certificates, and the Trustee shall take such
action, from time to time, as may be required by the provisions of Section
312(b) of the TIA.


(c) The Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar shall
have the protection provided by Section 312(c) of the TIA.


26





Section 3.9. Legend on Global Certificates.


Each global Certificate for a Certificate shall bear the following
legend:


THIS CERTIFICATE IS A GLOBAL CERTIFICATE WITHIN THE MEANING OF
THE TRUST AGREEMENT HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED
IN THE NAME OF THE NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY
("DTC"), CEDE & CO. THIS CERTIFICATE IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR
CERTIFICATES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN DTC
OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN
THE TRUST AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A
WHOLE BY DTC OR BY A NOMINEE OF DTC TO DTC OR ANOTHER NOMINEE
OF DTC.


UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED
REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC TO THE TRUST OR ITS AGENT FOR
REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, OR PAYMENT, AND ANY
CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF DTC'S NOMINEE,
CEDE & CO., OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO
CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC). ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR
OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS
WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO.,
HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.


Section 3.10. Definitive Certificates.


If (a) DTC or the Depositor advises the Trustee that DTC is no
longer willing or able to continue as depositary, and the Depositor does not
appoint a qualified successor within 90 days; or (b) an Available Information
Event occurs, then, in any such case, the Trustee shall notify DTC of the
occurrence of any such event and of its intent to make definitive certificates
available, and shall request the surrender by DTC to the Trustee of the global
certificate or certificates evidencing the Certificates and shall notify all DTC
participants with interest in the Certificates of the availability of definitive
certificates through DTC. Upon such surrender, accompanied by registration
instructions from DTC, the Trustee shall execute and authenticate the definitive
certificates in accordance with the instructions of DTC. Neither the Certificate
Registrar nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and each may conclusively


27





rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the
issuance of definitive certificates, the Trustee shall recognize the registered

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN DUTIES



Section 6.1. Establishment of Collection Account and Securities
Account.


(a) The Trustee shall establish and maintain in the Trust's name
Eligible Trust Accounts known as the Collection Account and the Securities
Account, bearing an additional designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to
the obligations of the Trust, if any. The Trustee, directly or through its
agents, shall make reasonable efforts to collect all scheduled payments under
the Trust Assets and will follow, or cause to be followed, any collection
procedures that it would follow with respect to comparable financial assets that
it holds for its own account, provided that these procedures shall be consistent
with this Agreement and any related instrument governing the Underlying
Securities and any other Trust Asset.


(b) The Trustee shall possess all right, title and interest in and
to all funds on deposit from time to time in the Collection Account and the
Securities Account and in all proceeds thereof. The Collection Account and the
Securities Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to the obligations of the
Trust, if any. If at any time the Collection Account or the Securities Account
ceases to be an Eligible Trust Account, the Trustee shall within 5 Business Days
(or such longer period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, to which each Rating
Agency may consent) establish a new Collection Account or Securities Account, as
applicable, as an Eligible Trust Account and shall transfer any funds in the
existing Collection Account or Securities Account, as applicable, to such new
Collection Account or new Securities Account, as applicable.


(c) The Collection Account shall be a non-interest bearing account.
Pending application pursuant to Sections 6.2 hereof, moneys held in the
Collection Account shall be held uninvested.


(d) The Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that any Trust Asset
credited to the Securities Account shall be treated as a "financial asset"
within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.


(e) If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall receive any
order from the Trustee directing the transfer or redemption of any Trust Asset
on deposit in the Securities Account, the Securities Intermediary shall comply
with such entitlement order without further consent by the Depositor or any
other Person. The Securities Intermediary shall take all


32





instructions (including without limitation all notifications and entitlement
orders) with respect to the Securities Account solely from the Trustee.


(f) The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that:


(i) There are no other agreements entered into between the
Securities Intermediary and the Depositor with respect to the Securities
Account;


(ii) It has not entered into, and until the termination of
this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any other Person
relating to the Securities Account and/or any financial assets credited
thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with entitlement orders
(as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) of such other Person; and


(iii) It has not entered into, and until the termination of
the Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with the Depositor or the
Trustee purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the Securities
Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set forth in this

Section 6.1.


Section 6.2. Application of Trust Funds.


(a) The Trustee shall credit to the Collection Account all moneys or
property received by the Trust that constitute payments on, or proceeds from
redemption or sale (including issuer and third party tender offers and other
repurchases) of, the Underlying Securities. Any non-cash property received will
be liquidated by the Trustee in the manner determined by the Trustee and using
commercially reasonable efforts only to the extent necessary to avoid
distribution of fractional securities or other fractional property to
Certificateholders, and the proceeds thereof will be credited to the Collection
Account.


(b) Except as otherwise specified in subsections (c) and (d) below,
the Trustee shall, subject to its right pursuant to Sections 7.16(a) and (b) to
payment of its reasonable expenses related to any proceeding in respect of a
failure by the Underlying Securities Issuer to pay the Whole Amount Due,
distribute the Available Funds as follows:


(i) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee will pay from
Available Interest Funds to the Certificateholders, interest accrued and
unpaid, pro rata in proportion to their entitlements thereto; provided,
however, that if the Trustee has not received any amounts of Available
Interest Funds on or prior to the related Distribution Date, such amounts
shall be applied in accordance with this Section 6.2(b) promptly upon
receipt of such amounts.


(ii) The Trustee will pay Available Principal Funds to the
Certificateholders, pro rata by Certificate Principal Balance, from
Available Principal Funds, an amount not to exceed the then outstanding
Certificate Principal Balance.


(iii) Any Available Funds remaining in the Collection Account
after the payments set forth in clauses 6.2(b)(i) and 6.2(b)(ii) above
shall be paid to the Certificateholders, pro rata by Certificate Principal
Balance.


33





Any portion of the Available Funds (i) that does not constitute principal of, or
interest on, the Underlying Securities, (ii) that is not received in connection
with a redemption, repurchase or liquidation of or an unscheduled payment on the
Underlying Securities and (iii) for which allocation by the Trustee is not
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, shall be remitted by the Trustee to
the Certificateholders.


(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Underlying Securities are
redeemed, repurchased, repaid or liquidated prior to the Final Distribution Date
as a result of an Underlying Securities Payment Default, an Underlying
Securities Bankruptcy Default, a SEC Reporting Failure, a Trust Swap Payment
Default, a Trust Regulatory Event or the termination of SEC reporting by the
Swap Counterparty and its failure to find a replacement counterparty pursuant to
the Swap Agreement, then a corresponding portion of the Certificates will be
redeemed. On the third Business Day after the Trustee receives the proceeds of
any such redemption, repurchase, repayment or liquidations, the Trustee shall,
subject to its right pursuant to Sections 7.16(a) and (b) to payment of its
reasonable expenses related to any proceeding in respect of a failure by the
Underlying Securities Issuer to pay the Whole Amount Due, make distributions to
the Certificateholders, pro rata by Certificate Principal Balance.


(d) If the Underlying Securities Issuer (or any third party tender
offeror) redeems, tenders for or makes other repurchases of some or all of the
Underlying Securities, and the Option Holder does not elect to exercise its Call
Options, then a corresponding portion of the Certificates will be redeemed, as
set forth below. On the third Business Day after the Trustee receives the
proceeds of any full or partial redemption, tender for or repurchase of the
Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall, subject to its right pursuant to
Sections 7.16(a) and (b) to payment of its reasonable expenses related to any
proceeding in respect of a failure by the Underlying Securities Issuer to pay
the Whole Amount Due, make distributions to the Certificateholders, pro rata by
Certificate Principal Balance.


(e) It is understood that payments in the nature of unscheduled
payment or redemption penalties, late payment charges, default interest or
reinvestment income which may be received by the Trustee shall be deposited by
the Trustee in the Collection Account for distribution to the Certificateholders
as additional interest, and shall not be retained by the Trustee for its own
account.


Section 6.3. Certain Provisions Applicable to all Distributions to
Certificateholders.


(a) If any withholding tax is imposed on any distribution (or
allocations of income) by the Trust to a Certificateholder, such tax shall
reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder. The Trustee
is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable
to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is
legally required to be withheld by the Trust (but such authorization shall not
prevent the Trustee if indemnified to its satisfaction, from contesting any such
tax in appropriate proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted
by law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding
tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash
distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Trust
and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If the Trustee determines that
withholding tax is


34





payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a
Certificateholder that is a non-U.S. Person), the Trustee may in its sole
discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this Section 6.3(a). If a
Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the
Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with such Certificateholder in making such
claim so long as such Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Trustee for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred. The Trustee shall not be liable to any Person
for withholding or failing to withhold any such withholding tax. In the event
that withholding taxes should have been imposed on any distribution by the Trust
to a Certificateholder but was not so withheld at the time of the payment, the
Trustee is hereby also authorized and directed to obtain from amounts otherwise
distributable currently and in the future to the respective Certificateholder to
pay amounts that should have been withheld by the Trust and any penalties and
interest due.


(b) [Reserved].


(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, the
right of any Certificateholder to receive a distribution of principal, interest,
and premium, if any, allocable to a Certificate and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such distribution shall not be impaired without the consent
of such Certificateholder.


Section 6.4. Appointment of Paying Agent.


The Trustee may appoint one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying
Agent") with respect to the Certificates. Any such Paying Agent shall be
authorized to make distributions to Certificateholders from the Collection
Account pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and shall report the
amounts of such distributions to the Trustee. Any Paying Agent shall have the
revocable power to withdraw funds from such Collection Account for the purpose
of making such distributions. The Trustee in its sole discretion may revoke such
power and remove the Paying Agent. The initial Paying Agent(s) shall be the
Trustee and any co-paying agent chosen by the Depositor and reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee, including, if and so long as the Certificates are
listed on any securities exchange and such exchange so requires, a co-paying
agent in any city required by the rules of such exchange. Any Paying Agent shall
be permitted to resign as a Paying Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Trustee. If
the Trustee shall resign as a Paying Agent, the Trustee shall appoint a
successor or additional Paying Agent. The Trustee shall cause each Paying Agent
and each successor or additional Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent or successor or additional
Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee that (a) it will hold all sums, if
any, held by it for distribution to the Certificateholders in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be
distributed to such Certificateholders or returned to the Trustee, and (b) it
will give the Trustee notice of any default by the Underlying Securities Issuer
(if such default is known to such Paying Agent). The Paying Agent shall return
all unclaimed funds to the Trustee and upon removal shall also return all funds
in its possession to the Trustee. The provisions of Sections 7.1, 7.3, 7.8 and
7.10 shall apply to the Trustee also in its roles as Paying Agent, for so long
as the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
appointment of a Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not release the
Trustee from the duties, obligations, responsibilities or liabilities arising
under this Agreement other than with respect to funds paid to such Paying Agent.


35





Section 6.5. Method of Payment.


Distributions required to be made to Certificateholders on any
Distribution Date shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the
immediately preceding Record Date either by wire transfer, in immediately
available funds, to the account of such Certificateholder at a bank or other
entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall
have provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written instructions at
least five Business Days prior to such Record Date, or, if not, by check mailed
to such Certificateholder at the address of such Certificateholder appearing in
the Certificate Register.


Section 6.6. Reports to Certificateholders.


On the Business Day next following each Distribution Date, the
Trustee shall forward or cause to be forwarded to the Depositor, the Swap
Counterparty, each Certificateholder, the Option Agent and the New York Stock
Exchange (or, if the Certificates are no longer listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, to any exchange or securities trading system on which the Certificates
are then listed or quoted), a statement setting forth:


(a) the amount of the distribution on such Distribution Date to the
Certificateholders allocable to principal of and premium, if any, and interest
on the Certificates, and the amount of aggregate unpaid interest accrued as of
such Distribution Date;


(b) the aggregate stated principal amount of the Underlying
Securities, the current rating assigned by each Rating Agency thereto and the
current interest rate thereon at the close of business on such Distribution
Date; and


(c) the aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of the Certificates
at the close of business on such Distribution Date.


In the case of information furnished pursuant to subclause (a)
above, the amounts shall be expressed as an aggregate dollar amount for all the
Certificates or as a dollar amount per minimum authorized denomination of the
Certificates. Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar
year, the Trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during such
calendar year was a Certificateholder a statement containing the information set
forth in subclauses (a) and (b) above, aggregated for such calendar year or the
applicable portion thereof during which such person was a Certificateholder.
Such obligation of the Trustee shall be deemed to have been satisfied to the
extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the
Trustee pursuant to any requirements of the Code as are from time to time in
effect. In the case of the rating furnished pursuant to subclause (b) above, the
Trustee may rely on an information agent such as Bloomberg L.P.


Section 6.7. Accounting and Information to Certificateholders,
Internal Revenue Service and Others.


(a) The Trustee shall (i) maintain (or cause to be maintained) the
books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the accrual method of accounting,

(ii) deliver to each Certificateholder, as may be required by the Code and
applicable Treasury Regulations or otherwise, such information reasonably
available to the Trustee as may be required to enable each


36





Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax returns, (iii) file such tax
returns relating to the Trust and make such elections as may from time to time
be required or appropriate under any applicable state or federal statute or rule
or regulation thereunder, (iv) cause such tax returns to be signed in the manner
required by law and (v) collect or cause to be collected any withholding tax as
described in and in accordance with subsection 6.3(a) with respect to income or
distributions to Certificateholders. The Trustee shall be authorized to retain
an agent for the purpose of performing its obligations under the preceding
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), but no expense of any such agent shall be an
expense of the Trust, notwithstanding that such expenses shall not have been
paid by the Depositor pursuant to its separate fee agreement with the Trustee.


(b) The Depositor shall appoint a firm of independent certified
public accountants to determine that the Trust Assets exist at the balance sheet
date and that such Trust Assets reflects the correct value on that date and to
review each of the distribution reports prepared by the Trustee pursuant to

Section 6.6 of this Agreement and to verify (i) that such reports and the
calculations made therein were made accurately and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and (ii) that the Depositor and the Trustee have each
fulfilled their obligations under this Agreement. The Depositor shall instruct
the accountants (i) to promptly report to the Depositor any errors in such
distribution reports discovered in verifying such calculations and (ii) to
render to the Depositor an annual examination report, prepared in compliance
with procedures to be agreed upon between the Depositor and such independent
certified public accountants based on established or stated criteria as set
forth in the professional standards of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, within 45 days (or such longer period as may be acceptable
to the Depositor) following the end of each calendar year that specifies the
calculations made in reviewing the distribution reports prepared by the
Depositor for the previous calendar year and such accountants' associated
findings.


Section 6.8. Signature on Returns.


Subject to applicable law, the Trustee shall sign on behalf of the
Trust any and all tax returns of the Trust.


Section 6.9. No Implied Duties of the Depositor.


No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement against the Depositor. The Depositor shall not be under any obligation
whatsoever to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other
proceeding in respect of the Underlying Securities or other Trust Assets or the
Certificates that is not incidental to its responsibilities under this Agreement
or that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability unless
indemnification satisfactory to it is provided.

the Certificateholders, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement
against the Trustee.


(b) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
conclusively rely upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and
conforming to the requirements of this Agreement in determining the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions contained therein; provided,
however, that the Trustee shall have examined such certificates or opinions so
as to determine compliance of the same with the requirements of this Agreement.


(c) The Trustee shall not be relieved from liability for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct
or bad faith, except that:


(i) this Section 7.1(c) shall not limit the effect of Section
7.1(a) or (b);

made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee,

action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a
direction received by it pursuant to Section 5.1, 5.3 or 7.5; and

diminution in value of Underlying Securities sold by it under this
Agreement in good faith in accordance with its terms.

the Collection Account, and the Trustee shall not be liable to pay any interest
thereon.


(e) The Trustee shall not take any action that (i) is inconsistent
with the purposes of the Trust set forth in Section 2.3, (ii) would, to the
actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, result in the Trust's
being characterized as other than a grantor trust for federal income tax
purposes, or (iii) the Trustee should reasonably be expected to know would
adversely affect the intended classification of the Trust as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes (in this connection, the Trustee shall be protected
in assuming that the performance of its express duties hereunder, including any
actions taken at the direction of the Depositor, is in accordance with this
Agreement). The Depositor shall not direct the Trustee to take any action that
would violate the provisions of this Section 7.1(e).


38

satisfactory to it is provided.

the Certificateholders.


(i) The Trustee shall perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or
cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further

the terms and conditions of any Underlying Securities or other Trust Assets; the
validity of the assignment of any Underlying Securities or other Trust Assets to
the Trust or of any intervening assignment; the completeness of any Underlying
Securities or other Trust Assets; the performance or enforcement of any

character, genuineness, sufficiency, value or validity of any of the Underlying
Securities, the Certificates (other than the certificate of authentication on
the Certificates), the Call Options or any related documents, and the Trustee
shall in no event assume or incur any liability, duty or obligation to any
Certificateholder, other than as expressly provided for in this Agreement;


(d) the Trustee shall not be liable for the default or misconduct of
the Depositor or any other party (other than itself, as provided in this
Agreement) under this Agreement or otherwise;


(e) except as described in Section 7.16 in connection with an
Underlying Securities Event of Default, the Trustee shall be under no obligation
to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Agreement or to
make any investigation of related matters or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation under or in relation to this Agreement at the request, order or
direction of any of the Certificateholders, unless the Certificateholders have
offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses
and liabilities which may be incurred by the Trustee. The right of the Trustee
to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this Agreement shall not be
construed as a duty, and the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its
misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any such act;


(f) the Trustee shall not incur any liability to any
Certificateholder if, by reason of any provision of any present or future law,
or regulation thereunder, or any governmental authority, or by reason of any act
of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party,
the Trustee shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or
thing that the terms of this Agreement provide shall be done or performed; and
the Trustee shall not incur any liability to any Certificateholder by reason of
any non-performance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act
or thing which the terms of this Agreement provide shall or may be done or
performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any
discretion provided for in this Agreement; and


40





(g) the rights, protections, immunities and benefits given to the
Trustee hereunder are extended to, and enforceable by, the Trustee in each of
its capacities hereunder.


Section 7.4. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Trustee.


The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the TIA, excluding
any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the TIA. A Trustee who has
resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the TIA to the
extent required by that Section.


Section 7.5. Action Upon Instruction by Certificateholders.


(a) Subject to Sections 5.3 and 9.3 and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the Certificateholders may by written instruction direct the
Trustee in the management of the Trust. Subject to Sections 7.3(e), 7.5(c) and
7.15, such direction may be exercised at any time by written instruction of the
Certificateholders pursuant to Section 5.3.


(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not be required
to take any action under this Agreement if the Trustee shall have reasonably
determined, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to
result in liability on the part of the Trustee or is contrary to the terms of
this Agreement or is otherwise contrary to law, or if the Trustee shall not have
received indemnity satisfactory to it as provided in Section 7.3(e). No
provision of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to expend or risk funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its rights
or powers under this Agreement, if the Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk
or liability is not reasonably assured or provided to it.


(c) Whenever the Trustee is unable to decide between alternative
courses of action permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement, or is
unsure as to the application, intent, interpretation or meaning of any provision
of this Agreement, the Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form as shall
be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Certificateholders (with a copy
to the Option Agent) requesting instruction as to the course of action to be
adopted, and, to the extent the Trustee acts in good faith in accordance with
any instruction received in accordance with Section 5.3, or otherwise in
accordance with the instructions of the Depositor or the Certificateholders in
accordance with this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable on account of
such action to any Person. If the Trustee shall not have received appropriate
instructions within ten days of such notice (or within such shorter period of
time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary under the
circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from
taking such action which is consistent, in its view, with this Agreement, and as
it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, and the
Trustee shall have no liability to any Person for any such action or inaction.


Section 7.6. Furnishing of Documents; Reports to Certificateholders
and DTC.


(a) The Trustee shall furnish to the Certificateholders and the Swap
Counterparty, with a copy to the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the
Certificates are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, to any
exchange or securities trading system on which the Certificates are then listed
or quoted), promptly upon receipt of a written request therefor, duplicates or
copies of all reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates, financial
statements and


41





any other instruments furnished to the Trustee under this Agreement. In
addition, if required by Section 313(a) of the TIA, within 60 days after
December 31 of each year, the Trustee shall mail to (i) each Certificateholder
as required by Section 313(c) of the TIA and (ii) the Depositor, a brief report
dated as of such date that complies with Section 313(a) of the TIA. A copy of
any report delivered pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) shall, at the time of its
mailing to Certificateholders and the Depositor, be filed by the Trustee with
the Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the Certificates are no
longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, to any exchange or securities
trading system on which the Certificates are then listed or quoted).


(b) The Trustee shall within 90 days of an event described in

Section 313(b) of the TIA mail to (i) each Certificateholder as required by

Section 313(c) of the TIA and (ii) the Depositor, a brief report dated as of
such date that complies with Section 313(b) of the TIA. A copy of any report
delivered pursuant to this Section 7.6(b) shall, at the time of its mailing to
Certificateholders and the Depositor, be filed by the Trustee with the
Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the Certificates are no
longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, to any exchange or securities
trading system on which the Certificates are then listed or quoted).


(c) Annual unaudited reports setting forth the amounts of payments
on the Certificates, and whether such amounts are principal, premium or interest
shall be prepared by the Trustee and sent to the Certificateholders.


Section 7.7. Representations and Warranties of Trustee.

Certificateholders, that:


(a) it is a banking association duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America;

(d) the Trustee has not granted any lien on the Trust Assets nor are
the Trust Assets subject to any lien on properties of the Trustee in its
individual capacity; the Trustee has no actual knowledge and has not received
actual notice of any lien on the Trust Assets (other than any liens of the
Trustee in favor of the beneficiaries of the Trust Agreement); other than the
interests of the Certificateholders, the books and records of the Trustee do not
identify any Person as having an interest in the Trust Assets;


(e) the Trustee makes no representation as to (i) the validity,
legality, sufficiency or enforceability of any of the Trust Assets or (ii) the
collectability, insurability, effectiveness or suitability of any of the Trust
Assets;


42





(f) the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement

(i) will not violate any provision of any law or regulation governing the powers
of the Trustee or any order, writ, judgment or decree of any court, arbitrator
or governmental authority applicable to the Trustee or any of its assets and

(ii) will not violate any provision of the corporate charter or by-laws of the
Trustee;


(g) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Trustee and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Trustee,
enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and
by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and


(h) the execution, delivery and performance by the Trustee of this
Agreement will not require the authorization, consent or approval of, the giving
of notice to, the filing or registration with, or the taking of any other action
in respect of, any governmental authority or agency regulating the banking and
corporate trust activities of banks or trust companies in the jurisdiction in
which the Trust was formed.


The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary hereby represent and
warrant that:


(a) The Securities Account is a "securities account" within the
meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC and contains only property held by the
Securities Intermediary as fiduciary. The Securities Intermediary is acting in
the capacity of a "securities intermediary" within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(14) of the UCC;


(b) The Granted Underlying Securities have been (i) delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to the Agreement; (ii) credited to the
Securities Account; and (iii) registered in the name of the Securities
Intermediary or its nominee, indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank
or credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the
Securities Intermediary. In no case will any Underlying Securities or other
financial assets credited to the Securities Account be registered in the name of
the Depositor, payable to the order of the Depositor or specially indorsed to
the Depositor except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to
the Securities Intermediary or in blank; and


(c) The Securities Account is an account to which financial assets
are or may be credited, and the Securities Intermediary shall treat the Trustee
as entitled to exercise the rights that comprise any financial asset credited to
the account.


Section 7.8. Reliance; Advice of Counsel.


(a) The Trustee shall incur no liability to anyone in acting upon
any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent, order,
certificate, report, opinion, bond, facsimile transmission or other document or
paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to
be signed by the proper party or parties and need not investigate any fact or
matter in any such document. The Trustee may accept a certified copy of a
resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of any corporate
party as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by such
body and that the same is in full force and effect. As to


43





any fact or matter the method of the determination of which is not specifically
prescribed herein, the Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a
certificate, signed by the president or any vice president or by the treasurer
or other authorized officers of the relevant party, as to such fact or matter,
and such certificate shall constitute full protection to the Trustee for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.


(b) In the exercise or administration of the trusts hereby created
and in the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement, the
Trustee: (i) may act directly or through its agents, attorneys, custodians or
nominees (including the granting of a power of attorney to Responsible Officers
of the Trustee to execute and deliver this Agreement, any Certificate or other
documents related thereto on behalf of the Trustee) pursuant to agreements
entered into with any of them, and the Trustee shall not be liable for the
conduct or misconduct of such agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees if such
agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees shall have been selected by the
Trustee in good faith and with reasonable care and (ii) may consult with
counsel, accountants and other skilled professionals to be selected in good
faith and with reasonable care and employed by it. The Trustee shall not be
liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance
with the opinion or advice of any such accountants or other such persons and not
contrary to this Agreement.


Section 7.9. Trustee May Own Certificates.


The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be
permitted to become the owner or pledgee of Certificates and may deal with the
Depositor in the same manner as it would have if it were not the Trustee,
subject to the limitations on the rights of the Trustee, if it is holding the
Certificates in its individual capacity, in voting on any demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, set forth in the definition of
"Outstanding" in Section 1.1.


Section 7.10. Compensation and Indemnity.


U.S. Bank Trust National Association shall be entitled to receive
from the Depositor, as compensation for acting as Trustee hereunder and acting
as Option Agent under the Call Option Agreement, fees pursuant to a separate
agreement between U.S. Bank Trust National Association and the Depositor, and
shall be reimbursed by the Depositor for all reasonable expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made as Trustee (including the reasonable compensation,
disbursements and expenses of its counsel and other persons not regularly in its
employ). The Depositor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and its
successors, assigns, agents, directors, officers and employees against any and
all loss, liability or reasonable expense (including attorney's fees) incurred
by it in connection with any legal action relating to the administration of this
Trust and the performance of its duties thereunder. The Trustee shall notify the
Depositor promptly of any claim for which it or any such Person may seek
indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Depositor shall not relieve
the Depositor of its obligations hereunder. The Depositor need not reimburse any
expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense that is incurred by
the Trustee through the Trustee's own misconduct, negligence or bad faith in the
performance of the Trustee's duties under this Agreement. The Depositor agrees
that the provisions of this Section 7.10 shall apply to U.S. Bank Trust National
Association acting in its individual capacity hereunder in the same manner as
they apply to the Trustee. The


44





indemnities contained in this Section 7.10 shall survive the resignation or
termination of the Trustee or the termination of this Agreement.


Failure by the Depositor to pay, reimburse or indemnify the Trustee
shall not entitle the Trustee to any payment, reimbursement or indemnification
from the Trust, nor shall such failure release the Trustee from the duties it is
required to perform under this Agreement. Any unpaid, unreimbursed or
unindemnified amounts shall not be borne by the Trust and shall not constitute a
claim against the Trust (except to the extent that the Trustee is entitled to
recover such amount pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.16(a)).


Section 7.11. Replacement of Trustee.


(a) The Trustee may resign at any time and be discharged from the
trusts hereby created by giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the
Depositor. The Depositor shall appoint a successor Trustee by delivering a
written instrument, in duplicate, to the resigning Trustee and the successor
Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been appointed and have accepted
appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee. The Depositor shall remove the Trustee if:


(i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of Section 7.14 and shall fail to resign after written
request therefor by the Depositor;


(ii) the Trustee shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;


(iii) a receiver or other public officer shall be appointed or
take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for
the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;


(iv) the Trustee shall fail to carry out its duties hereunder;
or


(v) the Trustee shall otherwise be incapable of acting.


(b) If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in
the office of Trustee for any reason, the Depositor shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate (one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the outgoing Trustee so removed and one copy to
the successor Trustee) and shall pay all fees and expenses owed to the outgoing
Trustee.


(c) Unless the Trust has been completely liquidated and the proceeds
of the liquidation distributed to Certificateholders, any resignation or removal
of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to any of the
provisions of this Section 7.11 shall not become effective until a written
acceptance of appointment is delivered by the successor Trustee to the outgoing
Trustee and the Depositor and all fees and expenses due to the outgoing Trustee
are paid; provided that with respect to any of the events specified in Section
7.11(a), the payment of the fees and expenses due to the outgoing Trustee shall
not be a condition for the removal of such Trustee and the appointment of a
successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee appointed pursuant to


45





this Section 7.11 must be eligible to act in such capacity in accordance with

Section 7.14 and, following compliance with the preceding sentence, shall become
fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor under this Agreement, with like effect as if originally named as
Trustee. The Depositor shall provide notice within five (5) Business Days of the
resignation or removal of the Trustee to the Swap Counterparty, each Rating
Agency and each Certificateholder.


(d) The predecessor Trustee shall upon payment of its fees and
expenses deliver to the successor Trustee all documents and statements and
moneys held by it under this Agreement. The Depositor and the predecessor
Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as
may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the
successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.


(e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee pursuant
to this Section 7.11, the Depositor shall mail notice of the successor of such
Trustee to the Swap Counterparty, all Certificateholders and each Rating Agency.


Section 7.12. Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.


Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that
such corporation is eligible pursuant to Section 7.14, and without the execution
or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto; provided, however, that the Trustee shall mail notice of such merger or
consolidation to the Depositor, the Swap Counterparty, and each Rating Agency.


Section 7.13. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.


(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any
time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in
which any part of the Trust Assets may at the time be located, the Depositor and
the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver
all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Trustee and the
Depositor to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Trustee, or as separate trustee
or trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Assets, and to vest in such Person
in such capacity such title to the Trust Assets, or any part thereof, and,
subject to the other provisions of this Section 7.13, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Depositor and the Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. If the Depositor shall not have joined in such
appointment within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by it of a request to do
so, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No
co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet
the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 7.14 and no
notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be
required pursuant to Section 7.11.


(b) Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and
conditions:


46





(i) all rights, power, duties and obligations conferred or
imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised or
performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly
(it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not
authorized to act separately without the Trustee joining in such act),
except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any
particular act or acts are to be performed, the Trustee shall be
incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event
such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of
title to the Trust Assets or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction)
shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or
co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Trustee;


(ii) no separate trustee or co-trustee under this Agreement
shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other
trustee under this Agreement; and


(iii) the Depositor and the Trustee acting jointly may at any
time accept the resignation of, or may remove, any separate trustee or
co-trustee.


(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall
be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and
the conditions of this Article VII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions
of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement
relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection
to, the Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and a copy
thereof given to the Depositor.


(d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the
Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor trustee.


Section 7.14. Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.


(a) The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of

Section 310(a) of the TIA. The Trustee shall at all times be a bank that is not
an Affiliate of the Depositor (but may have normal banking relationships with
the Depositor or the Underlying Securities Issuer and its respective
Affiliates), which (i) is organized and doing business under the laws of any
State or the United States; (ii) is authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers; (iii) has a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000; (iv) is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authority; and (v) has (or has a parent which has) a long-term unsecured debt
rating of at least BBB- by Standard & Poor's and at least Baa3 by Moody's. If
such corporation shall publish reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of the


47





aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this

Section 7.14, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.14, the Trustee
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section
7.11.


(b) The Trustee shall comply with Section 310(b) of the TIA;
provided that if the exclusion requirements set forth in Section 310(b)(1) of
the TIA are met, any other trust agreement under which other securities are
outstanding that evidence beneficial ownership interests in obligations of any
Underlying Securities Issuer shall be excluded from the operation of Section
310(b)(1) of the TIA.


Section 7.15. Voting of the Underlying Securities Other than in the
Case of an Underlying Securities Event of Default; Modification of the Swap
Agreement.


The Trustee shall not consent to any amendment, modification or
supplement to the Underlying Securities except as permitted by this Agreement.


(a) The Trustee shall exercise any voting or consent rights with
respect to the Underlying Securities as set forth in Sections 7.15(b), (c) or

(d) below. The Trustee shall not, however, exercise such rights if the exercise
thereof (or the action with respect to which such rights are so elicited) would
adversely affect the intended classification of the Trust as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes.


(b) The Trustee may, subject to the provisions of Section 7.15(c)
and, in the case of an Underlying Securities Event of Default, Section 7.16,
vote and give consents and waivers in respect of the Underlying Securities as
permitted by DTC. In the event that the Trustee receives a request from DTC or
the Underlying Securities Trustee or the Underlying Securities Issuer for its
consent to any amendment, modification or waiver of the Underlying Securities,
the Underlying Securities Trust Agreement or any other documents relating to the
Underlying Securities, or receives any other solicitation for any action with
respect to the Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall mail a notice of such
proposed amendment, modification, waiver or solicitation to each Option Holder,
the Swap Counterparty and each Certificateholder of record as of such date. The
Trustee shall request instructions from the Certificateholders as to whether or
not to consent to or vote to accept such amendment, modification, waiver or
solicitation, and, subject to Section 7.15(c), the Trustee will vote a principal
amount of the Underlying Securities equal to the Certificate Principal Balance
of the Outstanding Certificates whose holders have given the Trustee
instructions to vote.


(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Trustee
shall at no time vote or consent to any matter:


(i) unless such vote or consent (or the action with respect to
which such vote or consent is solicited) would not, based on an Opinion of
Counsel, adversely affect the intended classification of the Trust as a
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes; or


(ii) that would amend the Underlying Securities Trust
Agreement or Underlying Securities to alter the timing or amount of any
payment on the Underlying


48





Securities, except at the direction of the holders of all the Outstanding
Certificates and the Option Holder; or


(iii) that would result in the exchange or substitution of any of
the outstanding Underlying Securities pursuant to a plan for the refunding or
refinancing of such Underlying Securities, except at the direction of the
holders of all the Outstanding Certificates and the Option Holder.


The Trustee shall have no liability for any failure to act resulting
from any Certificateholder's or Option Holder's late return of, or failure to
return, directions requested by the Trustee from the Certificateholders or
Option Holder with respect to the Certificates.


(d) If an offer is made by the Underlying Securities Issuer to issue
new obligations in exchange and substitution for any of the Underlying
Securities, pursuant to a plan for the refunding or refinancing of the
Underlying Securities, or any other offer is made for the Underlying Securities,
the Trustee shall mail a notice of such offer to each Option Holder and to each
Certificateholder of record as of such date and must reject any such offer
unless directed to accept it by holders of 100% of the Outstanding Certificates
and the Option Holder, in which case the Trustee will accept the offer, provided
that the Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that any such
exchange will not adversely affect the intended classification of the Trust as a
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes and will not result in a deemed
exchange of the Underlying Securities or the Certificates for federal income tax
purposes. However, if the Option Holder has given notice of its exercise of the
Call Options on the Certificates and has paid the Call Price within such ten

(10) Business Day period, the Trustee shall, with respect to such offer, accept
the offer for a principal amount of the Underlying Securities equal to the
Certificate Principal Balance of the Outstanding Certificates subject to such
Call Options as directed by the Option Holder.


(e) The Trustee shall not consent to any amendment to the Swap
Agreement unless (i) it shall have received the prior consent to such amendment
of Certificateholders representing 66 2/3% of the Voting Rights and (ii) each
Rating Agency shall have confirmed in writing that such amendment will not
result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the
Certificates; provided, however, the Trustee may consent to any amendment to the
Swap Agreement without the consent of the Certificateholders to cure any
ambiguity in, or to correct or supplement any provision of the Swap Agreement
which may be inconsistent with any other provision thereof, or to otherwise cure
any defect therein, provided that any such amendment does not materially
adversely affect the interest of the Certificateholders and that each Rating
Agency shall have given its prior written confirmation that such amendment will
not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the
Certificates; provided further, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Trustee shall not consent to any amendment to the Swap Agreement
that alters the timing or amount of any payment on the Swap Agreement unless (i)
it shall have received the prior consent to such amendment of Certificateholders
representing 100% of the Voting Rights and (ii) each Rating Agency has been
given prior written notice of any such amendment (and no rating confirmation
shall be required).

Section 7.16. Trustee's Liquidation, Enforcement and Voting of
Underlying Securities Upon an Underlying Securities Event of Default.


(a) If an Underlying Securities Payment Default or an Underlying
Securities Bankruptcy Default occurs and continues unremedied for the period
specified in the Underlying Securities Trust Agreement (or, if no such period is
specified, upon such Underlying Securities Payment Default or an Underlying
Securities Bankruptcy Default), and the Underlying Securities Issuer shall, upon
demand of the Trustee, fail to pay forthwith to the Trustee, for the benefit of
the Certificateholders, the whole amount then due and payable on the Underlying
Securities for principal or premium (if any) and interest, with interest upon
the overdue principal, premium and interest at the rate borne by the Underlying
Securities as provided for in the Underlying Securities Trust Agreement, and in
addition thereto such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs
and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel, to the
extent permitted by law and the terms of the Underlying Securities (such amount,
the "Whole Amount Due"), the Trustee shall promptly thereafter proceed against
the Underlying Securities Issuer on behalf of the Certificateholders to enforce
the Underlying Securities or otherwise protect the interests of the
Certificateholders (including, in the Trustee's discretion, voting to accelerate
the Underlying Securities). The Trustee shall be entitled to recover its
reasonable expenses of any such proceeding in respect of a failure by the
Underlying Securities Issuer to pay the Whole Amount Due from the proceeds of
the Trust Assets, and to secure such obligation to pay such expenses, the
Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Certificates on all Trust Assets for the
amount of such expenses.


(b) If any Underlying Securities Event of Default (other than an
Underlying Securities Payment Default or an Underlying Securities Bankruptcy
Default) occurs and is continuing, then, subject to Section 7.1(f), the Trustee
may proceed against the Underlying Securities Issuer on behalf of the
Certificateholders; provided, however, that only with the approval of the
holders of Outstanding Certificates representing 66-2/3% of the Voting Rights
will (i) the Trustee be entitled to any reimbursement out of the Trust Assets,

(ii) the Trustee vote the Underlying Securities in favor of directing, or take
other action as may be appropriate to direct, the Underlying Securities Trustee
to accelerate the Underlying Securities by declaring the unpaid principal amount
of the Underlying Securities and any accrued and unpaid interest on the
Underlying Securities to be due and payable, or (iii) the holders of the
Certificates be entitled to direct the Trustee in any such proceeding, subject
to the receipt by the Trustee of indemnity satisfactory to it, and may instruct
the Trustee to stop the proceeding against the Underlying Securities Issuer and,
using commercially reasonable efforts, sell the Underlying Securities instead,
in a manner determined by the Trustee.


(c) If there is an Underlying Securities Payment Default, an
Underlying Securities Bankruptcy Default, a SEC Reporting Failure, a Trust Swap
Payment Default, a Trust Regulatory Event or any other Underlying Securities
Event of Default and such Underlying Securities Event of Default is known to the
Trustee, the Trustee shall give notice to the Certificateholders, the Option
Agent and the Swap Counterparty in the manner and to the extent provided in

Section 313(c) of the TIA within five (5) Business Days after the Trustee has
actual knowledge of the occurrence of such Underlying Securities Event of
Default. Such notice shall identify the Underlying Securities and set forth (i)
the date and nature of such event of default, (ii)


50





if applicable, the amount of interest, principal or premium in default, and

(iii) any other information that the Trustee may deem appropriate.


(d) Upon the occurrence of an Underlying Securities Payment Default,
an Underlying Securities Bankruptcy Default, a SEC Reporting Failure, a Trust
Swap Payment Default, a Trust Regulatory Event or the termination of SEC
reporting by the Swap Counterparty and its failure to find a replacement
counterparty pursuant to the Swap Agreement, thirty (30) days after giving
notice to the Certificateholders, the Trustee, using commercially reasonable
efforts, shall sell the Underlying Securities in a manner determined by the
Trustee and deposit the liquidation proceeds, if any, into the Collection
Account for distribution not later than three (3) Business Days after the
receipt of such proceeds in accordance with Section 6.2(c) of this Agreement.


(e) If, following an Underlying Securities Event of Default
(excluding an Underlying Securities Payment Default and an Underlying Securities
Bankruptcy Default), the Trustee receives money or other property in respect of
the Underlying Securities (including from the sale thereof) or actual notice
that money or other property will be received, the Trustee will promptly give
notice to the registered holders of the Outstanding Certificates that remain
unpaid, and to the Option Agent and the Swap Counterparty. Such notice shall
state that the Trustee shall, not later than three (3) Business Days after the
receipt of such moneys or other property, allocate and distribute such moneys or
other property to the holders of the Certificates then Outstanding and unpaid
(after deducting the costs incurred in connection therewith) in accordance with

Section 6.2(b). Non-cash property shall be distributed in-kind except that, to
the extent necessary to avoid distribution of fractional securities or other
fractional property to the Certificateholders, non-cash property will be
liquidated by the Trustee, using commercially reasonable efforts, in the manner
determined by the Trustee, and the proceeds thereof distributed in cash.


(f) With the unanimous consent of all the Certificateholders, the
Trustee, using commercially reasonable efforts, shall sell the Underlying
Securities in a manner determined by the Trustee and deposit the proceeds into
the Collection Account for distribution not later than three (3) Business Days
after the receipt of such proceeds in accordance with Section 6.2(b) of this
Agreement.


Section 7.17. Swap Agreement Termination Events


(a) Until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge
of the occurrence of an event that would constitute a Swap Agreement Termination
Event, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume (and shall be fully protected,
indemnified and held harmless in doing so, in accordance with Section 7.10 of
this Agreement) that no Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred and may
accordingly seek instructions under this Section 7.17 exclusively from the Swap
Counterparty.


(b) As promptly as practicable after, and in any event within 30
days after, the occurrence of any Swap Agreement Termination Event actually
known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall give notice of such Swap Agreement
Termination Event to the Certificateholders.


51





Section 7.18. Annual Statement.


The Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor, on or before February 15th of
each year, an annual statement signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee to
the effect that the Trustee has fulfilled its obligations under this Trust
Agreement throughout the preceding year with respect to the Certificates. A copy
of such certificate may be obtained by any Certificateholder by a request in
writing to the Trustee addressed to the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.



ARTICLE VIII




TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT



Section 8.1. Termination of Agreement.


(a) This Agreement (other than Section 7.10) shall terminate and the
Trust shall dissolve, wind-up and terminate and be of no further force or effect
upon 30 days after the final distribution by the Trustee of all moneys or other
property or proceeds of the Trust Assets in accordance with the terms of Article
VI of this Agreement (the date of such termination, the "Termination Date"). The
bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, death or incapacity of any
Certificateholder shall not (i) operate to terminate this Agreement or the
Trust, (ii) entitle such Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to
claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court for a
partition or winding up of all or any part of the Trust or the Trust Assets or

(iii) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties
hereto.


(b) Neither the Depositor nor any Certificateholder in its capacity
as such shall be entitled to revoke or terminate the Trust. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, a Certificateholder that is also an Option Holder may
exercise the Call Options in accordance with its terms and have the Certificates
acquired pursuant to such exercise cancelled pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof
whether or not such exercise would result in the early termination of the Trust
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.


(c) Notice of termination of the Trust, specifying the date upon
which the Certificateholders shall surrender their Certificates to the Trustee
for payment of the final distribution and cancellation, shall be given by the
Trustee by letter to the Certificateholders mailed in accordance with Section
10.3 below stating: (i) the date upon or with respect to which final
distributions on the Certificates shall be made upon presentation and surrender
of the Certificates at the office of the Trustee therein designated; (ii) the
amount of any such final distributions; (iii) that the Record Date, if any,
otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable, distributions
being made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the
office of the Trustee therein specified; (iv) the office where definitive
certificates should be surrendered to the Trustee; and (v) that after such date,
no further periodic distributions shall accrue on the Certificates. The Trustee
shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar (if other than the Trustee)
and the Depositor at the time such notice is given to Certificateholders. Upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall cause to be
distributed to Certificateholders amounts distributable on such Distribution
Date pursuant to Section 6.2.


52





(d) If any Certificateholder shall not surrender its Certificates
for cancellation within six months after the date specified in the written
notice described in Section 8.1(c) above, the Trustee shall give a second
written notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect
thereto. If within one year after the second notice any of the Certificates
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee may take
appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact
the remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates, and
the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other assets that shall
remain subject to this Agreement.



ARTICLE IX

Option Holder.

of this Agreement that would affect the method, amount or timing of payment due
to the Swap Counterparty or the consent rights of the Swap Counterparty
hereunder without satisfying the consent requirements set forth in the Swap
Agreement.


Section 9.4. Form of Amendments.


(a) Promptly after the execution of any amendment, supplement or
consent pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3(a), the Trustee shall furnish a copy of
such amendment, supplement or consent to each Certificateholder, the Swap
Counterparty and to each Rating Agency.


(b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders
pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other
consents of Certificateholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing
the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be
subject to such reasonable requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.


(c) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the
Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating
that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this
Agreement and all conditions provided for in this Trust Agreement relating to
such amendment have been complied with. The Trustee may, but shall not be
obligated to, enter into any such amendment that affects the Trustee's own
rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.

Exhibit A-1










Stated Interest Rate:                            6.345% per annum

                                                 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may defer the payment of

                                                 and in each case for up to 10 semi-annual consecutive
                                                 interest periods, provided that (i) no extension period may
                                                 extend beyond the stated maturity date of the GS Junior
                                                 Subordinated Debentures; and (ii) The Goldman Sachs Group,
                                                 Inc. is not in default under the subordinated debt indenture
                                                 governing the GS Junior Subordinated Debentures. If there is
                                                 a deferral, the Underlying Securities Issuer also will defer
                                                 distributions on the Underlying Securities. Before any
                                                 extension period ends, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may
                                                 elect to extend the period further. At the end of any
                                                 extension period and the payment of all interest then accrued
                                                 and unpaid, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may elect to begin
                                                 a new extension period. There is no limitation on the number
                                                 of extension periods.

Interest Accrual Periods:                        Interest shall accrue semi-annually on February 15 and August
                                                 15 of each year.

                                                 cumulative from February 20, 2004 and will be payable
                                                 semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each
                                                 year, beginning August 15, 2004.

                                                 on the Underlying Securities but will not guarantee payment
                                                 of distributions or amount payable on redemption or
                                                 liquidation of the Underlying Securities when the Underlying

Priority:                                        Ranked equally with common securities of the Underlying
                                                 Securities Issuer.

Optional Redemption:                             The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may redeem the Underlying
                                                 Securities, in whole at any time or in part from time to
                                                 time, provided that no partial redemption may occur when
                                                 distributions are deferred. The redemption price will be the
                                                 total liquidation amount of the Underlying Securities being
                                                 redeemed, plus accumulated but unpaid distributions up to and
                                                 including the redemption date.

                                                 In addition, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may elect to
                                                 redeem the Underlying Securities, in whole but not in part,
                                                 at any time upon the occurrence of (i) changes in U.S.
                                                 federal income tax laws or regulations that could have
                                                 adverse tax consequences for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or
                                                 the Underlying Securities Issuer; or (ii) changes in laws or
                                                 regulations that pose more than an insubstantial risk that
                                                 the Underlying Securities Issuer will be required to register
                                                 as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act
                                                 of 1940. In each case, the redemption price will be equal to
                                                 the total liquidation amount of the Underlying Securities
                                                 being redeemed, plus a make-whole amount, plus accumulated
                                                 and unpaid distributions up to and including the redemption
                                                 date. The make-whole amount will be smaller if the redemption
                                                 is due to a tax or regulatory event than if it is not.

TO TRUST AGREEMENT




FORM OF SWAP AGREEMENT



(MULTICURRENCY -- CROSS BORDER)



[ISDA LOGO]




International Swap Dealers Association, Inc.




MASTER AGREEMENT



dated as of May 20, 2004



UBS AG and CABCO SERIES 2004-101 Trust (GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I)



have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a
"Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those
Transactions.


Accordingly, the parties agree as follows: --


1.       INTERPRETATION


(a)      DEFINITIONS. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will
have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.


(b)      INCONSISTENCY. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions
of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule
will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any
Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such
Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.


(c)      SINGLE AGREEMENT. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the
fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement
between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the
parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.


2.       OBLIGATIONS


(a)      GENERAL CONDITIONS.


(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each
Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement.


(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for
value on that date in the place of the account specified in the
relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in
freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in
the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other
than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due
date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless
otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this
Agreement.


(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to

(1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event
of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is
continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date
in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified
in this Agreement.



Copyright (C) 1992 by International Swap Dealers Association, Inc.






(b)      CHANGE OF ACCOUNT. Either party may change its account for receiving a
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable
objection to such change.


(c)      NETTING. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable: --


(i)      in the same currency; and


(ii)     in respect of the same Transaction,


by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make
payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and,
if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party
exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other
party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate
amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the
larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.


The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made
in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above
will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election,
together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not,
or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may
be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply
separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive
payments or deliveries.


(d)      DEDUCTION OR WITHHOLDING FOR TAX.


(i) GROSS-UP. All payments under this Agreement will be made without
any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such
deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified
by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that
party ("X") will: --


(1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;


(2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required
to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required
to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by
X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of
determining that such deduction or withholding is required or
receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;


(3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified
copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y,
evidencing such payment to such authorities; and


(4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition
to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this
Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of
Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will
equal the full amount Y would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be
required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that
it would not be required to be paid but for: --


(A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any
agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or
4(d); or


(B) the failure of a representation made by Y
pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true
unless such failure would not have occurred but for

(I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or
after the date on which a Transaction is entered into
(regardless of whether such action is taken or
brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or

(II) a Change in Tax Law.


2                           ISDA(R) 1992





(ii)     LIABILITY. If: --


(1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to
make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would
not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section

2(d)(i)(4);


(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and


(3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
against X,


then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the
liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount
of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but
including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to
comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i),
4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).


(e)      DEFAULT INTEREST; OTHER AMOUNTS. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the
extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on
demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and
including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of
actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the
basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to
the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect
of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any
obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other
party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation
or elsewhere in this Agreement.


3.       REPRESENTATIONS


Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into
and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the
termination of this Agreement) that: --


(a)      BASIC REPRESENTATIONS.

under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken
all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and
performance;


(iii)    NO VIOLATION OR CONFLICT. Such execution, delivery and

of its assets;


(iv)     CONSENTS. All governmental and other consents that are

which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or such Credit Support Document.


(d)      ACCURACY OF SPECIFIED INFORMATION. All applicable information that is

in certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing
authority as me other party reasonably directs: --


(i) any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified
in the Schedule or any Confirmation;


(ii) any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation;
and


(iii) upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document

allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment
under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without
any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such
deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion,
execution or submission of such form or document would not materially
prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of
such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and
completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and
to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required
certification,


in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if

organised, managed and controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a
branch or office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is
located ("Stamp Tax Jurisdiction") and will indemnify the other party against
any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other
party's execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax
Jurisdiction which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the
other party.


5.       EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND TERMINATION EVENTS


(a)      EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party
or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified

described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of
such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one
or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of
any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of
not less than the applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the

similar official for it or for all or substantially all its
assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or
substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution,

enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its
assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any
such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or
restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes

indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in,
any of the foregoing acts; or


(viii)   MERGER WITHOUT ASSUMPTION. The party or any Credit Support
Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with
or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another
entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or
transfer: --


(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to
assume all the obligations of such party or such Credit
Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support
Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by
operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or


(2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend
(without the consent of the other party) to the performance by
such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its
obligations under this Agreement.


(b)      TERMINATION EVENTS. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party
or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified
Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if
the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in

(ii) below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below,
and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event


6                           ISDA(R) 1992





Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional
Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below: --


(i)      ILLEGALITY. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any
applicable law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into,
or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by
any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction
of any applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than
as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party
(which will be the Affected Party): --


(1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a
payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in
respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other
material provision of this Agreement relating to such
Transaction; or


(2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such
party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the
party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit
Support Document relating to such Transaction;


(ii)     TAX EVENT. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority,
or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date
on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such
action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement)
or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected
Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the
next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the
other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax
under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section

2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount
is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax

(except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e))
and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax
under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A)
or (B));


(iii)    TAX EVENT UPON MERGER. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the
next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to
pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under

Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e),
6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has
been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in
respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional
amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in
either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with,
or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its
assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such
action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);


(iv)     CREDIT EVENT UPON MERGER. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is
specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"),
any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of
X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or
transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and
such action does not constitute an event described in Section
5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or
transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit
Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be,
immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its
successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party);
or


(v)      ADDITIONAL TERMINATION EVENT. If any "Additional Termination
Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying,
the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or
Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination
Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).


(c)      EVENT OF DEFAULT AND ILLEGALITY. If an event or circumstance which
would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes
an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an
Event of Default.


7                           ISDA(R) 1992





6.       EARLY TERMINATION


(a)      RIGHT TO TERMINATE FOLLOWING EVENT OF DEFAULT. If at any time an Event
of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an
Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however,
"Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a
party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions
will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an
Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the
extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the
institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant
petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default
specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).


(b)      RIGHT TO TERMINATE FOLLOWING TERMINATION EVENT.


(i)      NOTICE. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will,
promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying
the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and
will also give such other information about that Termination Event as
the other party may reasonably require.


(ii)     TRANSFER TO AVOID TERMINATION EVENT. If either an Illegality
under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one
Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened
Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to
its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section

6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party
to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer
within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its
rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected
Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such
Termination Event ceases to exist.


If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,
whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days
after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).


Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be
subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party's
policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into
transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.


(iii)    TWO AFFECTED PARTIES. If an Illegality under Section
5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties,
each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30
days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to
avoid that Termination Event.


(iv)     RIGHT TO TERMINATE. If: --


(1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under

Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected
with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after
an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or


(2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event
Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a
Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the
Affected Party,


either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the
case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a
Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one
Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the
case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event
if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days
notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination
Event is then


8                           ISDA(R) 1992





continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected
Transactions.


(c)      EFFECT OF DESIGNATION.


(i)      If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under

Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date
so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or
Termination Event is then continuing.


(ii)     Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early
Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section
2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be
required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of
this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early
Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).


(d)      CALCULATIONS.


(i)      STATEMENT. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following
the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the
calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will
provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable
detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and
specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving
details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to
be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a
quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of
the party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the
existence and accuracy of such quotation.


(ii)     PAYMENT DATE. An amount calculated as being due in respect of
any Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the
day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an
Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an
Event of Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after
the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case
of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a
Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the
extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well
as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including)
the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such
amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be
calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of
days elapsed.


(e)      PAYMENTS ON EARLY TERMINATION. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule
of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment method,
either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the parties fail to
designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed
that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply.
The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and
determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.


(i)      EVENTS OF DEFAULT. If the Early Termination Date results from
an Event of Default: --


(1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and
Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the
Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A)
the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the
Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated
Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the
Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the
Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to
the Defaulting Party.


(2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply,
the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if
a positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect
of this Agreement.


(3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method
and Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to
(A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the


9                           ISDA(R) 1992





Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated
Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the
Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the
Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to
the Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the
Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if
it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the
absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.


(4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss
apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting
Parry's Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a
positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the
Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the
Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that
amount to the Defaulting Party.


(ii)     TERMINATION EVENTS. If the Early Termination Date results from
a Termination Event: --


(1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the
amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section

6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section

6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case,
references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting
Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party
and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively,
and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are
being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in respect of all
Terminated Transactions.


(2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected
Parties: --


(A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will
determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the
Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be
payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the
difference between the Settlement Amount of the party
with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the
Settlement Amount of the party with the lower
Settlement Amount ("Y") and (b) the Termination
Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X
less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the
Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and


(B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its
Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than
all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect
of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be
payable equal to one-half of the difference between
the Loss of the party with the higher Loss ("X") and
the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").


If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to
X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value
of that amount to Y.


(iii)    ADJUSTMENT FOR BANKRUPTCY. In circumstances where an Early
Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies
in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e)
will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by
law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the
other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during
the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for
payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).


(iv)     PRE-ESTIMATE. The parties agree that if Market Quotation
applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable
pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the
loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be
entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such
losses.


10                           ISDA(R) 1992





7.       TRANSFER


Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that: --


(a)      a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any
other right or remedy under this Agreement); and


(b)      a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in
any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).


Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.


8.       CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY


(a)      PAYMENT IN THE CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY. Each payment under this Agreement
will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that
payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law,
any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency
will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the
Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual
receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and
in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual
Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable
in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual
Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency
payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional
amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the
shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received
exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of
such excess.


(b)      JUDGMENTS. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment
or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered

(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking
recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is
entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive
immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual
Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other
currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the
Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in
such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any
variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is
converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such
judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting
in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received
into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the
amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party.
The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs
of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the
Contractual Currency.


(c)      SEPARATE INDEMNITIES. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party
to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained
or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this
Agreement.


(d)      EVIDENCE OF LOSS. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be
sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an
actual exchange or purchase been made.


11                            ISDA(R)1992





9.       MISCELLANEOUS


(a)      ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.


(b)      AMENDMENTS. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this
Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by
a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an
exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.


(c)      SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and

6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the
termination of any Transaction.


(d)      REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights,
powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.


(e)      COUNTERPARTS AND CONFIRMATIONS.


(i)      This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in
respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including
by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.


(ii)     The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of
each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether
orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall he entered into as soon as
practicable and may he executed and delivered in counterparts
(including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of
telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic
messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all
purposes to evidence a binding supplement to this Agreement. The
parties will specify therein or through another effective means that
any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a
Confirmation.


(f)      NO WAIVER OF RIGHTS. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power
or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a
waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will
not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right,
power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.


(g)      HEADINGS. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting this Agreement.


10.      OFFICES; MULTIBRANCH PARTIES


(a)      If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party
that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home
office represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking
office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the
obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction
through its head or home office. This representation will be deemed to be
repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.


(b)      Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives
payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior
written consent of the other party.


(c)      If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any
Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through
which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction
will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.


11.      EXPENSES


A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party
for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and
Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and
protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document


12                           ISDA(R) 1992





to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination
of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.


12.      NOTICES

by the sender's facsimile machine);


(iv)     if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas)
or the equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is
delivered or its delivery is attempted; or

electronic message is received,


unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as
applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or
attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local
Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and
effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.


(b)      CHANGE OF ADDRESSES. Either party may by notice to the other change the
address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.


13.      GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION


(a)      GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.


(b)      JURISDICTION. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating
to this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably: --


(i)      submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this
Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and
the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in
New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the
laws of the State of New York; and


(ii)     waives any objection which it may have at any time to the
laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives
any claim that such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient
forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such
Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such
party.


Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in
any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed
by English law, Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or
re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of
Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.


(c)      SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent
(if any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on
its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any


13                           ISDA(R) 1992





reason any party's Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will
promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process
agent acceptable to the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service
of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.


(d)      WAIVER OF IMMUNITIES. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and
assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds
of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for
recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets  (whether before or after
judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its
revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts
of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement
between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document
with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference
Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement Transaction") that
would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of
any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or
contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent)
by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction
or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the
relevant Early Termination Date, have


15                            ISDA(R)1992





been required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of
the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be
excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for
the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction
of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to
be included. The Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation
as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The
party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference
Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable as of
the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as
reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and
time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good
faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if
each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three
quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the
quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest
values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will
be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations.
For this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or
lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than
three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in
respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions
cannot be determined.

                                           written notice of any such amendment.
