Company History: 
Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 1996, Keithley Instruments Inc. is one of the world's leading manufacturers of specialty electronic testing and measurement devices. While its sales are just a fraction of its primary competitor, multi-billion-dollar Hewlett Packard Co., Keithley Instruments has carved out a niche for itself in the high-margin, high-tech end of the electronic monitoring industry. The company's award-winning products are sold in more than 40 countries around the world and its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995. Under the direction of Joseph P. Keithley in the mid-1990s, Keithley Instruments shifted its primary focus to the fast-growing semiconductor testing market. This change in strategy was expected to rejuvenate the company's growth, which had stagnated in the early 1990s. 
Postwar Origins 
Keithley was founded in 1946 by Joseph F. Keithley, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a master's degree in engineering in 1937. After working for Bell Telephone Laboratories in the late 1930s, Keithley served at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II. At the war's end, he moved to Cleveland to take a job with Massa Labs. But when the company relocated in 1946, Keithley elected to stay on in Cleveland and establish his own company. 
His first product, the "Phantom Repeater," amplified low-level electric signals so that they could be measured by more standard equipment. The device was used by physicists, chemists, and engineers in the development of hearing aids and amplifiers, for example. Keithley later noted that the Phantom Repeater was only "a reasonable success," but it did win him a cost-plus fixed-fee contract with the U.S. Navy. 
Keithley worked alone, assembling mostly outsourced components until 1950, when he hired his first employee. Keithley added to its product line that year as well. On the advice of war buddy and Bryn Mawr head of physics Dr. Walter Michels, Joseph Keithley developed a "high input impedance DC voltmeter." Dubbed the "Model 200," this device provided researchers with a convenient way to test and measure the performance of electrical insulators--the plastic covering on a copper wire, for example. Barron's writer William M. Alpert later explained that the Model 200 could measure "how good [an insulator] was at keeping the electrical juice from spilling into where it did not belong." Keithley later told Jeff Dorsch of Chilton's Electronic News that the machine brought his young company "reasonable prosperity." 
Over the course of the 1950s, Keithley developed three primary lines of highly sensitive instruments: general purpose electrometers, microvolt meters, and picoammeters. Picoammeters, which measure electric currents in terms of picoamperes, provide a good example of the sensitivity of Keithley's devices. One picoampere equals a millionth of a millionth of an ampere, or a millionth of a millionth of the amount of current it takes to power a 100-watt light bulb. 
Fueled indirectly by hefty governmental expenditures on research during the Cold War era, Keithley enjoyed 30 percent to 40 percent annual sales growth in the 1950s, surpassing $268,000 in annual sales in 1956 and $1 million in 1960. Keithley incorporated in 1955. 
Product and Geographic ExpansionDuring the 1960s and 1970s 
During the 1960s, Keithley shifted its focus somewhat to the development of products for America's growing space program, with a special emphasis on satellite research probes. These efforts evolved into Keithley's special products division, which served such diverse disciplines as oceanography, biomedicine, nuclear energy, geophysics, and analytical chemistry, as well as industrial quality control. The company's product line grew and evolved throughout the decade, adopting digital display, for example. 
Keithley undertook foreign growth relatively early in its history. Having placed sales representatives throughout Europe by 1963, Keithley established its first overseas office in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company founded assembly and repair operations in Munich in 1966 and created a British subsidiary, Keithley Instruments, Ltd., in 1967. 
Keithley made an initial public offering in 1964 and moved to a purpose-built headquarters in Solon, a suburb of Cleveland, in 1967. Sales increased from $1.3 million in 1960 to $4.9 million in 1970. 
The company began to apply its expertise to the development of testing and measuring devices for medical and industrial applications in the 1970s. At the same time, Keithley devices were evolving to incorporate newly developed technologies like integrated circuits and micro-processors. 
In 1973, a 58-year-old Joseph Keithley set his long-term plan for transfer of corporate leadership into motion by promoting Thomas G. Brick to president. Keithley retained the chair and chief executive office. The end of the decade brought a major transformation of Keithley's corporate culture. Indeed, the company's rapid growth had spawned several problems, including excessive labor expenses, a high rate of in-warranty repairs, and poor employee relations. Worse, some managers felt that the company was not prepared for the possibility of future growth. In order to combat these interrelated problems, the company adopted a "team manufacturing approach," forming 12-person squads of employees responsible for the production of specific devices from start to finish. This strategy, which was fully implemented by 1982, reduced in-warranty repairs by 15 percent, lowered absenteeism by 75 percent, increased employee productivity by 90 percent, and helped resolve labor-management relations. 
Acquisitions in the 1980s 
This fundamental culture shift set the stage for continued growth in the 1980s, fueled in part by acquisitions and overseas expansion. Keithley broadened its global reach with the creation of subsidiaries and sales offices in Austria, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Japan during the decade. By 1988, the company had eight overseas subsidiaries and 23 international representatives, and foreign revenues constituted nearly half of annual sales. The decline of the U.S. dollar in the 1980s made Keithley's international operations evermore vital during this period of domestic recession. While much of the electronics industry suffered through one of its most difficult decades, Keithley's annual sales increased from $27.8 million in 1980 to $45 million in 1985 and $88.7 million in 1989. Profits more than quadrupled, from $1 million in 1980 to a high of over $5.4 billion in 1988. 
During the mid- to late 1980s, Keithley paved the way to what would become a key avenue of growth. In 1983, the company created a joint venture with Boston's Data Acquisition Systems, Inc. to computerize data collected by Keithley instruments. Keithley acquired the remainder of the venture in 1984 and merged it into itself as the data acquisition and control division. Having accumulated $9 million in cash by early 1987, Keithley acquired three companies with interrelated products through 1989. That year the company merged these three firms--Adaptable Laboratory Software, Inc., Macmillan Software Co., and MetraByte Corp.&mdash the Keithley MetraByte division. This division created software and hardware that converted raw data into easily read and interpreted graphics and charts. Keithley MetraByte also made highly durable "field PCs" that could endure impacts of up to 100 times the force of gravity. According to Reed Abelson of Fortune magazine, by 1989 Keithley boasted "the broadest product line in personal computer hardware and software to collect and analyze scientific and engineering information." 
The combination of acquisitions and internal growth more than doubled sales from $45 million in 1985 to over $100 million in 1990. But at the same time, profits peaked at $5.4 million in 1988, then started to slide in the waning years of the decade as defense and research cutbacks decimated the budgets of Keithley's primary customers. Annual sales eroded from $100.6 million in 1990 to $94.7 million in 1992, and net income plummeted to a loss of $12.5 million. With its core market declining, Keithley reduced its work force from 716 in 1991 to 625 in 1993. It seemed only a glitch among the mega-downsizings of the early 1990s, but put a significant damper on morale nonetheless. 
Change in Leadership and Change inDirection in Early 1990s 
In 1991 Joseph F. Keithley conferred voting control and the chairmanship over to his son, Joseph P. Keithley. The elder Keithley continued to work at his namesake firm under the simple title of "founder." He was widely recognized as "a pioneer in high-precision instrumentation." In 1992, he was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering, and in 1996 the American Physical Society created a cash award in honor of his contribution to the field of measurement and testing. 
Realizing that he could not rely on defense and research budgets for long-term corporate growth, the younger Keithley sought a new direction for his company. He found it in Keithley's own systems division, a business segment that had developed and manufactured Automated Parametric Testers (APT), devices that examined semiconductor chips for quality control, since the early 1970s. The semiconductor production process involved the creation of eight-inch wafers, each of which held about 300 individual computer chips. APTs tested the chips near the end of the production process with sensitive electrical measurements. 
In 1994, Keithley augmented that business with the $3.5 million acquisition of a new semiconductor testing technology from IBM. This new device, dubbed the Quantox Oxide Monitoring System, improved on older quality control methods on several levels. Quantox was designed to be implemented early in the production process, allowing for the disposal of inferior product before the manufacturer had invested too much in it. The device also reduced inspection time from up to five days to 15 minutes. And since it was a "contactless" process, it did not require the destruction of every wafer tested. In 1996, Joseph F. Keithley told Cleveland Magazine that "Every [integrated circuit] fabrication line in the world can benefit from this." Keithley agreed to pay IBM a royalty on each of the $500,000 machines. 
The CEO made it clear that semiconductor process monitoring would become a key aspect of Keithley's future strategy. In 1994 alone, the company invested over $1 million in development of the new device. Chairman Keithley told Crain's Cleveland Business that he expected Quantox and similar devices to become the company's most important products, bringing in $10 million to $20 million in annual sales by the end of the decade. In 1995, products sold to semiconductor manufacturers constituted one-fourth of Keithley's sales. Although Keithley enjoyed a technological edge in the realm of semiconductor process monitoring, it faced a formidable competitor in Hewlett Packard, which controlled an estimated 66 percent of the global parametric testing market. 
Investor confidence in the proprietary Quantox technology boosted Keithley's stock from less than $10 in the early 1990s to over $30 in 1995. But the stock was thinly traded; the family still owned a large proportion of the equity, and Keithley Instruments only had about 600 stockholders. In order to draw the attention of institutional investors and obtain access to more credit, the firm distributed two shares to each of its employees and encouraged existing shareholders to give their shares to a spouse in order to increase the company's float. In 1995, Keithley's shares earned a spot on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Quantox wasn't the only promising development at Keithley in the mid-1990s. By this time, the company's MetraByte division had become a key player in the emerging market for "virtual instruments:" computer components that could measure current and/or voltage, then quantify the resulting data. Individual Investor's David Sterman called MetraByte a "golden goose" at Keithley. Even the venerable instruments division bounced back, registering double-digit sales growth in 1995. 
Analyst Kevin Morrow of the Ohio Co. credited Joseph P. Keithley, who had assumed the additional responsibilities of president and chief executive officer upon the early retirement of Thomas G. Brick in 1994, with the company's newfound success. He told David Prizinsky of Crain's Cleveland Business that "There was no sales growth until J.P. took over the company a year ago. He lit a fire under everyone." That conflagration helped boost revenues to a record-high $109.6 million in 1995, when net income reached a near-record $4.9 million.

Services were held Saturday for Joseph Faber Keithley, the founder of Keithley Instruments Inc., who died Oct. 1 from complications of pneumonia, after having a stroke in 1997. He was 84 years old.

Among the men who built America's biggest test and measurement companies after World War II - William Hewlett and David Packard of Hewlett-Packard Co., Howard Vollum of Tektronix Inc., John Fluke Sr. of John Fluke Manufacturing Co. Inc. and Joseph F. Keithley - only Hewlett, who is now 86, remains alive. Among many other honors, Joseph F. Keithley received the John Fluke Sr. Memorial Award in 1985.
Although Keithley started to wind down his involvement in the company that bears his name 11 years ago, he didn't step down as chairman of the board until 1991 and he continued to serve on the board through 1997. Joseph P. Keithley, a son of Joseph F. Keithley, became chairman in 1991 under a management succession plan and now is the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Keithley Instruments.
Joseph F. Keithley is survived by his wife, Nancy, and their three children, Joseph P. Keithley of Cleveland; Elizabeth Margaret Keithley of San Diego; and Roy Faber Keithley of Austin. The family is asking for any memorial contributions to be directed to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Joseph F. Keithley 1937 Memorial Fund, MIT Alumni Fund, Room 12-090, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139.
Keithley was born in 1915 in Peoria, Ill. He earned his bachelor of science degree from MIT in 1937 and a master of science degree a year later from the same institution. He served as a member of the technical staff of Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City from 1938 to 1940. In 1940, he became an engineer at the Naval Ordnance Lab in Washington, D.C., earning the U.S. Navy's Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 1945 for work on underwater mine firing devices and developing a patented station selecting system. After the war, he moved to the Cleveland area, where he was employed by Massa Labs until opening his own business in 1946.
The founder of Keithley Instruments, a business that grew to $117.8 million in revenues for fiscal 1998, liked to recall that the first home of the company was a small workshop, renting for $8.50 a month, at the end of an alley in Cleveland. To use the bathroom, he had to go through a bar next door.
















JOSEPH F. KEITHLEY: Founded Keithley Instruments in 1946.



The company's first product was an amplifier for low-level electrical signals, dubbed the Phantom Repeater. The product enjoyed some success in sales, but it was the next product, an electrometer, that clinched the future for Keithley's fledgling company. Fifty-three years later, Keithley Instruments annually produces thousands of electrometers and other instruments and over the years it has expanded into such products as parametric semiconductor test systems. Now based in Solon, Ohio, the company employs more than 500 people.
In a 1991 interview with Electronic News, Keithley recalled that it was difficult to recruit engineers to work in the Cleveland area, as the center of activity in the U.S. electronics industry shifted from the Northeast to the West Coast and elsewhere over the decades. But Cleveland has proved to be a resilient community in recent years, building up its own high-tech base and bearing out Keithley's preference for the city by Lake Erie.
Keithley, coincidentally, died on the first day of Keithley Instruments' fiscal 2000 year. His long list of honors includes election to the National Academy of Engineering in 1992 and an IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984.

Keithley Instruments Announces Discontinuance of Its S600 Series Parametric Test Product Line | Business Wire


























































Keithley Instruments Announces Discontinuance of Its S600 Series 
      Parametric Test Product Line






February 25, 2009 06:36 PM Eastern Standard Time



CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Keithley Instruments, Inc. (NYSE: KEI), a world leader in advanced 
      electrical test instruments and systems, today announced that it is 
      discontinuing its S600 Series parametric test product line. The Company 
      will continue to accept orders for S600 Series testers until February 
      2010 and will continue to provide technical support, calibration, and 
      repair services for five years through February 2014.
    

      Joseph P. Keithley, the Company’s Chairman, stated, “The financial 
      crisis that has precipitated the global economic recession has analysts 
      now projecting capital equipment spending for semiconductor production 
      applications down 25-40 percent in 2009 after contracting roughly 25 
      percent in 2008. Device companies continue to announce push-outs of new 
      300mm fabs to 2010 and beyond from dates given earlier. Semiconductor 
      manufacturing foundries do not expect device demand to return to 2008 
      levels before 2012. Orders for our S600 Series product line serving 
      these customers have been declining now for many quarters. Based on 
      these facts and because we do not expect to be able to achieve results 
      from this product line that are consistent with our business model, we 
      have made the extremely difficult decision to discontinue the product 
      line. We remain focused on managing our liquidity and aligning our cost 
      structure with the current economic reality.”
    

      “Keithley has been serving semiconductor customers for many decades with 
      a broad range of products for research, development, and production 
      applications. Our commitment to the semiconductor industry and to our 
      customers remains strong despite this action. Although we will no longer 
      pursue fully-automated high-volume parametric test applications, we 
      remain focused on serving the industry’s R&D and low-volume production 
      test applications with our DC instrumentation, Model 4200 Semiconductor 
      Characterization System, and Automated Characterization Suite (ACS) 
      family,” stated Keithley.
    

      Sales from the Company’s S600 Series products have not represented a 
      significant portion of total revenue since mid-2007. Furthermore, the 
      product line has been characterized by quarterly order volatility over 
      the years. The Company believes that exiting this product line should 
      lessen the Company’s overall volatility.
    

      The Company currently estimates that the annualized cost savings 
      associated with this action will approximate $4 million. The estimated 
      cost of this action is expected to be between $5 and $6 million on a 
      pre-tax basis, which includes approximately $1.2 million for a six 
      percent worldwide reduction in force and approximately $4 to $5 million

      2009.
    

      Forward Looking Statements
    

      Statements in this release that are not historical facts, including 
      those relating to cost reduction measures and cost savings, are 
      “forward-looking statements,” as defined in the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve a number of risks and 
      uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results 
      stated or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of a 
      number of factors that include, but are not limited to: the Company’s 
      ability to implement and realize the benefits of planned cost savings 
      initiatives and its ability to do so without adversely affecting the 
      Company’s product development program; worldwide economic conditions; 
      uncertainties in the credit and capital markets; business conditions in 
      the semiconductor, wireless, precision electronics and other segments of 
      the worldwide electronics industry; timing of recognizing shipments to 
      revenue; the Company's ability to develop new products in a timely 
      fashion and gain market acceptance of those products to remain 
      competitive and gain market share; competitive factors, including 
      pricing pressures, loss of key employees, technological developments and 
      new products offered by competitors; the impact on the Company’s 
      shareholders’ equity as a result of discontinuing a product line and 
      cost reduction actions, including potential changes in pension plan 
      assumptions; and the ability of the Company to regain compliance with 
      NYSE continued listing standards. Further information on factors that 
      could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated is included 
      in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on 
      Form 10-Q which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
      In light of these uncertainties, the inclusion of forward-looking 
      information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company 
      that its plans or objectives will be achieved. Further, the Company is 
      not obligating itself to revise forward-looking statements contained

View full sizeScott Shaw, The Plain DealerJoseph P. Keithley, president, chairman and chief executive of Keithley Instruments in Solon, sits near one of the high-tech testing machines that the company makes. Founded in 1946, Solon's Keithley Instruments makes high-tech monitoring and testing machines used by companies that make computer chips and electronic devices. Joseph P. Keithley has been chairman, president and chief executive since 1993. These are excerpts from a chat last week between Keithley, son of company founder Joseph F. Keithley, and Plain Dealer reporter Robert Schoenberger. 

The question: You joined the company as a low-level manager when your father was still running Keithley. How did your relationship with the founder position affect your job? 
The answer: I was always careful of not trying to be someone who I wasn't. I had the mental set of manager, production inventory control. I wouldn't have lunch with [my father] or be part of the senior operating team. . . . You're a young manager, and you haven't been one before, it's easy to make mistakes. And it can really be amplified when you're the son of the boss. 
The question: Would it have been better to have gotten your first management job at a different company? 
The answer: Definitely. If I hadn't [come to Keithley], I would have had the kind of experiences that everybody else has, which really can make a difference. 
The question: What did that first managerial job teach you? 
The answer: You're working with people. You really have to put people first. They need to know what it is that needs to be done. You have to be clear with that. Don't micromanage. You establish the goal and you let them work it out. 
The question: What surprised you most about that experience? 
The answer: The power of the team. The person who is responsible for it, the manager, isn't necessarily the person with the best ideas. If he's capable, he can get his teammates to think through and come up with a better approach than any one person could do. 
The question: How do you get employees to follow your vision? 
The answer: Part of it is spending time with people. The other part is having them participate in setting the goal, then testing it, so it isn't some number that was pulled out of the air. . . . They can be good critics. You have to have them thinking, 'Does this make sense?' 
The question: In challenging times, such as 2009, how do you manage the fiscal risks of a company tied to high-growth sectors such as semiconductors? 
The answer: My financial philosophy has not been to have debt. There's enough volatility in our sales that to have a banker say at just the wrong time, 'Please pay up,' isn't anything that I want to face. We didn't have that kind of problem. . . . We had a core group of products where sales were falling. We discontinued [one product line], and we sold our RF [radio frequency] instrumentation business to a competitor. From a strategic standpoint, that caused us to have less growth opportunities for the future. [But] it's positioned us now to be highly profitable at low levels of sales. 
The question: What's the best part about being the boss? 
The answer: You get to look out over a several year period and watch the company grow and strengthen. So, you're looking forward, but at the same time, you have the pleasure of the accomplishments. 
Also, I get to watch how our products and our organization are helping change the world as the electronics industry changes. 
The question: What's the worst part? 
The answer: This last year, we reduced our work force by 25 percent or so. That's having people who were doing a good job not be with you to protect your viability. So, it hurts from a personal standpoint. It hurts because of the impact you know you're having on others. And it hurts because you have to back off from some of your initiatives that you had hopes for.
