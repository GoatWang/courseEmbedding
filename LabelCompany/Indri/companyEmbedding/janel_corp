Janel Corporation
















Welcome to Janel.
We are a publicly-traded holding company seeking to acquire and support exceptional businesses for the long term.






















Janel Corporation
















Investment Philosophy





Autonomy
You know your business, and we want you to run it -- very well. Janel has neither the ability nor desire to run acquired businesses. We do have a network of experienced business leaders who can help as needed.








The Long View
When we acquire a company, we expect to hold it forever. Janel is building a family of businesses led by people who share our commitment to long-term value creation.








People
Exceptional players build exceptional businesses. Central to Janel's buy-and-hold philosophy is a commitment to providing opportunties and support to anyone with an ambition to grow.








Ownership
We encourage our managers to choose to become owners -- we're relcutant to issue shares. This sets the stage for mutual, long-term commitment to building the per share value of Janel Corporation.























Janel Corporation














Investment Criteria






Management
We are looking for businesses with experienced, in-place management teams, especially those with individuals ready to become the business's next-generation leaders.



Profitability
We are looking for businesses that are already profitable in their niche.



Growth Potential
We are looking for businesses in need of proper support to unlock potential for greater profitability.





Industry
We consider businesses in niche industries with well-understood value chains. Industries of particular interest include non-asset based transportation, but we are open to any niche businesses that are easily understood.



Size
We look for businesses with $1m to $20m of pre-tax profits, but we will consider a deal of any size, provided it aligns well with other criteria.



Ownership
 We seek to own a majority interest in the business. We are a cash buyer.
