1 Each requirement to waive the monthly maintenance fee must occur within the statement cycle.
Debit card transactions and direct deposits must post in the statement cycle to qualify for the monthly
maintenance fee waiver. If the balance requirement to waive the monthly maintenance fee is based on
a minimum you must maintain that minimum balance each day to avoid the disclosed maintenance fee.
2 You may be subject to international service charges and surcharges on non-Columbia Bank ATM’s.
3 Military ID’s presented after March 1, 2017 will have the monthly maintenance fee waived for five
years from initial date of presentment. Student ID’s will have the monthly Maintenance Fee waived for
five years from initial date of presentment.
4 Requires enrollment in Personal Online Banking. Please refer to Online Terms and Conditions for
more information.
5 This account serves as a second chance for customers who do not meet the Bank’s checking
account qualification criteria. If after reaching one year of account opening and meet both the following
conditions of having 12 or less returned items and 3 or less deposited returned items, you will be
allowed to convert to an account of your choice.
6 Primary signer must be age 17 and younger to qualify for this waiver.
7 This account is set to a “decline all” transaction setting. To help you avoid overdrawing your account,
transactions will be declined and returned unpaid when you don’t have enough money in your account. If
this happens, you will not be charged a bank overdraft or returned item fee, but it is important to note,
you may be charged a fee by the merchant for any transaction Columbia Bank declines to pay against
your account. Based on how a payment transaction is presented to Columbia Bank and if available
balance verification was requested by a merchant, it is possible a payment could be posted to your
account resulting in an overdraft situation. However, even though your account is overdrawn, Columbia
Bank will not charge you an overdraft or returned item fee or continuous overdraft charge.
8 Combined balances are calculated using the daily balance of all deposit accounts and outstanding
balances on loans as of the business day prior to the last business day in the statement cycle. Includes
deposit accounts and loans held at Columbia Bank with similar ownership. Does not include residential
mortgage loans.
9 Refunds are processed on the next business day when the fees post to your Relationship Account.
Cashiers Check or Money Order must be debited from the Relationship Account to qualify. All non-
Columbia Bank ATM fees will be refunded if assessed by Columbia Bank.
10 Up to $15 in non-Columbia Bank ATM surcharges assessed by ATM operators will be refunded per
statement cycle.
11 Must be single Columbia Bank style checks. Benefit renews each calendar year.
12 Requires automatic payment from a Relationship Account. Credit is applied as a refund on the next
business day. One credit may be applied to one Relationship Account per year. Please refer to the Services & Fees Schedule for additional fees that may be assessed against
your account. Accounts must be open to receive refund benefits
