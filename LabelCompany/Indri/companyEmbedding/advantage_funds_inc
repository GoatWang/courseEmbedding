Helios Advantage Income Fund, Helios High Income Fund, Helios Multi-Sector High Income Fund and Helios Strategic Income Fund Announce Filing of Stipulation of SettlementHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Helios Advantage Income Fund, Helios High Income Fund, Helios Multi-Sector High Income Fund and Helios Strategic Income Fund Announce Filing of Stipulation of SettlementMarketwireOctober 18, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NEW YORK--(Marketwire - Oct. 18, 2012) - (HAV)(HIH)(HMH)(HSA) -The Helios Closed-End Funds(1) today announced that the parties to In re Helios Closed-End Funds Derivative Litigation, Case No. 2:11-cv-02935 (W.D. Tenn.) (the "Litigation") have filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee a Stipulation of Settlement. The Stipulation was submitted to the Court together with a proposed Preliminary Approval Order, which if signed by the Court, will preliminarily approve the settlement of the derivative claims filed on behalf of the Closed-End Funds in the Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the Closed-End Funds by Regions Financial Corp. and several Morgan Keegan affiliated entities, as defined in the Stipulation, in the amount of $6.0 million, less an attorneys' fee award in the amount of $1.8 million. After a hearing on the settlement, if the Court grants final approval of the settlement, it is expected that each of the Closed-End Funds' share of the settlement, after the attorneys' fee award is deducted, will be approximately the amounts reflected below, based upon an allocation of the settlement to the Closed-End Funds approved by the Closed-End Funds' Boards of Directors:Helios Advantage Income Fund, Inc.     $1,150,000 ($0.18 per share)Helios Multi-Sector High Income Fund, Inc.     $1,225,000 ($0.16 per share)Helios High Income Fund, Inc.     $850,000 ($0.17 per share)Helios Strategic Income Fund, Inc.     $975,000 ($0.16 per share)The Preliminary Approval Order, once signed by the Court, will provide for further notice of the settlement to the shareholders of the Closed-End Funds (at the Closed-End Funds' expense), and the scheduling of a hearing and any remaining proceedings. The amount of the settlement is subject to modification by the Court prior to final approval and, therefore, the amount to be paid to each Closed-End Fund is subject to change.Concurrent with the filing of the Stipulation of Settlement of the Litigation, the parties to In re Regions Morgan Keegan Closed-End Fund Litigation, Case No. 2:07-cv-02830 (W.D. Tenn.) (the "Class Action Litigation") have also filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee a Stipulation of Settlement. The Stipulation attaches a Preliminary Approval Order, which if signed by the Court, will preliminarily approve the settlement, including a release of securities claims alleged against the Closed-End Funds and the other defendants pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement of the Class Action Litigation. The Stipulation of Settlement filed in the Class Action Litigation (which also is subject to Court approval) requires that certain of the defendants make a payment of $62.0 million to a class of Closed-End Fund shareholders and does not require any payments to be made by the Closed-End Funds in connection with the settlement of the Class Action Litigation.The Preliminary Approval Order in the Class Action Litigation, once signed by the Court, will provide for further notice of the settlement to the class members, and the scheduling of a hearing and any remaining proceedings.(1) Helios Advantage Income Fund, Inc.
