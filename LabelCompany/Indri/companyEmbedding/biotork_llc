Fuel Ethanol – BioTork

























































BioTork
Evolving beyond the imagination








Fuel Ethanol


 

In this industry, substrates such as corn or sugarcane are fermented by yeast in order to make ethanol to be used as fuel. Although a promising source of renewable energy, this process is not without its challenges.
While the fuel ethanol industry is mature and produces approximately 25 billion gallons of renewable fuel per year worldwide, there is constant pressure to find new ways of optimizing production. Of course, an important way of achieving this goal is to reduce or eliminate the limitations on the process imposed by the yeasts themselves. Such limitations include:
– Poor heat and acid tolerance
– Reliance on the need to add expensive enzymes
– Poor tolerance to high ethanol titers
In short, BioTork is striving to improve the yeasts used in the creation of fuel ethanol in order to make the production of this renewable energy more cost-efficient, therefore encouraging its use over that of non-renewable fossil fuel.

Consumer Alcohol – BioTork

























































BioTork
Evolving beyond the imagination








Consumer Alcohol


 

The distilled spirits industry has seen a tremendous increase in demand, and producers are struggling to meet it. Because the processes used to ferment spirits like whiskey are largely constrained by tradition, the easiest place to improve productivity is by improving the actual yeasts that transform grain into alcohol.
BioTork has developed strains of yeast with higher alcohol productivity on real-world whiskey fermentation substrates than the standard yeasts used in the industry.

Phytase – BioTork

























































BioTork
Evolving beyond the imagination








Phytase


 


Phytase is an enzyme used in the processing of animal feed and food in order to increase nutrient availability by breaking down phytate, a non-accessible form of phosphorus with antinutrient properties. By adding phytase to animal feed, phosphorus, iron, zinc and calcium are made more bioavailable and less inorganic mineral additions to feed are needed. Not only does this shrink the costs of processing animal feed, it also decreases environmental eutrophication by reducing the amount of nutrients released through waste and contaminating the environment.
At BioTork, we have used our technology to develop a more efficient and cost-effective manner by which to produce phytase enzyme. In addition, we have been granted a worldwide, exclusive license from the University of Florida to access an extremely heat tolerant phytase. This is extremely significant because the major challenge encountered when using phytase is that, like most enzymes, it is deactivated by the high temperatures used in the processing of animal feed.
A low-cost source of heat-tolerant phytase enzymes that are unaffected by processing conditions, as BioTork is working to create, will have a huge beneficial impact on the production of animal feed, and consequently, our planet.

BioTork announces breakthrough products, safe for vegetarians

Posted by         Business Report of North Central Florida

Date: February 01, 2016
in: Featured Slider, News

BioTork, LLC, a Florida-based biotechnology company has created a sustainable, GMO-free, vegan omega-3 oil produced from algae. This omega-3 oil will be launched in the nutraceutical, feed and food industries worldwide as a direct replacement to fish oil.
Until now, the performance of algae has been either improved through genetic modification or rely on wild microbes, and generally uses a refined and costly substrate. Not only are GMOs an issue for entry into a consumer sector, but also relying on an expensive process is a major drawback for having a competitive product. BioTork’s product is naturally evolved, not genetically modified, and therefore does not carry the GMO label.
BioTork’s omega-3 oil is 100 percent from algae and can therefore be consumed by vegans and vegetarians. The algae is grown on several agro-industrial waste or by-products that are globally massively available. These substrates are completely renewable.
Eudes de Crecy, CEO of BioTork, commenting about the company’s future involvement in the omega-3 industry: “We will have the means to seriously move the lines in this global challenge of delivering alternative omega-3 sources. This will help alleviate the current supply/demand issues and contribute to a much higher quality food.”
In addition to overfishing issues, fish also accumulate mercury and other heavy metals through their diet, and therefore fish oil contains at the very least trace amounts of mercury and heavy metals. Algae does not contain such heavy metals and therefore BioTork’s omega-3 oil is free of heavy metals.
Manufacturers also often use solvents to extract DHA from oil to get higher concentrations of DHA in their products. BioTork’s oil is naturally concentrated with a high DHA content (40 percent DHA), extracted using a mechanical expelling process that results in an unaltered higher quality oil. The quality of this oil allows for market penetration in the nutraceuticals and high quality food industry for high-end applications.
BioTork’s omega-3 oil is set to hit pilot scale stage by early 2016, with demonstration and commercial production following shortly thereafter. Mr. de Crecy added about the coming scale-up stage: “Robustness is a key advantage of our development platform. We are therefore confident that the results we have in the lab will be confirmed quite easily at the industrial scale.
