 Welcome to Capozzoli Catering's Website 
Capozzoli Catering was founded in 1936, by Tony Capozzoli, in Chester, Pennsylvania. Tony and his wife Alice moved to Ridley Township in 1940, where they soon purchased a small property on Morton Avenue and opened Tony's Restaurant. Tony's Restaurant was a popular hangout for local businessmen and school kids, featuring everyone's favorite sandwich "The Tony Special". 

  In 1952, with the help and e xpertise of wife Alice, Tony decided to fully engage himself to the off-site catering business, making Tony's one of the most well-known caterers in the Tri-state area. 

  Tony and Alice had three children, Ralph, Michael and Mariann. In 1969, Ralph left his full time job at Boeing Helicopters to work with his father in the family business. After 38 years of heading his catering venture, Tony semi-retired in 1974 but always remained a huge part of the growing catering company. Soon after, in 1975, son Michael left his teaching career in the Ridley School District and joined the family's catering business, followed by their youngest child, daughter Mariann in 1980. 

  The Capozzoli Family has operated the business in Ridley Township, Pennsylvania, and has recently moved to their new location in the former Ridley High School. 

  Over the years, the Capozzoli's have catered events up to 10,000 people, including many well-know celebrities, musicians, professional athletes and politicians. 

  Currently, grandson's, Anthony, Christopher and Michael are employed full-time. Ralph's son, Anthony, joined the business in 1996 after graduating from Widener University with a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management. Michael's son, Christopher, came on board in 1998 with a degree in Food Marketing from Saint Joseph's University. Michael's youngest son, Michael, a graduate of Johnson and Wales University, earned a four-year degree in the Culinary Arts, joined the team in 2003, where he is currently the executive chef. 

  Today, after 60 years of operation, the Capozzoli Family will continue to carry on their parent's dream, and maintain the tradition of culinary expertise, personalized service and maintaining their motto, " No matter what the occasion, you deserve the best!"
