Product Description▼▲
They could not have been more different: the pipe-smoking Anglican professor and the blue-collar fundamentalist Presbyterian. Yet their unique contributions continue to shape 20th-century Christian apologetics. This insightful book compares and contrasts the thoughts of each man, assesses the strengths and weaknesses of their approaches, and applies their work to today's apologetic landscape. 200 pages, softcover from InterVarsity.

Purgatory: The Logic of Total Transformation
Jerry L. Walls Jerry L. Walls Oxford University Press / 2011 / Hardcover 
$46.25
 2.5 Stars Out Of 5 2 Reviews 


Publisher's Description▼▲
In some ways, they could not be more different: the pipe-smoking, Anglican Oxford don and the blue-collar scion of conservative Presbyterianism. But C. S. Lewis and Francis Schaeffer, each in his unique way, fashioned Christian apologetics that influenced millions in their lifetimes. And the work of each continues to be read and studied today.  In this book Scott Burson and Jerry Walls compare and contrast for the first time the thought of Lewis and Schaeffer. With great respect for the legacy of each man, but with critical insight as well, they suggest strengths and weaknesses of their apologetics. All the while they consider what Lewis and Schaeffer still have to offer in light of postmodernism and other cultural currents that, since their deaths, have changed the apologetic landscape.  This incisive book stands as both an excellent introduction to the work of these two important figures and a fresh proposal for apologetics at the dawn of a new century.


Author Bio▼▲
Scott R. Burson is assistant professor of religion at Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana. Formerly, he served as director of communications at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky. Burson has had articles published in several periodicals, including 
Jerry L. Walls is professor of philosophy of religion at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky. His annual C. S. Lewis seminar is one of the school's most popular offerings. He is also author of 


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"Apologetics can create a climate for faith. Standing on the shoulders of giants like these, we can learn to tell the Story ever more beautifully and effectively."
"Burson and Walls offer students of Lewis and Schaeffer a rare treat: fresh insights into the commonalities and dissonances between these influential thinkers, climaxed by a compelling, holistic agenda for apologetics in the next millennium."
"This is a first-rate study of Schaeffer and Lewis. It is also a splendid exploration of the issues they sought to identify and explore. Fans of Schaeffer and Lewis will be challenged to enrich what they have already found; newcomers will be drawn into a conversation of striking clarity and depth."

WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?
                                

Enough TP tubes are used each year to fill the Empire State Building, twice. With Scott® Tube-Free Toilet Paper, you can get premium softness without the wasteful tube.
