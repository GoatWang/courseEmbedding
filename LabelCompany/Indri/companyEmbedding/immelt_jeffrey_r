Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]
Immelt served as commencement speaker at Michigan State University's 2 pm ceremony on December 11, 2010, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of business.[76] He was the commencement speaker on May 23, 2010, at Hamilton College, which awarded him its honorary Doctor of Laws,[77] and on May 24, 2010, at Boston College, where he was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Business Administration.[78] He addressed the undergraduate class of 2011 of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on May 23, 2011, and received an honorary Doctor of Public Service [79] degree despite controversy at the school[80] over GE's corporate tax strategies.[81] In May 2013, he delivered the commencement address at the University of Connecticut Graduate School,[82] and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[83] In 2015 he delivered the commencement address at Siena College[84] where he was also awarded the honorary Doctor of Humanities.[85]
In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science.

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]

Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]
Immelt served as commencement speaker at Michigan State University's 2 pm ceremony on December 11, 2010, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of business.[76] He was the commencement speaker on May 23, 2010, at Hamilton College, which awarded him its honorary Doctor of Laws,[77] and on May 24, 2010, at Boston College, where he was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Business Administration.[78] He addressed the undergraduate class of 2011 of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on May 23, 2011, and received an honorary Doctor of Public Service [79] degree despite controversy at the school[80] over GE's corporate tax strategies.[81] In May 2013, he delivered the commencement address at the University of Connecticut Graduate School,[82] and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[83] In 2015 he delivered the commencement address at Siena College[84] where he was also awarded the honorary Doctor of Humanities.[85]
In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science. Clemson awarded Immelt with an honorary doctorate and Immelt spoke of how GE hired many Clemson alumni at their gas turbine factory in Greenville, South Carolina.

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]
Immelt served as commencement speaker at Michigan State University's 2 pm ceremony on December 11, 2010, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of business.[76] He was the commencement speaker on May 23, 2010, at Hamilton College, which awarded him its honorary Doctor of Laws,[77] and on May 24, 2010, at Boston College, where he was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Business Administration.[78] He addressed the undergraduate class of 2011 of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on May 23, 2011, and received an honorary Doctor of Public Service [79] degree despite controversy at the school[80] over GE's corporate tax strategies.[81] In May 2013, he delivered the commencement address at the University of Connecticut Graduate School,[82] and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[83] In 2015 he delivered the commencement address at Siena College[84] where he was also awarded the honorary Doctor of Humanities.[85]
In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science. Clemson awarded Immelt with an honorary doctorate and Immelt spoke of how GE hired many Clemson alumni at their gas turbine factory in Greenville, South Carolina.
Personal life[edit]
Immelt is married to his wife Andrea and they have one daughter, Sarah.[86] They live in Connecticut.[53] Their purchase of an apartment in New York was featured in a Forbes article.[87]

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]
Immelt served as commencement speaker at Michigan State University's 2 pm ceremony on December 11, 2010, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of business.[76] He was the commencement speaker on May 23, 2010, at Hamilton College, which awarded him its honorary Doctor of Laws,[77] and on May 24, 2010, at Boston College, where he was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Business Administration.[78] He addressed the undergraduate class of 2011 of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on May 23, 2011, and received an honorary Doctor of Public Service [79] degree despite controversy at the school[80] over GE's corporate tax strategies.[81] In May 2013, he delivered the commencement address at the University of Connecticut Graduate School,[82] and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[83] In 2015 he delivered the commencement address at Siena College[84] where he was also awarded the honorary Doctor of Humanities.[85]
In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science. Clemson awarded Immelt with an honorary doctorate and Immelt spoke of how GE hired many Clemson alumni at their gas turbine factory in Greenville, South Carolina.
Personal life[edit]
Immelt is married to his wife Andrea and they have one daughter, Sarah.[86] They live in Connecticut.[53] Their purchase of an apartment in New York was featured in a Forbes article.[87]

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the GE Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today’s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matt Cribbins
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to GE’s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our next Chairman and CEO, John Flannery; and GE Vice Chairman and CFO, Jeff Bornstein.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that our earnings release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our website at www.ge.com/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff Immelt.
Jeff Immelt
Thanks, Matt. GE had a solid quarter in a volatile world. Let me give you a few themes that describe the environment. U.S. is stable on a slow growth rate, global growth is accelerating, and resource markets remain challenging. Out topline results are solid. In the second quarter, our organic results were: Orders up 5%; revenue up 2%; margins expanded by 10 basis points; and industrial profit grew by 4%. At the half, orders were up 6%; revenues up 4%; margins expanded by 70 basis points; and industrial profit grew by 11%. At the half, we reduced structural cost by $670 million ahead of plan. We generated $3.5 billion of cash in the quarter, in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we made progress on our portfolio strategy. July, we closed GE Baker Hughes. This move significantly strengthens our position in the sector. This is a more competitive business and positioned for growth. We closed LM, a critical vertical integration move for wind business. LM is already improving growth and margins. We remain on track to close the sale of Water in third quarter and Industrial Solutions by year end. And we see good strategic and operational synergy with Alstom.
Overall, we have no change to our 2017 framework. John will update you on his views for 2018 and beyond, later in the year. Our orders have been strong, up 8% year-to-date and 6% in the quarter. We saw strength in both equipment and service. We grew backlog by $3 billion. We continue to see pricing pressure in oil and gas; we have slow industry with excess capacity.
Let me give you a few order highlights that we consider most noteworthy. Aviation was up 14%, really an amazing performance. At the Paris Air Show, we announced $30 billion of commitments, 10 times our nearest competitor. Oil and gas equipment orders grew by 50%; this includes one of the few big project deals in the industry with Eni in Mozambique. Renewables were up 12% behind some big global deals. We’re gaining share in Europe. We took orders for 9 H turbines in the second quarter with 33 in backlog. Global orders were up 11% and represented 66% of our total. Nine of 12 regions experienced growth with China up 26%, India 36% and Europe up 35%.

Transportation signed an LOI worth $575 million for locomotives in Egypt. Digital orders were up close to 40%. At the half, Meridium orders were up 86% and ServiceMax orders grew by 101%. Healthcare created a collaboration with partners for artificial intelligence solution. And in service, aviation spares grew by 14%, military grew by 28% and power received a $3 billion service commitment for power plants in Algeria. There is no doubt that we’re outperforming competition in many markets and gaining share, this is in time is building our install base for the future. With this order rate and backlog, we feel great about the 3% to 5% organic growth for the year.
Organic revenue was up 2% and margins were up 10 basis points in the quarter. Year-to-date organic revenues up 4% and margins were up 70 basis points; service revenues up 8% year-to-date. So, here are some key revenue highlights.
Global revenue was up 7% with growth in nine of 12 regions; Europe grew by 15%; China by 16%; India by 35%; and MENAT by 15%. For the half, we had organic service growth in all segments. We’re gaining share with our products. LEAP has an unprecedented advantage in the market. We believe that GE has greater than 50% share in the gas turbine market and the market for H. In wind, we’re gaining share in Europe for the first time. Healthcare closed a number of big enterprise deals for both healthcare solutions and life sciences. Our new cell therapy business grew by 37% and our mammo business where we’ve launched new products, grew by 20%. Digital revenue growth was 17% and we see this accelerating through the year.
Let me give you some perspectives on our margin performance. As I said earlier, our structural cost is $670 million year-to-date with strong performance in the business and corporate; we expect to beat our $1 billion goal. We had a $150 million of non-repeat items that impacted our oil and gas, and power businesses; Jeff will review these in the segment reviews. We grew equipment in few areas that are dilutive in the CM rate in the short-term but open up service growth in long term; these include the H and LEAP products and the power balance plan. This was expected and reflected in our margin goals for the year. In the second half, we’re targeting 120 basis points of improvement to generate 100 basis points for the year. This kind of second half expansion is typical for GE. We see sustained revenue growth and structural cost out helping us to achieve this goal. In all, we expect to hit the EBIT target we’ve discussed in the past.
For cash, CFOA was $3.5 billion in the quarter, $2 billion from capital and a $1.5 billion from industrial CFOA, in line with expectations. Here are some of the main drivers from industrial CFOA.
Net income was actually below last year due to increased restructuring cost not covered by gains, working capital performance was very good, up a $1.5 billion from a year ago, and a $700 million improvement in the quarter. We saw improvement in receivables, inventory and progress, which was partially offset by lower payables. Contract assets were a drag but better than a year ago. The second half CFOA profile will be a lot like last year. We expect higher earnings. We expect to reduce working capital by about $4 billion in the second half. Last year, this was actually more, it was $5 billion. Contract assets will grow at about the same level and we will benefit from timing of other our items. We ended the quarter with $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet, in line with expectations. And we should be within the $12 billion to $14 billion goal for industrial CFOA.
Now, over to Jeff.
Jeff Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff.
Starting with consolidated results. Revenues were $29.6 billion, down 12% in the quarter; industrial revenues of $27.1 billion were also down 12%. As you can see on the right side of the page, the industrial segment was down 2% on a reported basis but up 2% organically, driven principally by the appliances disposition.

Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.28, down 45% versus the prior year, driven by substantial appliance gain in the second quarter of last year. We had $0.06 of restructuring with no gains in the quarter versus $0.11 of net gains after restructuring last year. Operating EPS was $0.19 in the quarter, down from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2016. This incorporates the other continuing GE Capital activity, including excess debt and headquarter runoff costs that I’ll cover on the GE capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.15 includes the impact of non-operating pension; and net EPS of $0.13 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $152 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital Exit Plan item. GE tax rate was 13% in the quarter; we still expect the ongoing operations of the business to have a mid teens tax rate for the year. However, the Water disposition will be a low-tax transaction and will bring the overall tax rate for our industrial to around 10% for the third quarter and about that for the total year. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on a pretax continuing loss.
We had a better cash quarter. CFOA was $3.5 billion, including $2 billion dividend from GE Capital and industrial CFOA was $1.5 billion in the quarter. It was up $3.1 billion from the first quarter and up substantially from the second quarter of last year. At the half, industrial CFOA is $200 million usage. We expect substantial improvement in cash in second half driven by higher earnings, continued working capital improvement on higher shipment, partly offset by contract assets. For the year, we are guiding to the bottom end of the $12 billion to $14 billion range on CFOA, driven by pressure principally in power, and oil and gas.
John and I are reviewing our capital allocation plan for the year. Dividend remains our priority. We are relooking the $11 billion to $13 billion range on cash use for buyback, based on the timing of disposition. Year-to-date, we bought back $3.6 billion of shares.
On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, the industrial segment revenues were down 2% on a reported basis and up 2% organically. For the half, the industrial segment revenues were up 4% organically. Industrial segment op profit was down 4% reported and down 1% organically; and industrial op profit which includes corporate operating cost was down 1% reported and up 4% organically. The demonstrated industrial op profit and industrial plus vertical EPS year-over-year is driven by the effects of restructuring the appliance gain and associated tax impacts of appliance. Through the half, industrial op profit of $6.8 billion is up 4% reported and up 11% organically. On an EPS basis, we’ve earned $0.48 of EPS, which is $0.62 excluding the first half naked restructuring. Given our outlook on oil and gas and power, we are trending to the bottom end of the range of $1.60 to $1.70 EPS for the year.
Next, on industrial and other items for the quarter. As I said, we had $0.06 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were little more than $700 million on a pretax basis. This was slightly less than expected driven by lower cost to execute projects and short-term timing delays on projects we will likely execute here in the third quarter.
Corporate, power, renewables, healthcare, and oil and gas had the largest investments in the quarter. Restructuring charges totaled about $500 million and BD charges were approximately $200 million mostly related to Baker Hughes news the LM Wind acquisition, Water diposition as well as the Industrial Solutions disposition and the digital transaction. There were no gains in the quarter.

For the year, we expect about $0.25 of restructuring to be offset by $0.25 of gains from the Water and Industrial Solutions dispositions. We’re targeting a third quarter close for the Water transaction and the fourth quarter close for Industrial Solutions. The Industrial Solutions transaction may push to early 2018, but our plan is to do $0.25 of restructuring this year. We’ll update you on deal timing as we get closer.
Next, I’ll cover the segments, starting with power. Our recorded orders of $7.7 billion, down 1% in the quarter. Excluding the large Halcyon steam order in the second quarter of last year, orders actually grew 11%. Equipment orders were down 1%, but up 33% ex the Halcyon order. Gas power system was up 26% on higher H turbine order of nine versus five last year and six HA units booked in Mexico, our first in the account. The H backlog totaled 33 units. HRSG orders grew a 100% to 10 versus 5 a year ago. Offsetting GPS was steam power, down 42% with no repeat of that Halcyon order, which totaled about $800 million. Equipment backlog grew 27% year-over-year. Service orders were down 1%, primarily driven by lower AGPs in the quarter of 20 versus 24 last year, and the larger mix of light AGPs versus full scope and by lower outages which were down 9%; this was partially offset by growth in installations and other upgrades. Service backlog grew 7% year-over-year.
Power revenues were up 5% to $7 billion. Equipment revenues were up 12%, driven primarily by gas power systems up 17% on higher scope balance of plant and higher HRSG ship of 10 versus 4 last year; this was partially offset by lower gas turbine shipment of 21 versus 26. Service revenues grew 1%, our distributor power services up 10% offset by flat power service. Power service is flat on lower outages, and fewer and lighter scope AGPs, 21 versus 28 offset by higher other upgrades which were up 42%.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 10% on higher equipment versus services including higher balance of plant volume at low margin. Fewer AGPs and lower variable cost productivity which was partly offset by structural base cost down 7%. Lower VCP in the quarter was impacted by about $70 million of liquidated damages with delivery delays and fuel mod cost of about $20 million that we don’t expect to repeat going forward. The business is finding opportunities for growth. We took nine H turbine orders in the quarter. We also booked the largest services deal in the history of the business, the $3 billion Algeria deal with Sonelgaz that included 68 AGPs. This showed up in backlog, not orders in the quarter.
However, we’re planning for a down market this year. We expect the power market to see demand for about 40 gigawatts of power this year, down about 10%, consistent with what we said in March. We’re also planning for a down market in 2018. We expect to ship a 100 to 105 gas turbines in the year, no change in that outlook. We believe that we have a technology advantage relative to competitors and we’re gaining share. Having said that, the market is very competitive, and overcapacity and new product introductions will continue.
For services, we expect 2017 now to just to be down about 4%, driven by F-class major outages, which we think will be down about 9% as a result of lower utilization, lower capacity payment, particularly North America and extended intervals between outages. This is softer than we expected coming into the year. We are targeting total upgrades to grow and AGPs to total between 155 and 165 for the year. However, we have got a risk of 20 to 30 driven by timing of large second half AGP deals that are yet to be agreed to.
The first half, the business is up 10% on revenues and higher by 7% on operating profit with margin rates down 50 basis points. Power has taken out around $143 million of structural base costs to date and we are continuing to work additional actions on cost for the year.

Next is renewables. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, up 2% reported and down 2% organic. Onshore wind orders of $1.7 billion were down 5%, driven by lower repower orders and services. Onshore equipment orders were higher by 4% on strong international winds. The number of units ordered was 567 versus 637 last year, down 11% but the megawatts grew 12% on larger machines. Hydro orders of $250 million were up 38% and LM at 80 million of water orders in the quarter. Revenues were $2.5 billion, up 17%, up 13% organic. Onshore revenue grew 12% and hydro grew 79%. Onshore was driven by the repowering product that we introduced last year. Wind turbines shipped totaled 757 versus 856 last year, down 12% but the megawatts shipped were 8%. Operating profit of 160 million was up 25%, driven by repower volume, better product cost and foreign exchange, partly offset by price.
Margin rates improved 40 basis points. The wind market continues to be very competitive, product cost out is absolutely imperative and the team has made progress on the 2 megawatt platform and need to execute the same on the same 3 megawatt turbine as we begin to deliver that machine. LM will be critical to drive cost and differentiation going forward. This business is on track with double-digit growth and improved margin rates for the total year.
Next, on aviation, the market continues to be robust. Global passenger RPKs grew 7.9% year-to-date through May with strong growth on both domestic and international routes. Airfreight volumes have been very strong as well, growing up over 11% May year-to-date. And load factors globally are above 80%.
Orders in the quarter totaled $7.3 billion, up 14%. Equipment orders grew 11% and services grew 15%. Within equipment orders, commercial engine orders grew 35% to $1.9 billion on higher LEAP GE90 and GE9X order. These orders did not conclude any of the Paris Air Show announcements we made. Military equipment orders of $292 million were down 48%, driven by no repeat of an order last year for 212 T700 helicopter engine.
Service orders grew 15%, as I mentioned with commercial services higher by 16% on strong spears of 14% to $21.6 million a day and strong military services growth of 14%. Backlog finished the quarter up 2% to $159 billion. Revenues in the quarter were flat at $6.5 billion. Equipment revenue was down 16%, driven by commercial down 15% and military down 39%. Commercial engine shipments were lower by 10% on pure legacy engines, partly offset by higher LEAP volume. The business shipped 93 LEAP engines in the quarter. Service revenues grew 13% on higher commercial spares up 14% and good military performance including our military spares. Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 11%, primarily driven by higher service volume and base cost productivity which more than offset the negative LEAP margin. Margins were 210 basis points higher in the quarter. At the Paris Air Show, we announced $31 billion in orders and commitments including new engine commitments $ 21 billion and services up $10 billion. None of these announcements were booked in orders of the second quarter.
In additive, we announced the development of the world’s largest laser powder machine targeted to the aerospace segment. We also announced a partnership with Stryker r to provide machines, material and services for the global supply chain operation. The LEAP engine continues to perform to spec with 62 aircraft flying today. The business is on track to ship 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year. The business is executed well in the first half. As LEAP shipments accelerate in the second half, we expect the margins to be pressured and still expect total year margin rate to be roughly flat with 2016.
Next, on oil and gas. We closed the combination of our legacy oil and gas business with legacy Baker Hughes in July 3rd. The new company’s listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BHGE. In September, Lorenzo and his team will give you an update on the outlook of the new company and the progress on integration and synergy. Today, we will discuss only the results of GE’s legacy oil and gas business and not the results of legacy Baker Hughes business.

The oil and gas environment remains challenging. Our legacy business sees some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitment. Oil prices remain volatile and as a result our customers remain cautious. As we’ve said previously, we expect shorter cycle activity to increase in the second half of the year. So, far these improvements are tending below our expectations. Orders in the quarter of $3.2 billion grew 12% versus last year and grew 14% organically. The equipment book-to-bill ratio was 1-to-1 for the first time in the better part of two years. Equipment orders totaled $1.4 billion, up 50%. Every business segment grew. Subsea was higher by a 177% on orders in Brazil and the Eni Mozambique Coral project. Turbomachinery was up 14%, also driven by the Eni Coral scope and service orders grew 57% on strength of the Middle East. We had terminations in the quarter totaling $542 million, driven predominantly by one project scheduled to deliver beyond 2018.
Service orders were $1.8 billion, down 6% on softer markets, driven by turbomachinery down 13%, surface down 11%, subsea down 6%, partially offset by strong performance by digital solutions, which grew 6%. Total backlog ended the quarter at $20 billion, down 12% versus last year. Revenues of $3.1 billion were down 3% versus last year. Equipment revenue was down 8%, driven by subsea down 31% which more than offset growth in surface up 12% and turbomachinery up 3%. Service revenues were flat year-over-year.
Operating profit of a $155 million in the quarter was down 52%. Performance was driven by unfavorable price and negative variable cost productivity that more than offset sourcing and structural cost out. On variable cost productivity, I put the impacts in two categories. First, we had two big one-time items. Rework on a nonrecurring issue related to a single contract totaling about $30 million and a write-down obsolete inventory for about $25 million. Second, lower volume impacted both overhead absorption and supply chain benefit. We also had $25 million of integration costs in the business in the quarter.
As the market recovery’s been slower and more volatile than we planned, performance of the business in the second quarter was below expectation. Customers are delaying purchasing for both, larger projects and shorter cycle OpEx activity. Given the slower market activity, we expect that numbers in the second for legacy GE Oil & Gas to be lower than previously anticipated but improve from the first half. The business is very-focused on the synergy pipeline with the integration in order to offset as much of the market pressures possible. 
Beginning with third quarter results, BHGE will release its own financial statements and hold a separate earnings call. We will consolidate Baker Hughes GE into our financial statements less than 37.5% minority interest.
Next on healthcare. Orders of $5 billion grew 3%, 4% organically. On an organic basis, the U.S. was up 1%, Europe was up 2% and the emerging markets grew 11%, driven China up 18%, ASEAN up 15%, Latin America grew 5%; the Middle East actually declined 6% organically in the quarter. On a product basis, healthcare systems orders grew 3%, 4% organically, driven by ultrasound up 8% and imaging products higher by 4%. Mammography and CT were particularly strong on the new product launches. 
Life Care Solutions was flat, driven by the impact of healthcare reform uncertainty in the U.S. market. Our Life sciences business grew orders 5% organically, with core imaging up 8% and bioprocess up 5%. Revenues in the quarter of $4.7 billion grew 5% organically. Healthcare systems grew revenues 5% organically and life sciences grew by 8% organically. Operating profit was up 6% in the quarter to $826 million, driven by volume and productivity, partially offset by price and programs for product cost reduction. Margins improved 30 basis points in quarter.

We expect the second half performance to be similar to the first half with low to mid single digit revenue growth with stronger operating profit growth. The business is executing well and we will continue to simplify structure to drive lower product cost.
On transportation, North American carload volume continues to improve off a low base. Carload volume grew 7.3% in the quarter, driven by intermodal higher by 5.6% and commodity carloads up 9%. Commodity carload growth was driven by export coal up 18% and agriculture up 10%, partially offset by petroleum down 4%. Despite improving trends since mid-2016, overcapacity remains in parked locos around 4,000 and very little investment appetite from U.S. customers.
Orders in the quarter of $830 million were higher by 22% on easy comparison. Equipment orders of $231 million doubles on international demand for 26 locos. Service orders of $600 million grew 7%, a good growth in loco parts and mining. Revenues of $1.1 billion were down 14% with equipment down 27% and services flat. We shipped 120 locals in the quarter versus 222 a year ago with international shipments up 34%, partly offsetting North America which was down 77%.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 26% on lower volume, partly offset by cost actions. The North American locomotive market will continue to be challenging in 2017 and 2018. We expect 2017 loco shipments to be lower by about 50% with operating profit down double digits since we’ve guided. The business is focused on growing internationally. The business recently announced a $575 million win in Egypt for a 100 locos plus service. We expect this to book as an order in the third quarter. Executing on resizing the business to market has been ongoing and we continue to evaluate additional actions as needed.
Next on energy connections and lighting, orders for the segment totaled $3 billion with energy connection orders of $2.6 billion and current orders of $380 million. The energy connections orders were down 12% reported and down 7% organic, driven by grid down 8% on no repeatable large Egypt order and power conversion down 14%, offset by 1% growth in the industrial solutions. Revenues ex appliances were reported down 2% but up 2% organic. Energy connection revenues were higher by 4% organic on strength in grid and industrial solutions, partly offset by power conversion. Lightning revenues were down 9% with current down 2% and legacy down 17%, as a result of the market exits and restructuring we’ve been doing over the past year.
Operating profit in the quarter was $80 million, up over 400% ex appliance. Energy connection nearly doubled profits to $68 million on grid and industrial solutions performance and productivity, partly offset by power conversion on weak volume. Lighting earned $13 million versus a loss last year. As announced, energy connections will be consolidated with power in the third quarter which we believe will create significant opportunity for future structural cost out. We’ll provide recast date, once we finalize it in the third quarter.
Finally, I’ll cover GE Capital. The verticals earned $544 million in the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher base earnings. GECAS, Energy Finance and Industrial Finance all had strong quarters and they delivered a solid first half of the year. They execute ahead of the plan on their 2017 guidance.
In the second quarter, the verticals funded $1.9 billion of on-book volume and enabled approximately $3.9 billion of industrial orders. Overall, portfolio quality remains stable. Other continuing operations generated $716 million loss in the quarter driven by $343 million of excess interest expense, a $182 million of preferred dividend, $146 million of restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and $45 million of headquarters run-off expense. Other continuing was $335 million better than last year, driven by lower excess interest and lower headquarter cost.

Discontinued operations generated a $152 million loss from trailing costs and exit plan related items. Overall, GE Capital reported a net loss of $324 million, 72% better than last year. GE Capital paid $2 billion in cash dividends during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $4 billion and ended the quarter with a $160 billion of assets including $37 billion in liquidity, down $7 billion from the first quarter. 
Looking ahead, during the second half of the year, we expect lower asset sale. And as a reminder, we will conduct our annual impairment review with GECAS in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will perform our annual cash flow test of our run-off insurance business. We recently have had adverse claims experience in a portion of our long-term care portfolio and we will assess the adequacy of our premium returns. We will update you in the fourth quarter. Lastly, in other continuing operations for the second half of the year, we continue to expect incremental tax benefit associated with recovering a portion of the exit plan tax cost we incurred.
With that, I’ll turn it over to John.
John Flannery
Thanks, Jeff. I just wanted to give you a quick update on our transition process. As you know, my official start date is August 1st. And we’d indicated earlier that I’d be doing a full review of the Company and be back to investors in the fall with my views. We are on track with this process. I am in the middle of a series of deep dives into each of the businesses, looking at everything you would expect. What is the market outlook, where can we grow, where can we improve margins, how is the cash conversion, what returns are we getting on investment? For example, next week, we will be visiting our power and aviation businesses. We are also taking a hard look at our corporate spending, going through a zero base budget exercise on all of our functions and making sure 100% of our GE store outlays are accretive to the overall results of the Company.
In addition to the business reviews, I want to repeat the process I used in healthcare to really get out and listen to what people are thinking, good and bad about the Company. I always start with customers and employees, but it’s also important to get the view of our government partners and especially our investors. As I was out with Matt Cribbins last week and we saw about 100 different analysts and portfolio managers, and we will be doing more of that over the next couple of months. There is a lot of positive feedback from these listening sessions but also plenty of suggestions on ways we can improve. This is all leading to a report out in November. Our main focus then will be translating the business assessments into our thoughts on cost out and capital allocation choices as well as reframing our look at 2018 and beyond. I’m really excited to get started officially on August 1st and look forward to our ongoing dialogue.
So, Jeff, back to you to wrap.
Jeff Immelt
Thanks, John. Overall, we have no change to the framework but there are puts and takes in each area. We see the key elements of earnings to be on track, 3% to 5% organic growth and 100 basis points of margin enhancement. We have pressure in power, and oil and gas but we’ll outperform structural cost out. We’ve set a target of $17.2 billion for industrial EBIT and we expect to hit it, even with those headwinds.
Jeff discussed the impact of additional pressure from the resource sector could have on the EPS range earlier. We expect to hit $16 billion to $20 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions. We still expect to have solid industrial CFOA between the $12 billion to $14 billion, again somewhat dependent on the resource sector. Our dispositions are taking longer than expected but we have to close both in the year. I expect John to take a fresh look at capital allocation, but GE will always have a strong commitment to the dividend.

Let’s take a bigger picture view of the Company. We have created a very strong position in power, healthcare, transport and resources, big industrial segments. We don’t like the current on a gas cycle but our business is significantly improved and will prosper as the cycle recovers. We are gaining share in most of our markets with $327 billion of backlog. We have a leadership position in the industrial internet and additive manufacturing, two growth areas and drivers of industrial productivity. And in volatile global economy, our industrial EBIT plus the earnings from our GE Capital verticals should be about $19 billion and again generate between $16 billion and $20 billion in the free cash flow plus disposition. So, a pretty good performance in the volatile environment.
I know John Flannery can improve on this. John is off to a great start and I look forward to working with him.
Matt, now over to you for some questions.
Matt Cribbins
Thank you. With that let’s open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. 
Julian Mitchell
My question would really be on the CFOA for the year coming in at the lower end of the $12 billion to $14 billion guidance, sounds like that’s mostly power, and oil and gas. So I wondered if you could give us some transparency around what is the cash conversion or free cash flow margin like in those two businesses in 2017. And when you think about their cash flow performance this year, how much do you think it’s weighed down by short-term one-time factors? In other words, how quickly do you think it can spring back to an acceptable level of cash flow in those two businesses?
Jeff Bornstein
Yes, Julian. So, we expect the power business to deliver a positive CFOA in the year for sure as well as oil and gas. And we actually oil and gas to have -- relative to the environment they are operating in and how do we see their second half, a reasonably good performance around CFOA for the year for oil and gas. So, the power business is going to be something like 50% to 60% conversion in the year; other businesses will be higher. Healthcare will be closer to 100%; aviation will be quite good. But I would guess that power is going to be somewhere between 50% to 60% conversion for the year.
Jeff Immelt
I would also add, Julian. We’re doing $2 billion of cash related to restructuring. A lot of that’s in the power sector. None of us expect that to repeat in 2018. So that’s a natural tailwind, let’s say in terms of CFOA in 2018.
Jeff Bornstein
So, why don’t I walk from the first half to the second half a little bit in terms of kind how we’re thinking about it. There is no doubt we have a big second half to deliver on cash, and that’s similar to where we were last year. Relative to the first half, there is really three big drivers. One, we’ve got higher earnings, in line with our volume; our cost-out profile; and gains versus restructuring. In the first half, we had a $0.14 headwind; in the second half, with the gains, we’ll offset that $0.14 headwind and have -- $0.14 offset in earnings. We’ll have significantly better working capital performance. Although I think we feel pretty good about the second quarter. We generated $700 million in CFOA in the second quarter from working capital and that was almost $1.5 billion better than where we were in the second quarter of last quarter. I think importantly within that there was a couple hundred million of inventory improvement, which I don’t think we’ve ever realized in the second quarter of any year in recent history.
As we look to the second half, the working capital will get better, largely driven by inventory, a bit by payables and we’ll have some receivables improvement. And that’s consistent where we were last year. So, working capital last year, we improved in the second half, better than $5 billion; we’re not anticipating $5 billion but looking more at just under $4 billion improvement this year. So, we think we’ve executed before, we can execute again in a similar way.

And lastly, on contract assets, we still expect contract assets to be a cash usage in the second half but not nearly the rate that we saw in the first half. And we expect it will look very similar to the change in contract assets in the second half of last year, which was about $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion.
So, if you look at second half cash flow versus 2016, we delivered $11 billion of CFOA in the second half of last year. We need to do about $1 billion more this year, which is primarily a function of earnings. And we expect working capital to be about $3.9 billion better in the second half. So, the total improvement for the year of about $3.3 billion and that’s less than the $5.1 billion of working capital improvement we had in the second half of last year. As I say contract asset has been a little bit of drag in the second half but in line with where we were in the second half of last year.
And I’d say lastly, other operating, all the other elements of cash flow will be better in the second half than the first half and will be better substantially versus 2016. So that’s kind of how we think about going from the first half to the second half.
Jeff Immelt
And also say, Jeff, in 2016, we ran the place with a couple of $3 billion less working capital. We’re into the same thing in 2017. But I think the team -- there is a lot of juice in this left. And I think we have every expectation that we’re going to be able to continue to reduce the amount of working capital that’s needed to run GE in the near future.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.
Andrew Kaplowitz
So, could you give us a little more color on what you are seeing in power? You mentioned trending toward the bottom of your EPS range for the Company, I think despite a lower tax rate. And power specifically, is services overall just a tougher market than you thought? You talked about the delays you are seeing in services, but how much of the power weakness would you say is execution related and how much low-hanging fruit does Russell have to improve delivery timing and overall execution of the business?
Jeff Bornstein
So, I guess I’ll start, others can way in. I would say, generally, I think the units market on the equipment side is more or less what we thought it would be. We said -- we saw 40 gigawatt market, down 10%. In that context, we said, we thought we’d take orders for 85 to 95 units in the year; we still think that holds, we’ve got about 39 units during the first half. We said we thought we’d ship 100 to 105; we think that’s still a reasonable expectation. And we talked about the gas turbine business, the units business turning around profitability from the launch last year to this year, and we still expect that holds true. I think on the service front, I think it definitely is softer than we thought when you look at outage volumes. We thought outages were going to be down mid single-digits. Right now, it looks like particularly in the gas base and on the bigger F-class outages, we’re running about 9% down year-over-year that’s partly driven by utilization, it’s partly lower capacity payments, it’s partly extending intervals between outages, but that feels softer. So, the transactional business, which is 50 plus percent of the business, that feels softer than where we came into the year.
But, I’ll put it little bit in perspective, I think having said that, to the first half revenues in the business were up 10%; operating profit was 7%; there is definitely some execution there. I talked about 90 plus million of LDs and a fuel mod that we had to do, we don’t expect those to continue. The 70 million of LDs were really around prelaunch H unit where we took a little bit of risk on schedule and commission and not having been through the process, and it took us a bit longer to get there. We feel like we’re absolutely on track on the balance of the H commitment. So, we don’t expect the LDs to continue.

And then, when you think about total year, we still think about the power business being up mid single digits on revenue and up roughly high to low double digits on earnings. I just think that in the backlog of everything we have got in front of us here that it does feel softer. The business still thinks, they are going to do 155 to 165 AGPs in the year. But I think the mix of light AGPs versus full scope AGPs is a higher -- the mix of light is heavier than we probably anticipated coming into the year. And then I talked about in that estimate on AGPs. We have some risk. We have got some really big deals in the second half that could put 20 or 30 of those units of risk. I’m not telling you the business doesn’t think they are going to deliver them. I’m just highlighting for you, there could be a risk there. So, definitely service is softer than maybe we came into the year with. I think the units business is more or less as expected. And it’s gas outrages on the service side, lower steam and boiler work on the outage side in services. But overall, if we can get to a year that’s kind of up mid single digits on revenue and high single digits to low double digits on op profit, everything else being equal, not too bad.
Jeff Immelt
And I would add to that Andrew. As you put the energy connections business together with the power business, you’re going to look at a funnel of maybe another $1 billion of structural costs you can take out of the combined business, rolling into 2018. So, I think to add to Jeff, there is probably close $100 million that shouldn’t repeat that we should have done better in the quarter. I think the profile for the year is still going to look attractive for the segment. And I think the team has a nice cost -- is developing a good cost plan going into 2018 that I think should create a buffer against the market.
Jeff Bornstein
There is both, an opportunity and necessity to restructure the cost structure of this business, given the market that we are operating in. And I expected that the business on their structural cost commitments is going to over perform in 2017. And as Jeff just talked about, we are building a plan around something close to a $1 of structural cost out of 2018.
Operator
Next, we have Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague
Jeff Immelt. Good luck and thanks for all your thoughts and insights over the year, much appreciated.
Jeff Immelt
Jeff, you and I have done this a long time. I’m going to miss you and I look forward to having a beer with you as a citizen someday, as civilian.
Jeffrey Sprague
I’d like to do that definitely. Just on cash flow, I guess maybe perhaps for Jeff Bornstein. The first half obviously came in short of what you thought; you thought you would kind of equal last year at roughly $400 million. I wonder if you could also decompose what the source of that may be roughly $600 million shortfall was. And just your comment on share repo, are you linking the conclusion or execution of these divestitures to your share repurchase plan or what variable is really driving the reevaluation of the repo? Thank you.
Jeff Bornstein
So, I think what I said on the call, maybe I misspoke on the call. What I meant to say on the call was we expected the CFOA in the second quarter would be substantially better sequentially from the first and substantially better than the second quarter of last year. I didn’t mean to say that we would be flat year-over-year. I think generally speaking at $1.5 billion, $1 billion of CFOA, we felt pretty good about that. Would we have liked it been A bit higher? Sure. But I thought the inventory performance was pretty good, the receivables performance was pretty good; payables were used in the quarter maybe a little higher than we expected but that’s partly driven by the cost-out that’s happening and the inventory improvement. So, I think at a $1.5 billion that was reasonable performance. And it puts us pretty close to where we were at the half. You were right, we’re down 600 year to date year-over-year but that was included in the context of how I kind walked you from how we think about going from the first half to the second half total year and with that means for working capital and other cash flow improvement we expect to see.

On repurchase, I think our share buyback has always been predicated on dividends from GE Capital and the disposition. So, no change in there. I think that there is a risk that industrial solutions won’t happen in the year. It’s hard for me to exactly handicap. But, I think there is at least an equal probability that will happen in the first quarter of 2018 it will happen in the fourth quarter of this year. As I mentioned earlier, we feel pretty good about the fact that Water will get to a closing here in the third quarter.
So, having said all of that, I think as part of John’s relook about what we’re doing, I think John wants to go back and rethink about how we think about capital allocation in the Company and embedded in that obviously is how we think about share buyback. So, we’re being open objective and John wants to take a look at it and really work through with the team what the right way forward is and what the right alternatives are.
Jeff Immelt
I hate to be a broken record but there is -- Jeff, there is $2 billion of cash associated with restructuring in 2017 that’s probably a $500 million or $600 million more than 2016 and that should mainly not repeat going into 2018. So that’s in these numbers. And I would just eco what Jeffery said about capital allocation what John should do. The only other context I’d give you though is that everybody here prioritizes the dividend in a very high -- at very high level. And I just don’t want anybody to ever be confused about that in the context GE, what we do, how we do, and whoever CEO is how we think about that as a context. I was here the day we cut the dividend, it was the worst day of my tenure as CEO and the dividend is really I think incredibly important for our investors and for the team.
Jeff Bornstein
Just one point of clarification on the restructuring cash. So, yes, we’ll probably spend slightly more than $2 billion in cash on restructuring in 2017. Everything else being equal, I’m trying to avoid giving the 2018 guidance here before John’s gone through framework, but we would expect to spend substantially less than that in 2018 but it won’t be zero. There will be projects we do in the third and fourth quarter that allow cash that spills over. 
Operator
Thank you. Next we have Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray
For Jeff, congrats and best wishes on your last earnings call, and we are expecting to hear good reports about improvements in your golf game. A question for John. So, given the management transition and now the mid-November timing for the reset and the new vision for the Company, how can you minimize the effects of GE being in somewhat of a state of limbo until then, for want of a better word?
John Flannery
Listen, we are going through a process that we’ve laid out for you guys. It’s a substantial process in a large company that takes a commensurate amount of time. I’d say Jeff and Jeff have laid out a framework for the year already, so there should be no change in thinking around that. And then, we’re spending a lot of time internally with the team. So, I would say there is no risk of limbo inside the team. I actually start August 1st, but there’s a lot of interaction already. So I’m not worried about internal paralysis, if you will. And you have our outlook for the year. So, I look forward to the November -- a robust discussion in November about the Company and not worried that we’re going to be dead in the water in the meantime.
Jeff Immelt
And I think the teams are still executing against their AIP plans, their LTIP plans. There is a ton of operational focus inside the Company that investors can count on while John’s going through his kind of an over to the top review.
Jeff Bornstein
I would just -- if you don’t mind, John, I would just add. It’s an enormous company, it’s complex. We want to reground, rebaseline everything we do in this company, how we do it, the value of the GE store, how it creates value in our franchise. That’s a big, big body work, as well as understanding portfolio and John getting deep on and developing his own views about what we’re going to invest against, what we’re going to not invest against et cetera. So, I understand the point completely Deane. I just think that’s a meaningful body of work and I think when John gets up in front of investors and shares his views, we want that to be as absolutely as well informed as possible. So, I just think it takes that amount of time. But I understand your point between now and then there’ll be a lot of people speculating on how John might come out of it.

Operator
Thank you. Next we have Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin
Yes, good morning. Jeff, thanks for all the work over the years. Look forward to work with your successor. Thank you very much. Just a question on power, the outlook for 2018, just sort of talking about lower and thinking about Siemens’ commentary, is it cyclical or is something structural going on in terms of outlook for power?
Jeff Immelt
I think Andrew, if you look at a micro study like IEA, which or EPE [ph] study of the industry things like that. These would show slow but steady increases in the evolution around natural gas really for the next 20 years, right, in terms of additions to capacity and things like that. And you can triangulate that against whatever your assumptions might be on accelerating penetration of solar, reduction of nuclear. There is a whole series of things over the next five years or 10 years or 20 years. But I think what’s clear is with the ongoing outlook for the cost of natural gas, gas turbans and gas power generation are going to be one of the staples of the future of the industry. Now, does that mean 50 gigawatts, instead of 40 gigawatts in the short-term, I don’t think any of are that smart. You’ve got places like Saudi Arabia that used to be the biggest gas turbine market that have been slower over the last couple of years; they’re going to need capacity; there is -- what does China do, vis-à-vis their environmental issue. There is probably five markets that matter that would make it more on the upside, but I actually think there is a fit for the gas market going forward.
That being said, I don’t think there is benefit to Jeff or John or to Russell now to be overly bullish about the near-term kind of dynamics around the industry. But at the same time, I think somewhere in the 40ish area is pretty much where I would think about the industry going forward. And then outrages that Jeff went through, this is going to be a function of kind of renewable mix; it’s going to be a function of hot summer, cold winters, price of coal, price of gas and bunch of other things. But, I think there is reasons to believe that that number stabilizes as time goes on.
Jeff Bornstein
Andrew, I think that when we get up in November, we will share our view of where we think the power business is going for 2018 and to some degree beyond that. We think the power market this year for gas turbine can be 40 gigawatts, that’s down roughly 10%. It might be down again next year. I think so far the business is competitively been in a good place. We’ve seen a little bit of price but we are definitely outperforming competition on both, price, orders and share. When John is deep in the business and develop the view with Russell on where this is going, we will share that in November.
Jeff Immelt
I think you are sitting, though, Jeff, in a year where equipment means [ph] is going to be --- the power equipment is going to be 10% or something? It’s going to be high. Let’s put it that way. That doesn’t spell disaster, I don’t think.
Operator
Thank you and our final question comes from Chris Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Chris Glynn
I just had a question on the contract accounting long-term service agreements. Wondering if there is an update on the accounting change impact next year and also if there is any view to somehow monetizing the LTSAs in a way that’s different from the past?
Jeff Bornstein
So a couple of things, one is I don’t have an update for you today on the 606 accounting change. We are working it rigorously. When we have an update as to the impact to 2016, 2017 and a relook at what we think the impact might be in 2018, we will share that with you. Right now, we are going through first quarter actuals and auditing those and making sure we’ve got the processes in place to deal with all the changes. So, I don’t have any change in guidance for you on that. I don’t have an update other than we are going through the mechanics in the process. It’s pretty complicated stuff, particularly around LTSAs.

On monetization, listen, I’m -- particularly where there has an interest in putting upgrades or other investment into a contract, if there are capital markets solutions to help customers do that and were pricing for that as opposed to us essentially pricing it, I’m wide open on that. Those structures are not simple. But we continue to explore what those might be. We have done a little bit of it. We have done some of it for sure, but mostly focused around how we think about upgrade. And the variable component where it’s utilization based, it’s very difficult to think about doing something around that, but if you’ve got fixed payments embedded, like for an upgrade, that is something that we can think about doing.
The last thing I’d tell you just -- in the quarter, nobody asked but our CMRs or LTSA gains in the quarter were $500 million; they were $600 million in the second quarter of last year. So, they are down 100 million year-over-year.
Matt Cribbins
Okay. Thank you. And just a reminder that the replay of today’s call will be available this afternoon on our investor website. And Jeff, to wrap up your last call.
Jeff Immelt
Great, Matt. So, the first time I did this, all we did was fax a press release, and that’s been replaced 64 subsequent times by this incredible work. So, it shows you I’ve been doing this a long time or how much times have changed. I would like to publically thank the GE finance team led by Jeff. You guys have no idea how much work goes into this. Matt, thanks for your great effort. By JoAnna especially you, it’s been great to work with you for so many years. And I just want to all of our investors to appreciate the incredible work that goes into this. We’ve always tried to be respectful, transparent and honest in this process. I’m looking across the table at Jeff Bornstein; he’s got a six-inch binder. He knows every fact and everything to do with the Company. And I feel great about John Flannery and what he is going to do with the Company and going forward. So, again, I’m sure I’ll see many of the investors over time. But I want to use this as an opportunity to do a shout out for the GE team and what great work they do. Thank you. Great.

GE's stock falls as Jeff Immelt's 64th and last quarter is another disappointment
BY MarketWatch— 10:03 AM ET 07/22/2017


  Shares suffered the worst one-day post-earnings performance in over four years
  Shares of General Electric Co. (GE) tumbled to the lowest close in nearly two years on Friday, as outgoing Chief Executive
Jeff Immelt ended his reign of the industrial conglomerate with a downbeat outlook.
  But Friday's share weakness may come as little surprise to long-term investors. The company (GE) has lost about $170
billion in market value while Immelt has been in charge, according to FactSet data, which is more than the value of 14
of the current components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. .
  Friday's selloff marked the eighth-straight quarter the shares declined on the day results were reported. The 2.9%
drop was the biggest one-day post-results decline since it fell 4.1% on April 19, 2013.
  The stock had initially rallied after GE's second-quarter report was released (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-
stock-gains-after-profit-and-sales-beat-expectations-2017-07-21), to be up as much as 1.8% at about 6:45 a.m. ET, as the
company handily beat profit and sales expectations. The stock trended lower leading up to the post-results conference
call (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-stock-turns-sharply-lower-after-ceo-immelt-gives-downbeat-outlook-on-
conference-call-2017-07-21), with the stock down 0.9% just before the call started.
  See also: GE cuts costs buy shares hit by weak outlook (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ge-cuts-costs-but-shares-hit-
by-weak-outlook-2017-07-21).
  Immelt said the recovery for the oil and gas market has been "slower and more volatile" than what was planned, and has
customers have been delaying purchases, he expects results for the legacy oil and gas business to be "lower than
previously anticipated," according to a transcript of the call provided by FactSet.
  For the power business, GE's largest by revenue, Immelt said the company was planning for a "down market" this year
and for 2018.
  "Given our outlook on oil and gas, we are trending to the bottom end of the range of $1.60 to $1.70 EPS for the year,"
Immelt said.
  The FactSet consensus for 2017 adjusted EPS is $1.62.
  Analyst Jim Corridore at CFRA, which acquired S&P Global's equity and fund-research business last year, followed by
downgrading GE to hold from buy, and by cutting his stock price target to $27 from $36. "With oil and gas weakness
overshadowing strength in aerospace and health, we now think there are better investment choices with likely higher EPS
growth prospects in the industrial sector," Corridore wrote in a note to clients.
  Some investors seem to believe GE's fortunes may improve after incoming CEO John Flannery takes over on Aug. 1. When
the CEO change was announced on June 12, the stock surged 3.6%. Since the announcement, however, the stock has plunged
10.5% to close Friday at the lowest price since Oct. 2, 2015.
  Don't miss: General Electric (GE) CEO Immelt will step down after 16 years at the company (http://www.marketwatch.com/
story/general-electric-ceo-immelt-will-step-down-after-16-years-at-company-2017-06-12).
  As MarketWatch previously reported (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-stock-is-the-worst-dow-performer-since-
immelt-took-charge-2017-06-12), the stock has been the Dow's worst-performing component during the 16 years Immelt has
been in charge. The year-to-date decline of 18.0% makes it the weakest Dow stock this year.
  If there is a silver lining for investors, GE's stock is currently the lowest priced within the Dow, which means it
has the least influence. The 78-cent, or 2.9% drop shaved just 5 points off the price of the Dow, which lost 32 points.
See Market Snapshot (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nasdaq-win-streak-in-doubt-as-stock-futures-limp-ahead-of-ge-
honeywell-2017-07-21).
  By comparison, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s stock fell just 1.0%, but the $2.12 price drop took over 14 points off the
Dow.
  Immelt ended Friday's conference call by thanking the GE finance team, and by saying he just wanted investors to
appreciate the "incredible work" that has gone into the 64 quarterly reports that have been released since he was in
charge.
  "So, again, I'm sure I'll see many of you investors over time, but I want to use this as an opportunity to do a shout
out for the GE team and what great work they do," Immelt said.

                In the final installment of our two-part interview, General Electric chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt explains what’s driving the company’s evolution, how he leads, and why he’s different from Jack Welch.
            


























Video 



Jeff Immelt formally took the helm of General Electric in September 2001. There’s no question the world has changed dramatically in the 14 years since, but what about the company? In this interview with McKinsey’s Rik Kirkland, Immelt explains how the industrial giant has evolved: selling major lines of business, investing in data and analytics, and becoming, in Immelt’s words, only as broad as it is deep. At the same time, he reveals how he has changed as a leader and why he believes the command-and-control style of his predecessor, Jack Welch, wouldn’t work today. An edited transcript of Immelt’s comments follows.
Interview transcript

We were 70 percent inside the United States when I became CEO. Today, we’re just massively more global, and we have to be strong in these industries. We have to be able to get 30 or 40 percent market share in China in our healthcare business. I would contend it’s hard to be focused on getting 40 percent market share in your healthcare business and still worry about a media enterprise in the United States at the same time. Those two tasks were maybe this far apart in the 1980s [holds fingers apart] and are this far apart in the 2010s [holds arms far apart]. This notion of being only as broad as you are deep is the way you have to think about how you run a company today.

Evolving a corporate giant

If you look at some of the things we’ve done over the past, let’s say, five or ten years, what we try to do is reflect on both where we think markets are going and also on what we think our core competency is. And my assessment of the world is that we’re really in this period of slow growth and volatility. There’s just not a lot of tailwind; you have to make your own tailwind, and, as a result, depth matters. In other words, if you look back on the ’90s, it wasn’t that anybody did anything wrong, but you had so much tailwind you could be broader than you were deep. What we’ve tried to do is narrow our focus as a company, to be only those things that have significant core competency.

So that’s led us into being a global infrastructure leader. We think we’re playing to the company’s strengths, and, at the same time, we’re playing to those things that the world needs—that have some robustness and some buoyancy. That’s led us to be more global. It’s led us to be more technical. It’s led us to exit media, shrink financial services, and be in those things that can play in what we call the GE Store: technology, globalization, and those things that we think are core to the company.

We’re a narrower company—we’re still huge—but we’re a narrower company, and we’re a deeper company. And we’re playing into this global infrastructure need, which maybe doesn’t have a robust tailwind every day, but, over the long term, I think we’re playing into those things that the world needs.
The GE Store

Globalization is uniquely a big-company game. In other words, when I go to China, when a new GE team goes to China, they have 20,000 people who are GE employees in China. We have 100,000 in Europe. So you never travel alone. It’s a “one company” strategy, and, so we’re very clear, we call all of that the GE Store. The store of capability. Now, I think NBC is a good business, was a great business. High margin. The people who ran it are great. But they never shopped at the store. They never wanted to be in the store. They never brought much to the store. Basically, we have the portfolio that fits the store. And that’s how we think about the horizontal capability for the company.
Leadership with less control

You never go through a process of leading anything, particularly in the time period we’ve been in, without learning a lot and changing a little bit. And what I’ve now seen in terms of the job itself, I would say the CEO of a company like GE has to be all about change. It has to be all about picking what’s next, getting the company focused, making the company accountable. I think that was true then, and it’s true today. I would say that’s critical.

The most important thing that happens with tenure is you just become more humble. I’m a better risk manager, a better learner, a better questioner. There’s just no way you can ever enter the job with enough humility. You never lose your sense of optimism, you’re just more reflective on everything that happens.

The world’s just so doggone different today than it was 10, 15, or 20 years ago. I would say no matter what you’re running, you control fewer things. And so you need to be more resilient. Jack was a great CEO, but he really controlled his world. It was a centralized kind of command-and-control company. Those days are over. I’m in the risk-management business. Governments are more active. The world is more difficult. You’re not in the control business today, you’re in the risk-reward business.

(Pat Sullivan/AP)  General Electric said Monday that its longtime chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, would retire at the end of this year, closing out a 16-year run at the helm of the industrial giant, which included a vast overhaul of the conglomerate's portfolio but also an underperforming stock price that has trailed well below market indexes and competitors. General Electric is the only remaining member of the original Dow Jones industrial average, created in 1896 by Charles Dow. And running GE remains one of the most high-wattage jobs in Corporate America. In the past, its very makeup — electric lightbulbs, appliances, NBC — gave GE a touch point to hundreds of millions of Americans and consumers worldwide. Because of its size and ability to generate cash, the U.S. economy and the millions of pensioners, savers and investors have depended on the success of the General Electric stock price and dividend — whether they knew it or not. On Immelt's watch, GE has been the Dow's worst performing stock among companies that haven't gone bankrupt or left the group of blue-chip stocks. Immelt’s inability to move that stock price — it fell by more than a quarter during his tenure — was thought by many to be his undoing. "Why the change? Two words: stock price," said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners. “There is no question. The board and shareholders have given Jeff Immelt a long time. He was CEO for almost 16 years in one of the biggest upmarkets cycles in history and the stock has underperformed." Immelt, 61, will be succeeded on Aug. 1 by John Flannery, the current president and chief executive of the company's health-care business, and will remain chairman until the end of the year. The company said that the announcements were part of a succession plan that had been in place since 2011, and that now was an “ideal time for change” as the company has completed its “pivot” away from financial services and the move of its headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston. In an interview Immelt put it this way: "The average tenure of a CEO is eight years. This is twice that. That's plenty." The company appears to be trying to turn a new page with Wall Street. Jack Brennan, former CEO of Vanguard who is the lead independent director on GE's board, said in an interview that "what's been led by Jeff is what John will build upon." "John brings a set of financial skills and a mind-set around returns and returns on investment that is very strong," he said. The company's announcement comes amid recent pressure from the activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management, which had pushed GE to cut costs and change up the executive compensation bonus plan. Trian Fund had no comment on the leadership change. Before Monday's news, the company's shares have fallen 12 percent since Jan. 1, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had climbed 9 percent. During Immelt's tenure, GE's total return with dividends included was about 12 percent; while the S&P 500 during the same period returned nearly 192 percent, with dividends included. Immelt has been closely watched from even before he took over. He and two other GE executives, Robert Nardelli and Jim McNerney, were forced to undergo a very public “bake off” to succeed the larger-than-life Jack Welch. Immelt ultimately earned the job, making him only the 9th chairman in GE's 125-year-history. Nardelli left to run Home Depot, then Chrysler. McNerney had successful subsequent careers with 3M and, until recently, Boeing. The company is widely considered a farm system for future executives of major U.S. corporations. Welch was known for his singular mission: increasing the stock price. He and a cadre of similar executives during the 1980s and 1990s were known for their devotion to maximizing shareholder value. Many U.S. corporate executives in the decades following World War II strayed from that religion, with the result helping to spur the advent of takeovers, buyouts and other financial devices designed to increase corporate bottom lines. General Electric stock jumped 1 percent on the news of Immelt’s departure Monday morning, signalling Wall Street’s positive reception to the change. “His managerial decisions resulted in investing in projects that did not maximize shareholder value,” said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland. “Did he choose the right portfolio of projects to maximize shareholder value? I question whether he did.” Others see Immelt’s tenure in a favorable light. “Jeff Immelt is unfairly criticized for not doing enough for GE shareholders,” said Michael Farr, an investor and president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a Washington, D.C. firm. “In fact, he provided an excellent transition from the Jack Welch magical, do-no-wrong leadership and a highly leveraged balance sheet to a more conservative firm able to weather and endure." Many observers believe Immelt was dealt a difficult hand. The timing of his arrival to the job could not have been worse. He took over as CEO just days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The surprise attacks brought American business and airline travel to a halt, with far-reaching impact on GE’s jet engine business. Moreover, says William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann, Immelt had to rebuild $10 billion in loss reserves in the company’s reinsurance business, an early hole that forced him to curtail capital spending and reinvestment in growth early in his tenure. Then there was the 2008 financial crisis, in which GE Capital -- one of the company’s biggest moneymakers by that time, accounting for roughly half its net income -- turned into a liability. Heymann said real estate investments prompted Immelt to get "caught at the wrong place at the wrong time," exacerbating the tough conditions he'd inherited. "He worked through a lot of challenges," he said. "He never had a chance to have the wind at his back when the road was flat." "In many ways financial services has been the biggest [negative] dynamic on the company," Immelt said. At one point, GE went hat in hand to investor Warren Buffett, who lent the company $3 billion in the depths of the crisis on terms that were very beneficial to Berkshire Hathaway. General Electric paid the money back in 2011, including a $300 million bonus, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. GE's competitors faced the same sort of head winds, and Honeywell, run by a former GE executive, David Cote, has thrived. Immelt has made dramatic changes to GE's business, not only through completing $260 billion in asset sales for GE Capital over the past two years, but in taking on big acquisitions and divesting out of businesses such as GE Appliances, NBC Universal and GE Plastics. Immelt said the company's industrial businesses -- as diverse as locomotives, complex highly technical health care devices, oil fields services and turbine manufacturing -- "have done phenomenally well over the last 15 years." "He leaves a solid company with an honorable, ethical reputation," Farr said. "He worked hard and did well. He gets very high marks from me.” Flannery, 55, has been at GE since 1987 and led the acquisition of Alstom, the largest industrial acquisition in the company’s history. During his tenure leading GE Healthcare, the company said, he has increased organic revenue by 5 percent. "It's fair to say none of us are happy with the price right now and want to move that up," Flannery said. Ultimately his success will be viewed on his ability to appease shareholders and put the stock price back on an upward arc, something Immelt was simply unable to do. “You can’t say it was greedy, obnoxious, impatient shareholders," Feinseth said. "They gave him 16 years.” Read also: Jack Welch bashes Trump for 'crappy management practices' Like On Leadership?

Jeffrey Immelt, C.E.O. since 2000, has pared down General Electric to rely less on financial wizardry in its lending unit and more on physical products from the manufacturing divisions.

TO train its future leaders, General Electric has rising young stars study and visit an array of different organizations, from Google to West Point.What can managers at the 132-year-old industrial giant learn from Google? A corporate mind-set that prizes “constant entrepreneurship,” says Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chairman and chief executive, during an interview at his corporate headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.And what wisdom is on tap at the United States Military Academy? “Adaptability” and “resiliency” amid uncertainty, says Mr. Immelt — skills as vital to surviving in business as they are on the battlefield.Strategies are useful, he says, but only if they can quickly adjust to nasty real-world surprises. “In the words of the great philosopher Mike Tyson,” Mr. Immelt says, smiling, “everybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth.”

Perhaps no company outside of the banking sector was hit as hard by the financial crisis as G.E., certainly none that seemed healthy before the economic tailspin. Its big finance arm, GE Capital, long a cash machine that bolstered the mother ship’s bottom line, became an albatross, threatening to pull down the entire enterprise. G.E. cut its dividend for the first time since the Great Depression, lost its triple-A credit rating and hastily arranged a $3 billion investment from the billionaire Warren E. Buffett.

Having skirted disaster, G.E. is recovering gradually these days. Its finance unit is on the mend, with the size of its debts and troubled loans trending downward. Mind you, middling recoveries are a relative matter at G.E. After all, the company remains a colossus on track to deliver profits of more than $10 billion on sales of about $150 billion this year. But investors are used to getting more from G.E., which earned $22 billion on revenue of $173 billion in 2007.So G.E. has revamped its strategy in the wake of the financial crisis. Its heritage of industrial innovation reaches back to Thomas Edison and the incandescent light bulb, and with that legacy in mind, G.E. is going back to basics. The company, Mr. Immelt insists, must rely more on making physical products and less on financial engineering — a path that, he insists, is also necessary for the American economy as a whole.Mr. Immelt candidly admits that G.E. was seduced by GE Capital’s financial promise — the lure of rapid-fire money-making unencumbered by the long-range planning, costs and headaches that go into producing heavy-duty material goods. Other industrial corporations were enthralled with finance, of course, but none as much as G.E., which became the nation’s largest nonbank financial company.The big buildup of GE Capital occurred during the tenure of Mr. Immelt’s famous predecessor, Jack Welch. But while Mr. Immelt, who took over in 2001, spun off the unit’s insurance business, he also bulked up on commercial real estate and other loans. In 2004, G.E. even bought a subprime lender in California, WMC Mortgage, which it shed in 2007 for a $1 billion loss.IN the buoyant years before the credit crisis, the company’s finance arm contributed nearly half of G.E.’s overall profits. When Mr. Immelt had qualms about the unit’s risks, he sought outside opinions, including ordering up a study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in 2007.Sixty days later, the consulting team, he says, told G.E. that money from nations with a trade surplus, like China, and sovereign wealth funds, among other investors, would provide enough liquidity in the financial system to fuel lending and leverage for the foreseeable future. (McKinsey declined to comment on the study.)Mr. Immelt and his advisers had plenty of company in missing the gathering storm.“But clearly,” Mr. Immelt concedes, “GE Capital was too big in the context of G.E.” Going back to the early 1990s, he explains, anticipated returns — not so much market expertise — guided investment decisions. If a deal looked like a money spinner, he says, it got the nod. “And you don’t have to build a factory,” he adds.

Today, the financial unit is becoming smaller and focusing on fields where G.E. believes it has a competitive advantage. Those specialty areas include industries in which G.E. has a strong manufacturing presence, like power generation, aviation and health-care equipment, and lending to midsize industrial companies. Unless a deal is in a business where G.E. has distinctive skills, Mr. Immelt says he won’t let GE Capital dive in.“We’re not going to do it, whether there are supernormal returns or not,” he says.He’s most animated talking about heavyweight products that take patience and piles of cash to develop, weigh tons and last for years — next-generation jet engines, power turbines, locomotives, nuclear plants, water-treatment systems, medical-imaging equipment, solar panels and windmills. Mr. Immelt notes, for example, that the cost of a good-sized solar-panel plant, about $70 million, is more than twice the total investment in Google in the six years before it went public in 2004.The costs and complexities of such businesses, he adds, make it hard for just any company to compete. These are markets, he says, that have “big moats. They’re tough to get in.”The big-moat businesses can also be quite lucrative. Mr. Immelt points to G.E.’s jet-engine business as an example, saying that it has higher profit margins and returns on capital than the leading banks. “It doesn’t happen every quarter or every year,” he says. “But over a 10- or 20-year time period, the businesses that are hard to do had the best returns. So the arithmetic works over time.”Technology-based manufacturing of all sorts, Mr. Immelt says, has to be a central part of reinvigorating the economy. In speeches and position papers, Mr. Immelt, a member of the White House’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, has called for doubling manufacturing employment in America, to 20 percent of the work force, which he concedes is an “aspirational” goal.Making progress, he adds, will require significantly improving the nation’s prowess as an exporter. G.E., by the way, happens to be America’s second-largest exporter, after Boeing. So Mr. Immelt’s views about what changes would benefit the economy would probably help G.E. as well.“Many bought into the idea that America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption-based economy — and somehow still expect to prosper,” Mr. Immelt said in a typical speech last year before the Detroit Economic Club. “That idea was flat wrong.” He added: “Our economy tilted instead toward the quicker profits of financial services.”Mr. Immelt is backing his words with actions — plans announced over the last 18 months include the creation of more than 4,000 jobs in manufacturing production and research in the United States. They include new factory jobs in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Alabama and Mississippi, for making products including energy-thrifty washers and dryers, fluorescent light bulbs, sodium batteries, environmental coatings and jet engines. And the company is opening a research center in Michigan for advanced manufacturing technologies.

“The underlying DNA of G.E., going back a century, has been to invest for growth in its technology base,” says Noel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan business school who once ran G.E.’s management school in Crotonville, N.Y. “So by increasing R.& D. spending and with investments in manufacturing, Jeff Immelt is going ‘back to the future’ at G.E.”ABOUT 1,000 miles from corporate headquarters, inside a gleaming new plant that is the result of a $100 million, three-year investment, G.E.’s back-to-basics strategy is on display.The spotless factory, in Batesville, Miss., spans 300,000 square feet — about five football fields — and cranes and bulldozers are already working on a 40,000-square-foot addition. The site makes strong, lightweight composite parts for a new generation of more fuel-efficient jet engines. Initial production began last year. It is an industrial symphony of materials science, high-tech machinery and hand craftsmanship. Computer-controlled machines cut carbon-fiber fabric precisely, but, as if it were in an industrial bakery, the fabric still has to be kneaded into shape and into molds by hand and then cured and baked in giant ovens.The parts are for new versions of fuel-efficient, quieter engines that will be used in wide-body, long-haul planes like the Boeing 747-8 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Passenger and cargo carriers have 1,300 of these engines on order, and about 80 percent of the production is for export.For each job at the factory, there are about 30 applicants. The payroll has more than doubled this year, to 220, and is on its way to 450 by 2012. Everyone dresses in blue short-sleeve shirts with a G.E. logo and dark pants. Production is organized around the concept of “high-performance work teams,” typically six to 12 workers.It’s a bottom-up approach that shuns hierarchy, and places most of the responsibility for continuous improvement on the teams. An egalitarian ethos is reflected in the job titles. The boss, Jeanne Edwards, is the “plant leader.” Line workers are called “production associates.” There are no supervisors here, only “leaders” and “coaches.” There aren’t many of those anyway — all but 29 workers are hourly employees, and production associates start at about $35,000 a year.The team approach seems to be working. Workers and coaches steadily look for ways to tweak the production process for greater efficiency. Since production began last year, the manufacturing “cycle time” — from cutting carbon-fiber fabric to shipping a finished part — has been reduced by 80 percent, says Antroine Townes, 27, an engineer who guides process-improvement efforts.To get hired at the Batesville plant, applicants must first take a reading, math and problem-solving test administered by the state employment agency. Candidates who do well are then invited for interviews at the plant and are evaluated in team settings. For example, they are placed in groups of four and told to assemble a Lego helicopter in 15 minutes.

“We want to see how they interact, how they work together,” says Terry Collins, the plant’s human resources leader. “We don’t give a heck about making the helicopter.”The workers hired so far come from varied backgrounds, some from more regimented factory settings. Recruits from traditional factories, says Ms. Edwards, the plant leader, “often tend to have some trouble at first.”Audra Harris, 36, left a job as a machine operator at a commercial roofing manufacturer to come to the G.E. plant. In her first months, Ms. Harris says she initially found the team approach “very challenging,” but adapted quickly. “Here you get to make a lot of decisions,” she says.Steve Lentz, 55, who had worked in a printing factory and a bottling factory before joining G.E, says the large investment in a high-tech facility proved that the company had a long-term commitment. “I figured I could wrap up my career here,” he says. “At other places, you don’t know when the shoe will drop.”Jeffrey Parker, 29, was hired last year. A college graduate, he had never set foot in a manufacturing plant before and had worked as a mortgage broker for Countrywide Financial.He says his perception of manufacturing work was laborers tethered to machines, doing boring repetitive tasks in grimy factories. “I had a real rough, blue-collar view of what manufacturing life is like,” he says. “It’s not like that here.”

MR. Immelt says his broadest responsibility at G.E. is to “drive change and develop people.” Any executive who wants to change things, he says, should be guided by “a point of view about what’s going on in the world, and you invest around that point of view.”One big trend that corporations must embrace, he notes, is the “reordering of the global economy.” In a talk to students at the Stanford business school this year, Mr. Immelt observed that when he was a young executive moving up the ranks at G.E. in the 1980s, developed nations accounted for 80 percent of worldwide economic growth. In the coming decade, he told the students, emerging markets are expected to deliver 80 percent of global growth.Under Mr. Immelt, G.E. has sharply expanded its overseas sales, to $81 billion last year from $51 billion in 2001. But the company has fallen short of some of its ambitious goals for even higher growth, especially in markets like India and China. To accelerate the growth abroad, Mr. Immelt last month reassigned John G. Rice, a vice chairman, to Hong Kong, where he will oversee sales, marketing and operations outside the United States.

Mr. Immelt has expressed frustration about the difficulties of doing business in China, especially in industries that Beijing has marked as priorities to the nation’s economic development. In a meeting with a group of Italian business executives in Rome in July, he told the group, according to The Financial Times: “I really worry about China. I am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win, or any of us to be successful.”G.E. has said the remarks were taken out of context and do not represent the company’s view.And Mr. Immelt now offers a more subtle assessment, saying that China is too large and complex to approach in a cookie-cutter way. “I defy anybody to say they have a one-China strategy,” he says. “I defy anyone.”In some markets in China, he says, G.E. will be guided solely by whether Chinese rivals are weak or strong. But in industries like solar and wind power that are a focus of Beijing’s five-year economic plans, for example, competitive tactics need to be fine-tuned to adapt to state policy.“Is it a strategic industry or one that is going to be allowed to commercialize on its own?” Mr. Immelt says.The approach to China, he says, isn’t so different from the approach used in foreign markets where G.E. has been for decades and prospered. “Is France a completely open market to G.E.? No, of course not,” Mr. Immelt observes. “I think we’re more discerning about China because it’s China, and they’re big and they’re more concerning. But the best global companies are ones that are nuanced.”Being nuanced in foreign markets, he says, is a skill that “I think we’re pretty good at.”Mr. Immelt also sees himself as the champion of what he calls “large-scale entrepreneurship” at G.E. By that, he means identifying long-term market shifts — “what’s next,” he says — and then marshaling the company’s research, manufacturing and marketing resources to capitalize on the opportunity. He firmly believes that corporate size, when focused, can be a crucial advantage in the high-tech industrial markets where G.E. competes.“It’s about using the scale of G.E., the majesty of the company, to drive growth and change,” he says.Mr. Immelt’s leadership style, according to colleagues and advisers, is a blend of analysis, encouragement, cajoling and sometimes orders by decree. He grew up in Cincinnati, where his father, Joseph, once managed G.E.’s aircraft engine business. He attended Dartmouth College, majored in applied mathematics, was elected president of his fraternity, and played tackle on the football team.

Next came a short stint at Procter & Gamble. Nearby sat another aspiring business leader, Steven A. Ballmer, now chief executive of Microsoft. Mr. Ballmer recalls Mr. Immelt as bright, energetic and engaging company during after-work dinners and bar-hopping. After little contact for years, Mr. Ballmer says the two have “really reconnected” in the last decade after they both became chief executives of leading American corporations, getting together for dinners and rounds of golf, sharing thoughts on leadership and management.Mr. Ballmer observes that they both took over from revered, successful leaders — Mr. Welch at G.E., and Bill Gates at Microsoft — just after the stock market had peaked and that investors have had lingering doubts about the outlook for both companies, despite solid results in most years.“Even if you’re doing a good job, it doesn’t always get reported that way,” Mr. Ballmer notes.After P.& G., Mr. Immelt went to Harvard Business School for an M.B.A. A math whiz, his favorite subject was finance. But when he graduated in 1982, he turned down a job offer from Morgan Stanley, opting for an industrial company — and the one where his father had built a career — over Wall Street. At G.E., he began climbing the ranks.Relaxed and affable, he is routinely described as “comfortable in his own skin.” In his autobiography, Mr. Welch wrote that he selected Mr. Immelt as his successor because “I felt Jeff had the perfect blend of intelligence and edge and epitomized the trait that’s so important to me — he was really comfortable in his own skin.”THE G.E. campaign to promote energy-efficient products, begun in 2005 and called ecomagination, is a model of Mr. Immelt’s efforts to push large-scale change. It began because he believed that energy efficiency and alternative energy sources were growth markets and that G.E. should capitalize on those trends.To find new ideas, Mr. Immelt spends much of his time traveling and talking to customers, industry partners, government officials and analysts.Mr. Immelt, according to Beth Comstock, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at G.E., is constantly scouting for opportunity. “He says, ‘Hey, I think there’s something here,’ ” Ms. Comstock says. “Let’s see what we can do.” When he gets excited, teams are dispatched to assess markets, products and research and technology trends, typically in a few weeks or less.

When the campaign began, some inside and outside of G.E. dismissed it as a marketing gimmick, and internal employee surveys found little enthusiasm for it. “Ecomagination had a favorability rating of like one when it started, maybe two, me and Beth,” Mr. Immelt recalls, amused. “So it was like two against 300,000 the first day.”But momentum built gradually, especially as more G.E. products delivered energy savings and market acceptance. Today, products that qualify for the ecomagination label total $20 billion in sales. One example: G.E. not only sells a hybrid locomotive, but also is building a battery plant in upstate New York that will employ 350 workers. Its production is intended for fuel-efficient locomotives and backup power supplies for data centers and telecommunications switching stations. G.E. hopes to make industrial batteries a $1 billion-a-year business.“That was totally Jeff Immelt,” says Mark Little, who oversees G.E.’s research efforts and led the locomotive effort. “The kinds of things that cut across business units — or have no natural home in a business — are not natural acts for us. And he makes sure they happen.”Occasionally, Mr. Immelt just issues an order. After a trip to Brazil in January, he became convinced that the country was rapidly advancing in technology and that G.E. should place a research lab there. When he returned to the United States, he told Mr. Little, as Mr. Immelt recalls, “Hey dude, you’re going to put a global research center in Brazil. Pick a good place.” Last month, G.E. announced it would build a research center in Rio de Janeiro.Leadership by fiat when done in moderation, Mr. Immelt says, can drive change and set a course. “I think that if you run a big company, you’ve got to four or five times a year, just say, ‘Hey team, look, here’s where we’re going,’ ” he says. “If you do it 10 times, nobody wants to work for you. If you do it zero times, you have anarchy.”Despite the financial crisis and recession, Mr. Immelt has kept investing for the long haul. Research and development spending increased last year to $3.3 billion, and will be still higher this year. “It would have been easy to say times are tough and we’ll pull back on research spending and long-range projects, but he didn’t do any of that,” says Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and a former consultant to G.E. “Jeff Immelt really held onto his technology-led-innovation agenda.”G.E.’s management traditions emphasize patience and its leaders typically have long tenures. Mr. Welch was at the helm for two decades, and Mr. Immelt, 54, has been in charge for nearly a decade. A winter or two of discontent is not cause for dismissal. But the stock price, which closed at $16.78 on Friday, is less than half its level when Mr. Immelt took over in 2001. The stock has barely budged in the last year, as G.E. slowly climbs back from the financial crisis.There is no indication of a restive board. Yet shareholders are waiting to see better days from the battered stock of G.E., long the bluest of blue chip companies. Under Mr. Immelt, the company has pared its offerings — the plastics business was sold off, the majority stake in NBC Universal is being sold to Comcast, and, of course, GE Capital has been whittled down.

THE near-term prospects for G.E.’s stock seem to depend, if not on financial engineering, then at least on financial moves that might lift the dividend back toward its pre-crisis levels. The NBC sale to Comcast could bring $8 billion in cash. And negotiating with Mr. Buffett to buy back his $3 billion in preferred stock, which pays a 10 percent dividend, could free up $300 million in yearly fees. Those steps could clear the way to raising the dividend and making the stock fetching again for investors.“That’s the fulcrum for G.E. stock until the economy strengthens and the industrial business really gets rolling again,” says Nicholas Heymann, an analyst for Sterne, Agee & Leach.Mr. Immelt observes that G.E.’s stock, which climbed above $40 in 2007 before the crisis kicked in, has mirrored how investors have viewed financial services over the last decade. That’s a perception Mr. Immelt hopes to change as he re-emphasizes G.E.’s manufacturing prowess and reins in the financial operation.“As we come out of the recession, we’re going to see if the moves to streamline the portfolio will pay off,” says Steven Winoker, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “We haven’t seen positive results yet.”For his part, Mr. Immelt is an optimist. “We’re going to be one of the companies that comes out of the crisis stronger than we went in,” he says. “I think that is something that is ultimately going to be good for employees and investors.”

General Electric, the 125-year-old industrial giant whose jet engines propel air travelers around the globe and whose electrical generators light millions of households, declared on Monday that it would be installing its first new leader in 16 years.Jeffrey R. Immelt, 61, the departing chief executive, transformed G.E. over the past decade, jettisoning most of its once-huge financial business, which seemed to threaten the company’s survival after the 2008 economic crisis. Wall Street applauded those moves, but investors grew disenchanted as the company’s stock price and profits stagnated in recent years.His successor, John Flannery, 55, is a longtime G.E. executive who has spent much of his career in finance and deal making, raising expectations among some observers that he might look to sell off pieces of the sprawling company. Mr. Flannery told analysts that he would embark on a “comprehensive review” of all G.E. businesses “with speed, urgency and no constraints.”Mr. Flannery’s tenure may well determine the shape and the economic role of conglomerates like G.E. — expansive companies with seemingly limitless business ambitions — that once defined an American industrial era. Now, G.E. is among the last of the breed. Continue reading the main story

The company’s roots reach back more than a century, to the laboratories of the storied inventor Thomas A. Edison. G.E. today sells magnetic resonance imaging machines, provides financial and data services, manufactures light bulbs and performs drug research, among myriad other activities.


            Return to Industrials        

            In 2008, almost half of General Electric’s revenue came from service businesses. After G.E. shed NBCUniversal and much of its financing arm, more than 90 percent of its revenue now comes from industrial businesses.

But as a rule, Wall Street does not like conglomerates. Instead, investors tend to prefer the clarity of companies with simpler product lines and fewer moving parts.Mr. Immelt had spoken in the past of stepping down this year. But no successor had been formally named, and in recent months, G.E.’s lagging stock performance brought increasing pressure from investors and new urgency to questions about when he might depart.

Those questions were being addressed by the G.E. board on May 13 at a trendy hotel in downtown Manhattan, a location selected in part because it was a place where people seemed unlikely to recognize G.E. board members. There, four contenders for Mr. Immelt’s post lined up and made their case to claim the top job.G.E. said its succession planning had been in the works for about five years, with a target of this summer. Activity accelerated in the past year, once the leading candidates had gathered wider experience across the company.The company’s lead independent director, Jack Brennan, said that there had been an “ongoing dialogue” about the timing but that, in the end, everything “happened to marry up with the schedule we had in place,” which Mr. Immelt had agreed to.Mr. Flannery will become chief executive on Aug. 1. Mr. Immelt will remain as chairman until he retires on Dec. 31. Mr. Flannery will then add that role on Jan. 1.Mr. Brennan has fielded calls recently from frustrated shareholders, according to two people familiar with those conversations. In an interview, Mr. Brennan — a former chief executive of Vanguard, a large mutual fund firm — said: “I talk to investors all the time. And given my background, I get a lot of unsolicited advice.”Investors’ calls for change increased noticeably two years ago when Nelson Peltz, an activist shareholder, and his investment firm, Trian, bought a $2 billion stake, making it one of G.E.’s largest shareholders. In an 80-page presentation at that time, Mr. Peltz and his team called on management to cut costs, buy back shares and further shrink G.E.’s finance business, GE Capital. Trian said its plan would sharply increase G.E.’s share price, to $40 or more by the end of 2017.G.E. has taken some of the proposed steps, and its shares had risen more than 10 percent from the beginning of Trian’s campaign through Friday. Still, rival industrial firms did far better over the same period: United Technologies shares rose 43 percent, and Honeywell’s stock was up 46 percent.









 



On Monday, G.E. closed at $28.94 a share, up 4 percent but still below Trian’s target range. Trian was not consulted on the leadership change and learned about it Monday morning when the company made its announcement.

Even investors who praise Mr. Immelt for drastically reducing G.E.’s dependence on finance and shedding its nonindustrial businesses, like the media company NBCUniversal, welcomed the change. “Frankly, it’s the right thing to do,” said Robert Atchinson, managing director of Adage Capital Management, a $30 billion fund that holds G.E. shares. “G.E. needs to go to the next level of change.”Mr. Immelt had to guide G.E. through significant shocks during his tenure. Just after he became chief executive, in 2001, the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 battered the airline industry and other buyers of its equipment.

Later, the global financial crisis of 2008 delivered a severe blow, one partly self-inflicted. For years, G.E. had chased the seemingly easy profits to be made in everything from American home mortgages to credit-card financing in Japan. In some years, that business made up as much as half the company’s income, and G.E. became one of the largest lenders in the United States.The finance buildup was begun by Jack Welch, the legendary chairman and chief executive and Mr. Immelt’s predecessor, who served for two decades and oversaw an era of tremendous global expansion. That emphasis on financial businesses continued for years under Mr. Immelt — until the 2008 crisis.Suddenly, finance and the regulatory demands that came with it became riskier and less attractive. GE Capital’s size meant that it was deemed a “systemically important financial institution” in the years that followed, the official name for a lender that the government considers too big to fail. The designation cut into potential profits by imposing additional business restrictions.Since announcing plans to sell off the bulk of that business two years ago, G.E. has sold a significant chunk, including a number of its finance operations in Europe. The “systemically important” designation was removed from GE Capital last year.In the past few years, G.E.’s profit performance has suffered because lower oil prices have hurt the company’s big oil-field-equipment business. In October, G.E. agreed to merge its oil-and-gas unit with Baker Hughes in an effort to create a stronger business that could benefit from a recovery in oil prices.A major part of Mr. Immelt’s strategy to unify G.E.’s many businesses was to invest heavily to transform it into what it has called a digital industrial company. He had said he wanted G.E. to be “a top-10 software company” by 2020. Continue reading the main story

            The Electric Men of G.E.        

            Edison Electric Light Company, the parent of G.E., was formed in 1878 to aid Thomas Edison in the development of the incandescent lamp. Here are some of G.E.’s leaders.        




 






The idea would be that, for instance, software could harness the data produced by a jet engine to predict when the engine needed maintenance, saving time and money. The technology could be used across G.E.’s businesses, whether medical equipment or wind turbines.

“It’s an open question as to whether that pays off,” said Karim Lakhani, a professor at Harvard Business School.Like Mr. Immelt, Mr. Flannery is a company veteran, having begun at GE Capital in 1987 with a focus on evaluating risk for big corporate lending deals. In 2013, he took over business development at the corporate level, and he was involved in G.E.’s sizable acquisition of Alstom’s energy businesses and the shrinking of GE Capital. Mr. Flannery joined GE Healthcare in 2014, overseeing a turnaround of that business, the company said.In an interview, Mr. Flannery took issue with the characterization of him as a financial engineer. Much of his time in finance, he said, was assessing businesses, their managements and whether to make investments. “It wasn’t trading derivatives,” he said.Mr. Flannery was one of the four candidates who made presentations to the board at the May 13 meeting at the Beekman Hotel in Manhattan. Their day started at 7:30 a.m. and lasted till 4 p.m.The other three competing for the job were Jeffrey S. Bornstein, the chief financial officer (he will become vice chairman, G.E. said Monday); Steve Bolze, the president of G.E.’s power-generation business; and Lorenzo Simonelli, the president of G.E.’s oil-and-gas unit, according to a person briefed on the meeting who was not authorized to speak publicly.Before the meeting, the board members received folders of documents detailing the history, track record and executive reviews of the candidates. One by one, each made a presentation of more than an hour and a half on the subject “the road forward for G.E.,” Mr. Brennan said.The board knew them all well. In the past few years, G.E. board members, in groups of three to five, had visited each of the executives in their businesses. One visit to Mr. Flannery was in Uppsala, Sweden, where GE Healthcare has a life sciences unit, doing biological research for new therapies.On Friday morning, the board met again to vote, this time at the Boston Harbor Hotel. The conference room had been swept for listening devices the night before, and security guards were stationed outside overnight.The vote, Mr. Brennan said, was unanimous in favor of Mr. Flannery. He got the call a bit after 1 p.m. in Chicago, the headquarters of GE Healthcare, to tell him he would be the next chief executive.

 Correction: June 12, 2017  
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when Jeffrey Immelt became chief executive of General Electric. It was before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, not after.

                In this first installment of our two-part interview, General Electric chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt explains why industrial companies are now in the information business—whether they like it or not.

Five years ago, US corporate giant General Electric had to decide how to respond to the digitization of the industrial sector: build or buy? As chairman and chief executive officer Jeff Immelt reveals in this interview with McKinsey’s Rik Kirkland, GE decided to build, and has since added thousands of staff and embraced data and analytics as the driving force transforming its operations globally. It’s a bold push driven by Immelt’s belief that the storied company, founded 123 years ago in Schenectady, New York, must shape its own future in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape. An edited transcript of his comments follows.
Interview transcript
Digitizing in the industrial space

We think about this as digitization of the industrial world. We as a company didn’t go to bed one night and say, “We can’t be an industrial company anymore. We need to be more like Oracle. We need to be more like Microsoft.” It happened more on an evolutionary basis, really based on the industries we’re in and the technology we serve.

You think about a jet engine today or a locomotive or an MRI scanner. A new jet engine might have a hundred sensors on it. These sensors have the capability to take continuous data about the heat of an engine, fuel consumption, the wear of the blades, the environment it’s taking off in—a series of things. And one flight between New York City and Chicago produces a terabyte of data.

So industrial companies are in the information business whether they want to be or not. This is going to happen in the industrial space. Now, add to that a series of decisions every company needs to make: “Do I outsource all of that? Do I do it myself? Do I change my business model accordingly?” The decision we’ve made is that we just want to be all in.

We want to treat analytics like it’s as core to the company over the next 20 years as material science has been over the past 50 years. We can hire the talent. We can evolve our business model accordingly. We need to treat our service agreements to share outcomes with our customers the same way an IT company might approach that in the future. So, in order to do that, we have to add technology, we have to add people, we have to change our business models. We have to be willing to do all those things.

But the point I’d make to people is, if you think about today, 15 percent or 20 percent of the S&P 500 valuation is consumer Internet stocks that didn’t exist 15 or 20 years ago. The consumer companies got none of that. When you look at retailers, banks, consumer-product companies, they got none of that. If you look out 10 or 15 years and say that same value is going to be created in the industrial Internet, do you as an industrial company want to sit there and say, “I don’t want any of that. I’m going to let a Newco or some other company get all that”? Is that really what you’ve relegated yourself to?

So I think all these things led us to say, “Let’s build it. Let’s see if we can be good at it. We may be wrong. We don’t think so, but we may be wrong. But let’s not sit back and just say, ‘Look, that’s somebody else’s job,’ or ‘We’re not good enough to do it,’ or ‘We can’t change.’” We’re unwilling to take that as a fait accompli.
Building versus buying

We went through a process of “make versus buy,” “in versus out.” We basically said, “Look, do we want to make a big acquisition in analytics or IT?” And we analyzed a bunch of different cases and said, “We don’t have the foundation inside the company to do a big acquisition. Do we want to partner, or do we want to do it ourselves?” We have lots of good software partners, but, basically, we said, “We need to do this ourselves. Let’s err on the side of seeing if we could approach it in that way.” That was 2010. So we brought people in from the outside. We built a center in California. We started populating our businesses. Roll forward, we started doing applications with customers. We started building it into our service business, things like that.

I could give you a bunch of different analogies, but in the case of our locomotive customers, they have a phrase  called “velocity.” Every CEO of a railroad could tell you their velocity. The velocity tends to be, let’s say, between 20 and 25 miles per hour. This tends to be the average miles per hour that a locomotive travels in a day—22. Doesn’t seem very good. And the difference between 23 and 22 for, let’s say, Norfolk Southern, is worth $250 million in annual profit. That’s huge for a company like that. That’s one mile [per hour]. So that’s all about scheduling better. It’s all about less downtime. It’s all about not having broken wheels, being able to get through Chicago faster. That’s all analytics.
Being a platform company and an app company

Inside in the company, we’re about $5 billion in revenue—this is from software, analytical applications, things like that. We’ve built up a population of applications; we’re approaching $500 million of productivity a year. Now what we’re trying to do is push that back inside the company. We’re selling it, but we want to get our own internal company on the same basis, on the same platform, using the same skills—what we call the “digital thread.” We want the digital thread to go from engineering all the way through our installed base.

We’ve made the decision that we’re going to try to be both a platform company and an application company. So we have a platform called Predix, and we’re building applications on top of that. We’re probably the only industrial company that’s actually trying to do its own. And we’re opening up our platform to our customers. We’re saying to our customers, “Look, if you want to write apps, applications on Predix, you’re free to do it.”

I always think risk first, like most CEOs. I basically say to investors, “Look, if all we did is we got more productivity, higher service sales, applications, you guys are going to love this. If we end up having the platform that works, it’s a whole new company, you know? So you get that for free.”

But that’s why I circle back and would say to any CEO, industrial or nonindustrial, that where we are right now is going to be the most important thing that you’re going to work on, at least in this era. And you give up your latitude at your own peril.
Hiring the right people

We have probably hired, since we started this, a couple thousand data scientists and people like that. That’s going to continue to grow and multiply. What we’ve found is we’ve got to hire new product managers, different kinds of commercial people. It’s going to be in the thousands.

So what you’re going to do is you’re going to blend them with the GE team, and then we’re going to recruit differently. When we go to college campuses, we’re going to look for different skills. We’re going to put them in different training programs. It’s a combination of we’ve got to bring our culture along, but that’s not enough. We’ve got to bring thousands of people in from the outside. That’s the only way we’re going to get there fast enough.

This is something I got wrong. I thought it was all about technology. I thought if we hired a couple thousand technology people, if we upgraded our software, things like that, that was it. I was wrong. Product managers have to be different; salespeople have to be different; on-site support has to be different. We’ve had to drill and change a lot about the company. And I just think it’s infecting everything we do. It’s infecting our own IT. It’s infecting our own manufacturing plants. It’s infected everything we’re doing, I think in a positive way.
Changing company culture

When you think about internal change—culture, people, leadership development—again, here’s a time where multiple things happened at the same time. We started our digital initiative maybe five or six years ago. We’ve also, as a company—and I don’t think GE’s unique—lived through the financial crisis. And we’re an old company. We live in highly regulated industries. What we found was our culture was too complicated to get the work done the way we needed to get our work done, both in terms of how we were trying to digitize and how we were trying to survive in terms of a more highly regulated world. And just think about our footprint and the complexity of running a global operation: even since I was CEO, GE has gone from 70 percent inside the United States to 70 percent outside the United States.

So what we’ve tried to do inside the company is really just drive what we call a “culture of simplification”: fewer layers, fewer processes, fewer decision points. We’ve adapted the lean tools in what I would call a Silicon Valley approach, what we call “Fast Works.” We’ve embraced some of the Silicon Valley tools in terms of putting everything on the clock, bringing commercial intensity into the company. The way I describe that is, like most big companies, we’re willing to take all kinds of market risk so that we don’t have to take internal risk, right? We try to say, “Look, let’s actually be aggressive in the markets, and let’s count on our own execution to risk reduce inside the company.” And broadly, getting to digitization, we’re democratizing information inside the company; getting IT tools that were contemporary in a mobile setting, and we call these things the culture of simplification.

My notion is we’re in a permanently complex world. And this historical organization chart with lots of processes is a thing of the past. We’ve basically unplugged anything that was annual. The notion is that, in the digital age, sitting down once a year to do anything is weird, it’s just bizarre. So whether it’s doing business reviews or strategic planning, it’s in a much more continuous way. We still give a lot of feedback. We still do a lot of analysis of how you’re performing. But we make it much more contemporary and much more 360-degree. So somebody can get interactions with their boss on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis. And the data you get is being collected by your peers, the people who work for you, in a much more accurate and fluid way.

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]
Immelt served as commencement speaker at Michigan State University's 2 pm ceremony on December 11, 2010, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of business.[76] He was the commencement speaker on May 23, 2010, at Hamilton College, which awarded him its honorary Doctor of Laws,[77] and on May 24, 2010, at Boston College, where he was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Business Administration.[78] He addressed the undergraduate class of 2011 of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on May 23, 2011, and received an honorary Doctor of Public Service [79] degree despite controversy at the school[80] over GE's corporate tax strategies.[81] In May 2013, he delivered the commencement address at the University of Connecticut Graduate School,[82] and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[83] In 2015 he delivered the commencement address at Siena College[84] where he was also awarded the honorary Doctor of Humanities.[85]
In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science. Clemson awarded Immelt with an honorary doctorate and Immelt spoke of how GE hired many Clemson alumni at their gas turbine factory in Greenville, South Carolina.

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]

Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]

In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science.

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]
Commencement addresses[edit]
He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]
Immelt served as commencement speaker at Michigan State University's 2 pm ceremony on December 11, 2010, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of business.[76] He was the commencement speaker on May 23, 2010, at Hamilton College, which awarded him its honorary Doctor of Laws,[77] and on May 24, 2010, at Boston College, where he was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Business Administration.[78] He addressed the undergraduate class of 2011 of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on May 23, 2011, and received an honorary Doctor of Public Service [79] degree despite controversy at the school[80] over GE's corporate tax strategies.[81] In May 2013, he delivered the commencement address at the University of Connecticut Graduate School,[82] and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[83] In 2015 he delivered the commencement address at Siena College[84] where he was also awarded the honorary Doctor of Humanities.[85]
In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science. Clemson awarded Immelt with an honorary doctorate and Immelt spoke of how GE hired many Clemson alumni at their gas turbine factory in Greenville, South Carolina.

Early life[edit]
Immelt was born in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division ("GEAE" is now known as GE Aviation).[2][3]
Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle.[4] He earned an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Economics cum laude [5] from Dartmouth College graduating with the class of 1978; he was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and currently serves on the Dartmouth board of trustees[6][7].
During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter and Gamble before matriculating at Harvard for his MBA.[8]
Immelt earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1982. He described business school as "one of the most intense times of your life." [9]
Career[edit]
General Electric[edit]
Background[edit]
Immelt has been with GE since 1982, when he graduated from Harvard with his MBA. He held a number of increasingly senior positions in GE's plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took on the leadership of GE Healthcare before being named CEO.[10]
The competition for the CEO position that Immelt won began when Jack Welch asked Gary Wendt, the head of GE Financial Services, Inc, then a $41 billion empire and GE's most profitable division, to resign, on the theory that he would overshadow Welch's other candidates.[11] Immelt surpassed Robert Nardelli, who was so close to Welch that his nickname was "Little Jack", and James McNerney; Nardelli would leave GE to head Home Depot and then Chrysler, and McNerney left GE to lead 3M (before going on to lead Boeing). Immelt was selected by the GE Board in November, 2000, to succeed Welch as CEO of GE; he served as GE's President and Chairman-elect for ten months before taking the position of Chairman and CEO of GE on September 7, 2001.[5] He will retire from GE on December 31, 2017.
Crisis management[edit]
Immelt has been thrust into three significant external crises since taking the lead at GE as Chairman on September 7, 2001. Almost immediately he faced the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He then was pressed to defend GE's business model and the quality of its financial reports as the economy reeled from the Enron crisis. In 2008-09 he shepherded GE through the United States financial crisis.
His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note – he took over the role on September 7, 2001,[12] just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector.
Immelt defended GE's reporting elections and the quality of its financial statements following heightened scrutiny after the Enron crisis. In 2001, his first year end as CEO, Immelt famously offered the market and the SEC a choice in financial reports, a new dramatically expanded set of reports with more details,[13] versus what had been the traditional format for GE's SEC filings. The experiment seemed to confirm that the traditional format, which was shorter, was preferable and it continues to be used at GE today. Immelt's intuition and judgments about financial reporting transparency were validated in experiments in behavioral economics conducted at Princeton in 2004.[14] Immelt has led GE through two reporting challenges since then: it has been required to restate its SEC filings;[15] and, in 2009 GE agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud.[16]
GE could not escape the 2008 crisis that was fueled by the mortgage-backed securities debacle on Wall Street and the liquidity crisis that brought the derivatives market to its knees. GE's major financial business is known as GE Capital and it is operated largely through the General Electric Credit Corporation subsidiary. As part of its response to the credit crisis, GE joined Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in forming a wholly owned banking affiliate that qualified as a Savings and Loan Association. This entitles the subsidiary to FDIC insurance over its deposit at the cost of bowing to regulation as a bank holding company. Aid received from the Federal Reserve by GE has also become a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.[17]
Strategy[edit]
Immelt has not been a passive inheritor of "the house that Jack built." [18] In fact at the outset of this time as GE's CEO, Immelt took pains to establish that he would act as "his own man." [19]
Welch preferred internal, or "organic" growth and benefited from long-term US economic trends that buoyed his major business lines. In particular Welch's tenure benefited from the economic expansion during the Clinton Administration which ended immediately before Immelt became GE's CEO. The US economy has faced a number of shocks since Immelt became CEO: the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the recessionary quarters under the Obama Administration.
Immelt's governance has taken a different path, differentiating him from Welch in both substance and style. On the one hand he has eliminated or reduced GE's involvement in a number of businesses from the Welch era, with moves in the Plastics, Appliance and GE Capital businesses. On the other hand, he has seized the growing international nature of commerce to expand GE's operations overseas.
Divestitures[edit]
The GE plastics business was sold in 2007 for $11.6 billion to Saudi Arabian interests.[20] Welch had been the leader of GE's plastics business before being named its overall CEO. In 2014 GE agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion [21] In 2013[22] Immelt completed the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast for $8 billion.[23]
In April 2015, GE announced a major series of reorganization steps. It plans to sell its real estate business for $26.5 billion, sell most of its GE Capital assets which now total $500 billion, and repatriate nearly $36 billion in cash held overseas to fund while the Board also authorized a share buyback program using up to $50 billion.[24] This plan confirms GE's intent to exit the banking business.[25]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Immelt's reorganization of GE has been accomplished in part through a number of acquisitions. He underscored the riskiness of an acquisition-based growth strategy in 2011 when he said, "You can't do a lot of deals, and have them all be great." [23] Geographically his strategy has focused on two areas: China and Europe.
GE's efforts in China have been central to Immelt's vision. In July 2011 Immelt's General Electric announced that it is in the process of relocating its X-ray division from Wisconsin to China.[26][27] Immelt had previously referred to China as GE's "second home market".[26]
Immelt initiated one of his first major acquisitions in his area of operating expertise, the medical business. In 2004 GE bought UK based Amerhsam PLC for $9.5 billion.[28] GE is currently attempting to complete its acquisition of Alstom, France businesses for an enterprise value of $13.5 billion [29]
At the same time, Immelt has taken a number of actions that have been controversial, with some leading to bad publicity. A major headline grabber has been the reduction in GE's workforce at the same time that Immelt served on a Presidential Council whose aim was to increase US employment (see Public Service section).
Performance[edit]
On March 3, 2002, according to its fiscal 2001 SEC Form 10K GE had 9,935,629,691 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value $396.1 billion on March 2, 2002. On January 31, 2015, according to its fiscal 2004 SEC Form 10K, GE had 10,064,909,484 shares of voting common stock outstanding with an aggregate market value of at least $261.1 billion on "the last business day of [Ge's] most recently completed second fiscal quarter."
Since taking over, GE's stock price has dropped 3% while income has risen from $15.1 billion in 2002 to $16.9 billion in 2013.[30][31][32] At the ten year mark of Immelt's tenure at GE, its stock price had dropped 61% from its levels when he took over; during that same 10-year period GE has paid out $87 billion in dividends.[23] The S&P 500 Index has roughly doubled in value since Immelt took over.
Employment[edit]
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE's SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.
General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Immelt has been associated in the press with a number of public controversies.
He is working with the NFL to find a constructive medical solution to the head-trauma injury issues faced by football players of all types.
Immelt's role concerning employment and unemployment is his greatest controversy. He served on a Presidential Council whose goal included increasing employment in the US while leading GE during more than a decade of volatility in the number of people it employs. Those believing his business roles contributed to unemployment have demonstrated at his college speeches. The number of people employed by GE has been volatile as a performance statistic, both rising and falling; that volatility reflects both GE cost cutting efforts under GE and the acquisition and sale of several large businesses, each with their own significant number of employees.
Immelt's strategies have contributed to a build-up of cash. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax.[34] As such, GE is a member of a controversial group of American companies experiencing "trapped cash" thought to exceed $1.7 trillion across this group of corporations. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances.
After the US fiscal crisis of 2008–09, Immelt reduced GE's dividends to conserve capital and internal funding, causing a negative reaction among some dividend-oriented investors. He recently began a public campaign to press the state of Connecticut for local tax benefits and threatened to move some of GE's operations out of the state if the benefits were not forthcoming.
As Chairman and CEO of GE, Immelt has come under attack for leading GE towards legally avoiding paying US federal corporate taxes. GE's tax positions have become a major item in Immelt's agenda. GE's local taxes in Connecticut have increased 5 times since 2011, and the state had approved yet another revised tax policy in early 2015. Immelt threatened to move GE"s headquarters out of Connecticut if the state would not back away from the tax plan.[35]
During the US Presidential elections in 2012, GE came under attack for not paying US federal taxes while receiving substantial federal tax benefits. While the tax attacks created the impression that GE paid no taxes, its worldwide tax expense was over $3 billion, with most of the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. GE is reported to have paid no federal US taxes in 2010.[36]
Compensation and retirement[edit]
Immelt's compensation has fluctuated significantly. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt earned a total compensation of $14,209,267.[37] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $5,717,469.[38] In 2009, Immelt earned a total compensation of $5,487,155.[37] In 2010, Immelt's compensation nearly doubled to $15.2 million.[39] Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus.[40]In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million,[41] a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million.[42] That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.[43]
On June 12, 2017, GE announced that is chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt would retire, to be replaced by John L. Flannery.[44]
Philanthropy[edit]
Charitable activities[edit]
Immelt serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.[45] He has also served on the board of Catalyst, a not for profit organization dedicated to advancing women in business.[46]
He was elected a Charter Trustee of his alma mater, Dartmouth, in 2008 and as of 2015 continues in that role. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.[47][48]
Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career, from his experiences as a former player. As GE CEO, he has taken a leadership position in finding solutions to the risk of head trauma injuries among NFL players. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE's participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.[49]
He has personally participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in which celebrities are videoed pouring buckets of ice water over themselves and the videos are then posted online to help raise charitable funds for the ALS Association.[50]
The GE Foundation has been extolled as a leader in corporate charitable giving since Immelt became GE CEO, with special attention to its efforts to support schools in the US, over and above its university activities, and healthcare in poor countries.[51] Under Immelt, GE frequently appears in lists of notably charitable US corporations; for example, GE was pictured No. 8 in 2008 with charitable disbursements of $161.5 million in a ranking published by Forbes.[52]
Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.[53]
Public service[edit]
Immelt served as Chairman of The Business Council, a nonpartisan organization, in 2005 and 2006.[54] It is notable that two GE CEOs, Reginald Jones and Jack Welch, each also served in this capacity.
Immelt was named a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2006.[46] He resigned the board position in 2011.[55]
As one of America's top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying "If you're serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it's the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world." [56]
In February 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, Immelt was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the president and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[57] When President Obama chose to put Jeffrey Immelt at the head of the Economic Advisory Board, he felt that Immelt had attributions in knowing what would help the global economy. Obama has reported that Immelt has emerged as one of his top economic advisors in regards to trying to rebuild America's economy.[58]
On January 21, 2011, President Obama announced Immelt's appointment as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers, succeeding former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.[59] The New York Times reported that Obama's appointment of Immelt was "another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly."[59] The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012.[60] In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down.[61]
Honors[edit]
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth cum laude and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[47]
Career honors[edit]
Barron's has named Immelt one of the "World's Best CEOs" three times. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[62][63] The Financial Times named him "Man of the Year" in 2003.[46] Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.[64]
Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others.[65] In accepting the award, he said "I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. "What I learned playing football enters my life every day." [66]
In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize "as a foreigner who reinforced his country's cultural and economic ties with Italy." [67]
On 24 December 2015, Immelt was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[68]

He has been awarded approximately ten Honorary Doctorates and has given more than this number of university speeches including Commencement Addresses.
After becoming chairman of GE, Immelt delivered his first university address to the 2001 graduating class of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, of which he is an alumnus, as their Investiture Speaker.[5] He gave the college commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth, in June 2004.[69]
On February 26, 2002, shortly after becoming GE's Chairman and CEO, Immelt gave a Town Hall speech at Georgia Institute of Technology as a guest of their President.[70] In the years that followed, Immelt gave the commencement address at Northeastern University (2006) and received the honorary Doctorate of Business Administration.[71] He returned to Georgia Tech in the spring of 2007 as their commencement speaker.[72] He was commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on May 20, 2007, where he was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws.[73] He was commencement speaker at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute on May 17, 2008[74] and received an honorary degree.[75]

In 2016, Immelt spoke at the commencement for Clemson University's College of Arts, Architecture, and Humanities as well as the College of Engineering and Science.

Profession: Chief Executive Officer
Date of Birth: Feb 19, 1956
Nicknames: Jeffrey Immelt
Country: United States of AmericaWhat is Jeffrey Immelt's net worth?  Jeffrey Immelt's net worth is $60 million dollars and annual salary of $22 million.  Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Jeffrey Immelt graduated from Darthmouth College with an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and from Harvard University Business School.  He became the CEO of General Electric in 2001, just days before the September 11th attacks.  His leadership of GE has been widely criticized for cutting American jobs and paying little to no corporate income taxes. Immelt is on the board of the non-profit Robin Hood Foundation, an organization dedicated to addressing issues of poverty in New York City.  In 2008, he was selected for inclusion in Time Magazine's list of the Most Influential People in the World.  In 2009, he joined the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and in 2011 he became Chairperson of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a White House panel of external economic advisors tasked with boosting the job market in the United States. Jeffrey Robert "Jeff" Immelt (born February 19, 1956) is an American business executive. He is currently the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the U.S.-based conglomerate General Electric. He was selected by GE's Board of Directors in 2000 to replace Jack Welch following his retirement. Previously, Immelt had headed up GE's Medical Systems division (now known as GE Healthcare) as its President and CEO.Immelt was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Donna Rosemary (n'ee Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division. Immelt attended Finneytown High School; he played football in college and was an offensive tackle. He holds an B.A. in Applied Mathematics from Dartmouth College where he currently serves on the board of trustees and was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha, and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. He has been with GE since 1982 and is on the board of two non-profit organizations, one of which is the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.His tenure as chairman and CEO started off on a low note - he took over the role on September 7, 2001, just four days before the terrorist attacks on the United States, which killed two employees and cost GE's insurance business $600 million, as well as having a direct effect on the company's Aircraft Engines sector. Jeffrey Immelt has been CEO of General Electric for 10 years and with the company for 29 years, where he finds himself as number 145 on Forbes' CEO Compensation list. He has a total five year compensation of $53.82 million, ranking him 6th place among the Conglomerates.  Immelt was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. He was also named one of the five worst Non-Financial-Crisis-Related CEOs of 2008 by the Free Enterprise Action Fund. Since taking over, GE's stock has dropped nearly 60%.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Leadership is an intense journey into yourself. You can use your own style to get anything done. It's about being self-aware. Every morning, I look in the mirror and say, 'I could have done three things better yesterday.'
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Leadership,
Morning,
Journey



















I have learned that nothing is certain except for the need to have strong risk management, a lot of cash, the willingness to invest even when the future is unclear, and great people.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Future,
Great,
Strong
























I think that if you run a big company, you've got to, four or five times a year, just say, 'Hey team, look, here's where we're going.' If you do it 10 times, nobody wants to work for you. If you do it zero times, you have anarchy.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Work,
Team,
Look



















Enron and 9/11 marked the end of an era of individual freedom and the beginning of personal responsibility.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Freedom,
Beginning,
End



















The one thing that people don't get about GE is that, to the people who work here, it's not a company. It's not just a job. You feel like you're part of a 120-year-old ever-growing, ever-improving family.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Work,
Family,
Job



















September 11 was horrific, but I've been through enough crises before that I had my own pattern as to how to collect facts, what a leader should do, how to communicate with people, how to set up operating mechanisms to work our way through it.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Work,
Leader,
People



















I'd be lying if I didn't say there were days when I went back and said, 'I wish I'd done this. I should have done that. I handled this the wrong way.' But it's always in the motivation of getting better. I've never once looked in the mirror and said, 'Oh boy, can't do this one.'
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Mirror,
Motivation,
Wish



















I love working with customers. Sales has really influenced everything I do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense of urgency and listening to people.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Love,
Listening,
Sales



















Many bought into the idea that America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption-based economy - and somehow still expect to prosper. That idea was flat wrong. Our economy tilted instead toward the quicker profits of financial services.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Financial,
America,
Economy
























Is France a completely open market to G.E.? No, of course not. I think we're more discerning about China because it's China, and they're big, and they're more concerning. But the best global companies are ones that are nuanced.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Best,
Think,
More



















I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and my parents are really right wingers. My dad watches, like, five or six hours of 'Fox News' every day and stuff like that.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Dad,
Parents,
Day



















I think we should have basically the same tax policy that Germany, Japan, the U.K., everybody else has, which is a tax rate in the mid-20s and no loopholes. Zero. The U.S. has the most antiquated tax system. And that means some people are going to pay more taxes, and some people are going to pay less.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


People,
Think,
Some People



















I do business in 170 countries; none of them is perfect. There is not even one country that I think of, and I am like, 'God, that did everything that I wanted it to do.'
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Business,
God,
I Am



















When I was a young guy, when I first started with G.E., Jack Welch sent us all to Japan because in those days Japan was gonna crush us. And we learned a lot about Japan when we were there. But over the subsequent 30 years, the Japanese companies all fell behind. And the reason why they fell behind is because they didn't globalize.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Young,
Why,
Over



















Every leader needs to clearly explain the top three things the organization is working on. If you can't, then you're not leading well.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Leader,
Organization,
You
























There is no real magic to being a good leader. But at the end of every week, you have to spend your time around the things that are really important: setting priorities, measuring outcomes, and rewarding them.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Time,
Good,
Week



















When you take over a company like GE, you think you're going to visit 100 businesses. You're going to go see the factories you haven't seen before. You're going to see a site in Texas and one in Canada and stuff like that. That has fallen by the wayside.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Think,
You,
Canada



















President Obama has asked me to chair his new President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Me,
New,
Chair



















Business leaders should provide expertise in service of our country. My predecessors at GE have done so, as have leaders of many other great American companies.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Business,
Great,
Service



















As one of America's largest exporters, GE remains committed to producing more products in the United States, which is our home and largest market.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Home,
America,
More



















GE sells more than 96 percent of its products to the private sector, where America's future must be built. But government can help business invest in our shared future.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Business,
Future,
Government



















You can stay too long in a job, that's for sure. But by the same token, in the 12 years I have been CEO of GE, there have been four CEOs of Toshiba. So there's too short a time to do it, and there's too long a time to do it.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Time,
Job,
Short
























I'm a complete globalist. I think like a global CEO. But I'm an American. I run an American company. But in order for GE to be successful in the coming years, I've gotta sell my products in every corner of the world.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


World,
American,
Successful



















I think this notion that it's the population of the U.S. against the big companies is just wrong.
Jeffrey R. Immelt


Population,
Think,
Wrong
