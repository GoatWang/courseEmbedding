        Here's How Analog Devices, Inc. Makes Its Money

Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI), according to its most recent form 10-K filing, sells a "broad line of high-performance ICs [integrated circuits] that incorporate analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing technologies.""Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications," the company explains in its 10-K filing. "We sell our ICs to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, many of whom use products spanning our core technologies in a wide range of applications."Image source: Analog Devices.
Before investing in a company's stock, it's helpful to know from what market segments a company derives its revenue and roughly how much of its overall revenue comes from each segment. That way, investors can watch broader industry trends and have some idea of how those trends will affect a company.Let's go over the four major end markets Analog Devices services.Largest market segmentAnalog Devices' largest market segment by revenue during its fiscal 2016 was the industrial market, making up 44% of its revenue during that year. In its form 10-K, Analog Devices goes over the major sub-segments within industrial.The first sub-segment is "industrial and automation," which the company says includes applications such as robotics, weigh scales, oscilloscopes, environmental control systems, and more.The next one is "defense/aerospace." Analog Devices says that, within this end market, its chips are used in applications such as navigation, radar, security, and even space and satellite communications.The third is "energy management," which the company says can include chips used in utility meters, wind turbines, and more. And, finally, there's healthcare. Within this sub-segment, Analog Devices says it provides chips for things such as CT scanners, X-ray machines, blood analyzers, ultrasounds, and more. So it's clear why this segment is Analog Devices' largest: It seems to be the company's broadest.This segment has grown modestly since 2014, with revenue rising from $1.344 billion that year to $1.502 billion in fiscal 2016. However, in 2014, this segment made up 47% of the company's overall revenue, so it's become a slightly smaller part of the company's revenue over the past few years.Communications is secondAnalog Devices' second-largest business segment, by a small margin, is communications."Communications technology involves the processing of signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and receiving data," Analog Devices explains.The company then notes that the "need for higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable bandwidth-efficient communications, creates demand for Analog Devices' products. Those products, Analog Devices says, "are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for internet protocol, video streaming, voice communication, and machine-type communications."
The company says its revenue from the communications segment was about $667 million in its fiscal 2014, making up 23% of its revenue at the time. During fiscal 2016, this segment generated a bit more than $690 million in revenue and made up 20% of the company's overall revenue.So, as is the case with the industrial segment, Analog Devices' revenue here has grown since fiscal year 2014, but it has become a smaller part of the company's overall business.Consumer is third, but growing like crazyAnalog Devices' third largest business segment is its "consumer" segment. The company doesn't go into a lot of detail about the products it builds here, but it says chips in its consumer segment go into "portable devices (smartphones, tablets and wearable devices) for media and vital signs-monitoring applications," as well as "prosumer audio/video equipment."During the company's fiscal 2014, the consumer segment generated almost $328 million in revenue, accounting for 11% of the company's business. However, this business popped during Analog Devices' fiscal 2015, with revenue more than doubling to nearly $730 million.
The business was a little down from fiscal 2015 levels in fiscal 2016, generating a bit more than $688 million, though it was still up substantially from fiscal 2014 levels. This surge is believed to have been driven by Analog Devices' supplying a key 3-D Touch component for the iPhone 6s-series smartphones, as well as the subsequent iPhone 7-series smartphones.Should Analog Devices retain its position in the upcoming iPhone models, its consumer business should easily ascend to become its second-largest business by revenue. Automotive is lastThe final segment Analog Devices serves is the automotive industry. Although a recent surge in interest in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has been a boon for some chipmakers that have traditionally had little to no content in cars, Analog Devices' automotive business doesn't seem particularly exciting, probably because it has supplied products into this market for quite some time. In fiscal 2014, Analog Devices' automotive business, which the company says involves selling a "broad portfolio of analog, digital, and MEMS" integrated circuits, generated about $525 million in revenue.In fiscal 2016, the business generated almost $541 million in sales, making up just 16% of the company's total revenue. That was down from 18% in fiscal 2014, but up from 15% in fiscal 2015, which was a flat year for the business.10 stocks we like better than Analog DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        Here's How Analog Devices, Inc. Makes Its Money

Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI), according to its most recent form 10-K filing, sells a "broad line of high-performance ICs [integrated circuits] that incorporate analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing technologies.""Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications," the company explains in its 10-K filing. "We sell our ICs to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, many of whom use products spanning our core technologies in a wide range of applications."Image source: Analog Devices.
Before investing in a company's stock, it's helpful to know from what market segments a company derives its revenue and roughly how much of its overall revenue comes from each segment. That way, investors can watch broader industry trends and have some idea of how those trends will affect a company.Let's go over the four major end markets Analog Devices services.Largest market segmentAnalog Devices' largest market segment by revenue during its fiscal 2016 was the industrial market, making up 44% of its revenue during that year. In its form 10-K, Analog Devices goes over the major sub-segments within industrial.The first sub-segment is "industrial and automation," which the company says includes applications such as robotics, weigh scales, oscilloscopes, environmental control systems, and more.The next one is "defense/aerospace." Analog Devices says that, within this end market, its chips are used in applications such as navigation, radar, security, and even space and satellite communications.The third is "energy management," which the company says can include chips used in utility meters, wind turbines, and more. And, finally, there's healthcare. Within this sub-segment, Analog Devices says it provides chips for things such as CT scanners, X-ray machines, blood analyzers, ultrasounds, and more. So it's clear why this segment is Analog Devices' largest: It seems to be the company's broadest.This segment has grown modestly since 2014, with revenue rising from $1.344 billion that year to $1.502 billion in fiscal 2016. However, in 2014, this segment made up 47% of the company's overall revenue, so it's become a slightly smaller part of the company's revenue over the past few years.Communications is secondAnalog Devices' second-largest business segment, by a small margin, is communications."Communications technology involves the processing of signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and receiving data," Analog Devices explains.The company then notes that the "need for higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable bandwidth-efficient communications, creates demand for Analog Devices' products. Those products, Analog Devices says, "are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for internet protocol, video streaming, voice communication, and machine-type communications."
The company says its revenue from the communications segment was about $667 million in its fiscal 2014, making up 23% of its revenue at the time. During fiscal 2016, this segment generated a bit more than $690 million in revenue and made up 20% of the company's overall revenue.So, as is the case with the industrial segment, Analog Devices' revenue here has grown since fiscal year 2014, but it has become a smaller part of the company's overall business.Consumer is third, but growing like crazyAnalog Devices' third largest business segment is its "consumer" segment. The company doesn't go into a lot of detail about the products it builds here, but it says chips in its consumer segment go into "portable devices (smartphones, tablets and wearable devices) for media and vital signs-monitoring applications," as well as "prosumer audio/video equipment."During the company's fiscal 2014, the consumer segment generated almost $328 million in revenue, accounting for 11% of the company's business. However, this business popped during Analog Devices' fiscal 2015, with revenue more than doubling to nearly $730 million.
The business was a little down from fiscal 2015 levels in fiscal 2016, generating a bit more than $688 million, though it was still up substantially from fiscal 2014 levels. This surge is believed to have been driven by Analog Devices' supplying a key 3-D Touch component for the iPhone 6s-series smartphones, as well as the subsequent iPhone 7-series smartphones.Should Analog Devices retain its position in the upcoming iPhone models, its consumer business should easily ascend to become its second-largest business by revenue. Automotive is lastThe final segment Analog Devices serves is the automotive industry. Although a recent surge in interest in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has been a boon for some chipmakers that have traditionally had little to no content in cars, Analog Devices' automotive business doesn't seem particularly exciting, probably because it has supplied products into this market for quite some time. In fiscal 2014, Analog Devices' automotive business, which the company says involves selling a "broad portfolio of analog, digital, and MEMS" integrated circuits, generated about $525 million in revenue.In fiscal 2016, the business generated almost $541 million in sales, making up just 16% of the company's total revenue. That was down from 18% in fiscal 2014, but up from 15% in fiscal 2015, which was a flat year for the business.10 stocks we like better than Analog DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

History[edit]
The company was founded by two MIT graduates, Ray Stata and Matthew Lorber in 1965.[9] The same year, the company released its first product, the model 101 op amp,[10] which was a hockey-puck sized module used in test and measurement equipment.[11] In 1967, the company published the first issue of its technical magazine, Analog Dialogue.[12]
In 1969, Analog Devices filed an initial public offering[13] and became a publicly traded company. Ten years later, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[14]
In 1973, the company was the first to launch laser trim wafers and the first CMOS digital-to-analog converter.[10] By 1996, the company reported over $1 billion in company revenue.[15] That same year, Jerald Fishman was named President and CEO, a position he held until his death in 2013 (see below).[16][17]
In 2000, ADI's sales grew by over 75% to $2.578 Billion and the company acquired five companies including BCO Technologies PLC, a manufacturer of thick film semiconductors, for $150 million.[15][18]
In January 2008, ON Semiconductor completed the acquisition of the CPU Voltage and PC Thermal Monitoring Business from ADI., for $184 million.
By 2004, ADI had a customer base of 60,000 and its portfolio included over 10,000 products.[15]
In July 2016, Analog and Linear Technology agreed that Analog would acquire Linear in an approximately $14.8 billion cash and stock deal.[19][20]
Locations[edit]
Analog Devices is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts, with regional headquarters located in Shanghai, China; Munich, Germany; Limerick, Ireland; and Tokyo, Japan. [21]
Analog Devices has fabrication plants located in the United States and in Ireland. The company's testing facility is located in the Philippines. Design centers are located in Australia, Canada, China, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Scotland, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey.[21]

Products and technologies[edit]
Analog Devices products include analog signal processing and digital signal processing technologies.[40] These technologies include data converters, amplifiers, radio frequency (RF) technologies, embedded processors or digital signal processing (DSP) ICs, power management, and interface products.[40]
Data converters include analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs)[40] that convert electrical signal representations of real-world analog phenomena, such as light, sound, waveforms, temperature, motion, and pressure into digital signals or data, and back again.[41] Analog Devices ADC and DAC ICs are used in medical systems, scientific instrumentation, wireless and wired communications, radar, industrial process control, audio and video equipment, and other digital-processing-based systems, where an accurate signal conversion is critical. Data converters account for more than 50% of ADI's revenue.[42] ADI's companion amplifier ICs provide accurate, high-speed and precise signals for driving data converters and are key for applications such as digital audio, current sensing, and precision instrumentation.[43]
The company's data converter chips are used by National Instruments in high-precision measurement instrumentation systems.[44] Its data converters and amplifiers are also used by scientists and researchers in project "IceCube" – an underground telescope that uses digital optical modules (DOMS) to detect subatomic particles in the South Pole.[45][46]
Power management products for customers in the industrial, wireless infrastructure, and digital camera markets. These products support signal chain design requirements, such as dynamic range, transient performance, and reliability.[47]
Interface products include a broad range of interface IC products offered by the company in product categories such as CAN (controller area network),[48] digital isolators,[49] level translators, LVDS, mobile I/O expander and keyboard Controller, USB, and RS-232[50]
Amplifiers includes precision and operational amplifiers,[51] instrumentation,[52][53] current sense, differential amplifiers,[54][55] audio amplifiers, video amplifiers/buffers/filters, variable gain amplifiers, comparators, voltage, other specialty amplifiers and products for special linear functions.
Analog Devices radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs)[56][57] address the RF signal chain and simplify RF system development.[58] The company's RF portfolio includes TruPwr(tm)[59] RMS power detectors and logarithmic amplifiers; PLL and DDS synthesizers; RF prescalers; variable gain amplifiers;[60][61][62] ADC drivers, gain blocks, LNAs and other RF amplifiers.[63]
Processors and DSP are programmable signal processing integrated circuits that execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time data. Analog Devices Processors and DSPs are the Blackfin,[64] SHARC,[65] SigmaDSP,[66] TigerSHARC, ADSP-21xx and Precision Analog Microcontrollers. These make up the company's embedded processing and DSP portfolio, that are multi-DSP signal processing,[67]
Historical[edit]
Analog Devices had a line of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones until it sold that business to InvenSense in 2013.[68] Analog Devices MEMS microphones were found in smart phones, tablet PCs, security systems, and medical applications.[69][70] ADI's MEMS accelerometers were designed into game pad controllers by Microsoft, Logitech and Pellican.[71]
Markets[edit]
Healthcare[edit]
Analog Devices sells linear, mixed-signal, MEMS and digital signal processing technologies for medical imaging, patient monitoring, medical instrumentation and home healthcare.[72] The company's precision signal-processing components and Blackfin digital signal processors are included in Karmelsonix's Wholter, an overnight pulmonary monitor, and the Wheezometer, a personal asthmatic assessment device.[73] Accelerometers produced by Analog Devices are included in ZOLL Medical's PocketCPR, which measures the depth of chest compressions and provides audible and visual feedback to a rescuer to allow adjustment to proper depth and to the correct rate of compression.[73]
Automotive[edit]
Analog Devices develops components for safety systems, such as stability control systems and driver assistance systems, infotainment and interior applications.[74] Powertrain systems in hybrid and electric vehicles use high-precision data conversion products in battery monitoring and control systems.
Industrial[edit]
Analog Devices industrial market[75] includes process control systems that help drive productivity, energy efficiency and reliability.[76][77]
Consumer[edit]
Analog Devices has technology for consumer electronics, which includes signal processing circuits for image processing, auto focus, and image stabilization for digital still cameras and camcorders, audio and video processors for home theater systems,[78] DVD recorders, and high-definition televisions and advanced touch screen controllers for portable media devices.[77]
Competitors[edit]
In 2009, Databeans published its report on the top semiconductor analog suppliers. Analog Devices was named number two with other suppliers including: Texas Instruments, National Semiconductor (acquired by Texas Instruments in 2011),[79] Maxim Integrated Products, Linear Technology.[80] Other competitors include: Infineon Technologies, STMicroelectronics and Intersil Corporation .[80] In 2011, Analog Devices was the third ranked analog semiconductor supplier.[81]
Analog Dialogue[edit]
In 1967, Analog Devices first published Analog Dialogue.[82] Dan Sheingold took the position of editor two years later, which he held for over four decades.[83][84] The current editor is Scott Wayne.[84] It is currently the longest-running in-house publication in the electronics industry.[85]
Analog Dialogue is a forum for the exchange of circuits, systems, and software for real-world signal processing and is the technical magazine published by Analog Devices.[85] It discusses products, applications, technology, and techniques for analog, digital, and mixed-signal processing. Analog Dialogue is published monthly on the Web. The featured technical articles are also compiled in quarterly print editions.
Communities[edit]
Community[edit]
In 2009, Analog Devices announced EngineerZone, an online technical support community.[86] EngineerZone was launched so the design engineering community (customers, prospects, partners, employees and students) can ask questions, share knowledge and search for answers to their questions in an open forum.[86]
Resources[edit]
Analog Devices circuits from the lab reference circuits are engineered and tested for quick system integration to help solve design challenges ranging from common to complex. Reference circuits are smaller, modular designs that are more broadly applicable than application-specific reference designs.
Each reference circuit is documented with test data, theory of operation, and component selection decision criteria. In addition, reference circuits are tailored to meet real-world system integration needs and may also include board layout schematics, CAD tools models, device drivers, and evaluation hardware.[87]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
