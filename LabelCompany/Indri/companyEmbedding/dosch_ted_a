A Passion for Helping Others Unites Anixter International
Ted Dosch feels most at home as a volunteer, so when he joined Anixter International he brought more than his financial expertise—he brought the communications and cabling company a new way to give back to communities around the world
March 15, 2016


			By			Kelli Lawrence | Photos by Caleb Fox






Anixter International found itself in a better-than-expected place shortly after its chief financial officer announced his retirement plans in 2009. Not only was the worldwide communications and electrical products distributor able to secure Ted Dosch—a veteran of more than twenty years at Whirlpool—as Anixter’s next CFO, it also created the most seamless of transitions by having Dosch work with the outgoing CFO during the remaining eighteen months of his career at Anixter.
Yet Dosch brought even more to Anixter than his finance-leadership experience at Whirlpool (including the co-lead role when Whirlpool acquired the $5 billion Maytag Corporation in 2006). He also contributed his connections with Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit home-building organization that Whirlpool has partnered with since 1999. Consequently, Anixter now partners with Habitat for Humanity as well—so much so that Dosch reports there are always more volunteers than available slots when a Habitat project comes Anixter’s way.
This likely comes as no surprise to Dosch, given how much he sees of one company in the other. “Anixter has many traits similar to Whirlpool in terms of culture, values, and integrity,” he says. “The more I learned about the company, the more I knew it would be a great fit for me.”
Ted Dosch leads by example when it comes to Anixter’s partnership with Chicagoland Habitat for Humanity. Anixter employees regularly participate in house builds and fundraisers.
Since officially assuming the CFO position in 2011, Dosch has put a great deal of focus on better aligning Anixter on a global basis around corporate functions, shared services, and financial planning and analysis. By building more consistent processes within each of those functions, he’s witnessing more efficiency in cost, consistency in quality, and better internal controls.
In short, each part is able to focus more on what it does best and help Anixter’s business leadership make better decisions. It’s an ongoing process—largely complete in North America and Europe, Dosch says, but still in progress in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Considering Anixter has purchased two businesses and undergone a major divestiture in the past year, Dosch is quite pleased with the alignment process thus far. “Not only have these strategic initiatives required a tremendous amount of work by many of the same people who were driving our process initiatives, but also it’s created an opportunity to drive some of the same disciplines into our newly acquired businesses,” he says.
Opportunities of a different kind abound for Anixter’s staff by way of the Anixter Cares program. Established by CEO Robert Eck with support from Dosch and Rod Smith, executive vice president of human resources, the program provides employees one paid day off a year to devote time to the charitable organization of their choice. With the creation of this program came the aforementioned Habitat for Humanity partnership—and a quick show of hands willing to volunteer. “I think Habitat for Humanity has quickly turned into a tremendous partnership for Anixter because our teams of people can get out there in very tangible and real ways and volunteer their time,” Dosch says.
Dosch has worked on Habitat homes on five different continents since 1998 and has served on various boards for the organization over the past decade. While moderate building experience helped get him started—“I was no stranger to a hammer growing up,” he admits—it’s the involvement with Habitat homeowners, who are required to meet a sweat equity requirement for building their own home, that cemented his commitment to the cause. “To build side by side with them. . . to see how hard they work to have a better life for their children . . . it’s had a tremendous impact on me, my wife, and our family,” he says. “That’s why Habitat for Humanity has become such a passion of mine.”
Realizations of what that “better life” means from country to country have stayed with Dosch through the years. He remembers the deplorable living conditions in a part of Cairo, Egypt, where most locals earned their meager living by collecting and sorting trash and lived in a big open area among the trash as well. In that case, Habitat built concrete-block structures to give families a place to live, sleep, and raise children at a slight distance from the squalor below.
In Macedonia, Dosch and other Habitat volunteers helped its Roma population construct cinder-block, one-room houses with concrete floors and corrugated tin roofs. Dosch recalls conversing with a homeowner who’d been living in cramped quarters built with scrap lumber and a dirt floor. “I asked if she was excited to be moving into her new home and tearing down the old place. She seemed confused by the question,” Dosch says. “Then the translator explained that they wouldn’t be tearing the ‘old place’ down because there was a relative waiting to move in. As poor as the ‘old place’ was, it was actually better than where another family member currently lived.”
Habitat building projects continue abroad and in both rural and urban areas across the United States. In 2014, numerous corporate sponsors—Anixter included—gathered at Michigan Avenue’s Pioneer Plaza in downtown Chicago and took action to solve the metro area’s substandard housing crisis by building a house and enough wall sections for twelve other houses. “It created a great opportunity for Anixter and these other generous companies to give their employees the opportunity to give back and help improve the communities in which we live,” Dosch says.
Considering Anixter employees have been known to volunteer and contribute to half a dozen different Habitat projects at a time throughout the Chicago area, the need is obvious. “There are about 400,000 people living in substandard housing across the Chicagoland area,” Dosch points out. “So you don’t have to go all the way to Macedonia or Egypt. We have tremendous opportunities to help families right here at home.”

Anixter International Inc. Announces the Acquisition of the Power 
      Solutions Segment of HD Supply





        Transforms Anixter into a leading North American electrical 
        distribution platform
      

        Significantly expands electrical and utility product portfolio and 
        customer relationships
      

        Expected to be accretive to EPS in the first year post-closing
      






July 15, 2015 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anixter International Inc. (NYSE: AXE) today announced that it has 
      entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Power Solutions 
      segment of HD Supply for $825 million, subject to customary post-closing 
      working capital and other adjustments. The acquisition, which is the 
      largest in Anixter’s history, is expected to be accretive to earnings in 
      the first full year of operation, exclusive of transaction, one-time 
      integration expenses and incremental amortization of intangible assets. 
      The acquisition is expected to result in future tax benefits from 
      acquired U.S. intangible assets with a net present value estimated to be 
      approximately $70 million.
    


      Headquartered in Atlanta, Power Solutions distributes over 200,000 
      utility, electrical and industrial MRO products to approximately 13,000 
      customers including investor-owned utilities, public power utilities, 
      electrical contractors and industrial businesses. Operating from a broad 
      geographic footprint of approximately 130 branches in 30 U.S. states and 
      4 Canadian provinces, Power Solutions reported fiscal 2014 revenue of 
      $1.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $79 million.
    

      “Power Solutions is a compelling strategic acquisition for Anixter. 
      Consistent with our message that we are sharpening our focus, this 
      transaction will significantly enhance our competitive position in the 
      electrical wire and cable business and further strengthen our customer 
      and supplier value proposition. In addition to transforming our existing 
      utility business into a leading North American distributor to the 
      utility sector, this acquisition will enable us to provide a full line 
      electrical solution to our existing customers and will provide us with 
      broader access to the mid-size electrical construction market,” said Bob 
      Eck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anixter. “Like Anixter, 
      Power Solutions has built their business on providing complex supply 
      chain services and value added distribution to their customers. We look 
      forward to the talented Power Solutions team joining the Anixter family 
      when the transaction closes. Together, we will offer broader solutions 
      to our respective customers and substantial long-term growth and value 
      creation for all Anixter stakeholders.”
    

      John Tisera, President of Power Solutions, stated, “We are excited to 
      have access to Anixter’s broad portfolio of products, services and 
      technical expertise which will allow us to further expand our customer 
      offerings. The strategic rationale of this combination is strengthened 
      by our shared culture of partnering with both our customers and 
      world-class suppliers to bring value to their businesses.”
    

      “This acquisition combined with the September 2014 acquisition of Tri-Ed 
      and the June 2015 sale of our OEM – Supply Fasteners segment completes a 
      transformation of our global platform and results in a portfolio that is 
      well-positioned for substantial and sustainable long term growth,” said 
      Ted Dosch, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “With 
      our attention now focused on the successful integration of these 
      businesses and maximizing their synergistic value, we expect to generate 
      significant free cash flow to support our balanced capital allocation 
      strategy, including a return to our long term target of 45-50 percent 
      debt-to-total capital ratio within the short to medium term.”
    

      Subject to regulatory approval and certain customary closing conditions, 
      this transaction is expected to close near the end of the third quarter 
      of 2015 and will be financed using available cash and additional 
      borrowings. We expect to have full commitment on financing in place 
      prior to closing. The majority of transaction and integration costs will 
      be incurred in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Additional financial details 
      will be provided in our second quarter 2015 earnings release on July 28, 
      2015.

      & Flom LLP served as legal counsel, and KPMG LLP served as accounting 
      advisor to Anixter on the transaction.

Safe Harbor Statement


Statements in this press release regarding the proposed transaction, 
      the expected timetable for completing the transaction, and any other 
      statements about our managements’ future expectations, beliefs, goals, 
      plans or prospects constitute forward looking statements within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any 
      statements that are not statements of historical fact should also be 
      considered to be forward looking statements. There are a number 
      of important factors that could cause actual events to differ materially 
      from those indicated by such forward looking statements, including: the 
      ability to consummate the transaction; the risk that regulatory 
      approvals required for the contemplated transaction are not obtained or 
      are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the risk 
      that the financing required to fund the transaction is not obtained; the 
      risk that the other conditions to the closing of the transaction are not 
      satisfied; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or 
      employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement 
      or completion of the transaction; uncertainties as to the timing of the 
      closing; any changes in general economic and/or industry specific 
      conditions; and the other factors described in our Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the year ended January 2, 2015 and our most recent 
      Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q each filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission. We expressly disclaim any intention or 
      obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of 
      developments occurring after the date of this press release.


Non-GAAP Financial Measures


This release includes certain financial measures computed using 
      non-GAAP components as defined by the SEC. Non-GAAP financial measures 
      provide insight into selected financial information and should be 
      evaluated in the context in which they are presented. These non-GAAP 
      financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not 
      be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial 
      information presented in compliance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial 
      measures may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by 
      other companies. Management does not use these non-GAAP financial 
      measures for any purpose other than the reasons stated above.


EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations before 
      interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA 
      is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange and other non-operating 
      expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, excluding the other 
      special items from reported financial results, as defined above. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is a useful indicator 
      of our performance and our ability to meet debt service requirements. It 
      is not, however, intended as an alternative measure of operating results 
      or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with generally 
      accepted accounting principles.
