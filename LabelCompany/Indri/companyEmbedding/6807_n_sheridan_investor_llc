Investors see Rogers Park, Edgewater as Chicago's next destinations for priced-out North Siders

Ally MarottiContact ReporterChicago Tribune




An out-of-town joint venture has paid almost $18.9 million for a mixed-use building in Rogers Park, joining other investors in a neighborhood attractive to young professionals searching for cheaper rents on Chicago's North Side.Spirit Bascom Ventures bought the 160-unit Sheridan Court Apartments in a deal that closed last week, said Scott Zwilling, principal with Stamford, Conn.-based Spirit Investment Partners, one-half of the Spirit Bascom joint venture."We've been looking at the northern neighborhoods a lot in Chicago," Zwilling said. "We're seeing a huge migration of young millennials and young professionals that are getting priced out of the more expensive areas."The nine-story building at 6807 N. Sheridan Road is one block from the beach, and four blocks north of the Loyola stop on the CTA Red Line. Spirit Bascom plans to renovate the 1920s-era building to help fill the area's void in luxury rental units.

It is the second building Spirit Bascom has acquired in the area in just more than a year. The joint venture, a partnership between Spirit Investment Partners and Irvine, Calif.-based Bascom Group, bought a 223-unit building at 5200 N. Sheridan in Edgewater Beach in November 2015.Renovations underway at that building, now called The Edison, include stone countertops, stainless steel appliances and a rooftop deck.Zwilling declined to comment on specific renovation plans for Sheridan Court but the building will get a new name.The seller of both buildings was Skokie-based Kopley Group, which bought Sheridan Court in December 2001 for $9.75 million.

Kopley took advantage of a market investors are doubling down on, said Todd Stofflet, managing partner for Chicago-based brokerage firm KIG, who represented the Kopley Group in the sale."Rogers Park has seen a little bit of a renaissance recently," Stofflet said. "There's a big rent spread between that and downtown, but until recently there hasn't been any new product or renovated product to live in."Loyola University's proximity continues to be a draw for investors. But the area's existing rental stock is generating new interest from institutional investors, backed by pension funds or real estate investment trusts, that are confident in their ability to attract tenants, said Lee Kiser, principal of Chicago commercial real estate brokerage Kiser Group.Traditionally, those types of investors stuck to newly constructed high-rises downtown, he said.In August, Chicago-based Golub & Co. and real estate private equity firm Alcion Ventures paid $37 million for a 20-story apartment building at 5600 N. Sheridan that will be renovated.Clients of Kiser are acquiring three buildings with 109 units in Edgewater Beach in a deal set to close Thursday, and another four buildings in Rogers Park next month.Increased investor interest could cause a problem for tenants who can't afford the rent increases that could come with newly renovated apartments."That's sort of what the process for pricing people out of a neighborhood might look like," Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.Average rents in the Rogers Park neighborhood have increased 12 percent in the last five years, according to data from KIG. In Edgewater, average rents increased 19 percent over the same time period.amarotti@chicagotribune.comTwitter @AllyMarotti

5206 N Sheridan RdChicago, IL 60640

I have rented from them for a year now and dont have one negative thing to say. The apartment building is clean and nice. This is including the front area, hallways and laundry room. The building manager is so amazing! she contacts you when you have a package, notifies maintenance promptly and remembers everyone by name.
 Another thing I love about this building is the 24/7 emergency maintenance they have. I came home from work at 2am to my power not being on. I called them, and they had it fixed within 20 minutes.
 Also, at my old apartment I had to mail my check in before the 1st, if it got to the office a day later, they would charge me! Here, all i have to do is hand the check in to Deborah by the first. Quick and easy, especially when you have a crazy schedule.

If you get the chance to rent through them, I highly recommend it!







I previously lived at 6807 N Sheridan Rd and had an awful experience. The building has roaches and bed bugs. The property manager was rude and performed half assed work. I stayed on the 8th floor and every time I went into the trash room I saw roaches running around. I had to have exterminators come to my place numerous times for bug issues. DO NOT MOVE INTO THIS BUILDING.







I lived at 6807 N. Sheridan Rd. for two years, and for the last four months the Kopley Group has allowed the elevators for a nine-story high-rise malfunction without proper repair. Every other day I'd come home from work and find myself having to make a six-story walk up to my apartment after working on my feet for ten hours. Deb, the landlady, kept saying "they're working on getting a new elevator," but Kopley would never let the residents know of the actual plans or progress.

Many elderly and disabled residents were affected by this elevator outage on a regular basis, with no remedy.

When I gave notice of moving out, Deb did not let me know that the freight elevator would only be operating one day of that weekend until five days beforehand, forcing me to scramble to find new moving plans. Marco, the superintendent and handyman, refuses to accommodate the needs of the tenants and leaves people with no leeway for alternate plans. 

The Kopley Group is, ultimately, just another unethical and negligent landlord. Don't expect anything else.







Terrible experience.  Nancy Stanley, Kopey Group, has been unresponsive, it takes 2+ weeks to hear from her.  Terrible experience.  Our place continues to flood/mold and Nancy is unresponsive.  When we eventually connect, she tells us to pay our full rent.  Find another property to rent.







I lived at the 5200 Sheridan Rd. location for a year, from 2013 to 2014. The staff was friendly and helpful, the 24/7 doorman and engineer were a nice touch, and both moving in and moving out was stress free. I definitely recommend The Kopley Group to people looking for affordable Edgewater housing. My only complaint is that the elevators were badly in need of a renovation. The second of the two elevators broke down over the winter and was never repaired during the time I lived at the building. Speaking of elevators, the freight elevator is very old and finicky; there aren't even buttons, just a dial for up and down, so be aware of that.







The Kopley Group was wonderful to rent from - and trust me, over the past 10 years I have dealt with some real nightmares.

Nancy was wonderful to work with throughout my time with their company.  I rarely had any issues with my unit, but if I did, they were there to repair right away.  I wish more Chicago management companies realized the importance of customer service  - The Kopley Group surely does.

I would rent from them again in a heartbeat!







Their building at 5200 Sheridan has a bad bed bug infestation as other online reports will confirm. I found bugs in my unit right after moving in. I also caught the management talking to an exterminator about another infested unit, and then I met another tenant with bed bugs who had just moved in; she lived on the other side of the building from me. I found out all of this after living there for two weeks and I wasn't even trying to investigate. 

I then got into a big confrontation with two managers when they refused to reimburse me for a mattress cover for the bed bugs, even though I had a document stating that they would. They simply said that document was old and they will now go back and delete any copies; I had just received that paper a couple of weeks prior. One then started saying I should just move out, and then she shut the window on me.

If you do not encounter beg bugs in your unit, the managers will seem like your best friends. But there seems to be a good chance you will get bed bugs in this building, and then you quickly see another side of the office ladies.







As with most rental companies, your experience will depend partly on your location. Personally, The Kopley Group has been the most professional, responsive, and organized of the rental companies I've used in Chicago, with the nicest, cleanest, safest building. 

I rented a studio at the 6807 N Sheridan (Sheridan/Pratt) location last year. I secured the place online, sight-unseen, from out of state. The company made this very easy, and luckily there were no nasty surprises when I came to move in. 

The building was large, with laundry and a management office on-site (which made it possible to drop rent off rather than mail it).The manager was a pleasant enough craggy old woman who was generally very responsive and helpful. The maintenance guy, Marco, was also very pleasant and did good work. I was always notified way ahead of time when the building was having work done, when exterminators were coming in, etc. A monthly newsletter with recipes and other cute random tidbits was slid under the door. 

I never saw any bugs, other than spiders on the outside of the windowsill. The studio I rented was huge, two-rooms, with a separate kitchen and a walk-in closet that a friend used as a guest room for a week! Seriously, this place was practically a one-bedroom. At the time it was $650, utilities included (except internet). For the space and utilities, it was a great deal. 

Now, the neighbors on one side were loud and suspicious (I called the cops on them when I heard slapping and crying; they hid most of the family when the police came, pretending there was only two of them living in the apartment), but I never felt unsafe. The building was secure. The water pressure in the bathroom was spotty, especially during the morning when everyone was getting ready for work- the water would shift from hot to cold wildly, and annoyingly. But everything worked. 

I didn't think the apartment was a great, lucky deal at the time I had it. However, in the last few years I have rented some true shitholes with truly negligent rental companies. If you are a studio renter with a limitied budget, you can stand to do a lot lot worse than Kopley.







I lived in this apartment building for about 2 years while I was going to school nearby. It was the nicest and most reasonable out of all the apartments I looked at in the area. The staff was friendly and professional and the apartment was a lot bigger than the other studios I looked at in the area. The only issues I ever had were the lights going out quite often when I had the microwave going and too many lights (or the TV) on. That was somewhat annoying. I also had a few instances when strangers knocked on my door asking for money...other than that I felt pretty safe as a young girl living along int the city can feel. The 711 right below is also nice. I would recommended taking a tour of their apartments and seeing if they are a right fit for you.







I have never rented from a better company. 

I had a place at 6807 N Sheridan. The landlady, Deborah, is incredibly nice and helpful. She has an office on the first floor, so you can just drop in during business hours to take care of rent or let her know of any problems. If there is a problem, one of the maintenance guys was at my place within the hour to fix it.

I had one loud neighbor, but the walls in the building are so thick, it wasn't too bad of a problem. The building had a very friendly vibe - much more so than any other place I ever lived. We can probably attribute this to Deborah.

The building itself was (I believe) a luxury hotel from the 1930s. The lobby kind of has that feeling, which is fun.

I can't recommend them enough. I just wish they rented apartments closer to my new job so I could keep doing business with Kopley.







When my roommate and I decided to go our separate ways from our Rogers Park apartment, i decided to find a studio.  I rented from the 6807 N. Sheridan building and was set to move in mid September 2013  since the apartment would not be ready until then.  I moved in on a Saturday, but Wednesday I realized I was getting bit. As I was finally about to start unpacking, I found a weird bug in the closet.  I took pics of it and searched online.  It looked similar to a bed bug but it was brown.  I went to sleep that night and woke up to more bites.  The next day I found more information online about the life cycle of bed bugs. I realized the bedbug I found was brown because it wasn't full of blood. I called the building management and told them about finding bed bugs and that I needed to move. How scarey is that to move into a new apartment and to get bit by bugs less than a week later? They let me out of my lease and I moved the following Saturday. Was only in the apartment for a week.  I was so paranoid after that that I ended up throwing away a third of my stuff in fear of taking them to my new apartment, including my 5 month old new dresser.  I was very paranoid for a long time. My roommate and I did not have bed bugs in our building and this new building tried to make it seem as though they've never had bed bugs. Told me that they didn't have any report of them in that unit. Excuse me? They can crawl through the walls. Maybe they came from the apartment next to mine of from the ones above or below. When I looked on Bed Bug Registry website, I saw 2 reports for that address from 2010 and 2011.  All in all I found about 8 bed bugs as I started to pack up my apartment. I collected them and showed the building manager, he still told me that they did not find any bed bugs as he had someone to inspect my apartment during the time I went to pick up my truck when I moved out. Lies. I showed him the ones I collected in a bowl!  I would never rent from this management company ever again! It was one of the most stressful experience in my life!  I hated that they acted as though their building didn't have bed bugs.  They are extremely hard to get rid of and from my research I found out that they can live in the walls with no food supply for up to 18 months.  They did not give me a straight answer and avoided to answer all together when I asked if they ever had bed bugs.  Also as I asked other tenants whether or not they had bed bugs, one guy was visiting his girlfriend and told me that she had bed bugs 2 years ago but they got rid of them.  Obviously they didn't rid of all of them. 

I had high hopes for this apartment because it was a nice sized studio with two huge closets and it was a good deal with all utilities included with a bus stop right in front.  I was looking forward to living here but because of the bed bugs, I started getting stressed, the aftermath affected my semester in school, I lost a week's worth of rent and had to move last minute into an apartment that was higher than what I wanted to pay, and threw away approximately $400 worth of stuff.







We've lived in two apartments from Kopley. Not high quality- there are cords and wires sticking out in strange places and everything is covered in a thick coat of blinding white paint. And parts of the floorboards underneath the radiators are rotting out. The location is great though.

Dealing with Kopley has at times been great and at others infuriating. When we have had maintenance problems in the bathroom and a bedbug scare they responded immediately. The maintenance man is great.

However, some of the personnel in the main office, particularly whoever is in charge of billing, etc, are monsters. They gave us such a hard time when we first rented from them that almost made us both cry. They attempted to cash two of my rent checks as one month's rent. They do not respond timely to rent issues and they are frankly rude and unpleasant to deal with.







Bed bug infestations were reported on at least three floors of one of their buildings. Management chose to do treatments with chemicals purchased at the hardware store rather than call professionals, and the problem is just as bad and no doubt spreading.  Don't rent with these people; they will not take care of their responsibility. (They will even argue that vermin control is not their responsibility, but Chicago law states otherwise.)







As a management company, I could not recommend them more highly.  They were great to work with from the very start.  Friendly, courteous and very fair.  I felt valued as a tenant which says a great deal.  Nick, my building manager was incredible.  Very quick to respond to any need whatsoever.







We rent through them and they're great. They've been super nice about everything and very helpful. Definitely would recommend them.

The maintenance guy, Marco, was also very pleasant and did good work. I was always notified way ahead of time when the building was having work done, when exterminators were coming in, etc. A monthly newsletter with recipes and other cute random tidbits was slid under the door. I never saw any bugs, other than spiders on the outside of the windowsill. The studio I rented was huge, two-rooms, with a separate kitchen and a walk-in closet that a friend used as a guest room for a week! Seriously, this place was practically a one-bedroom. At the time it was $650, utilities included (except internet). For the space and utilities, it was a great deal. Now, the neighbors on one side were loud and suspicious (I called the cops on them when I heard slapping and crying; they hid most of the family when the police came, pretending there was only two of them living in the apartment), but I never felt unsafe. The building was secure. The water pressure in the bathroom was spotty, especially during the morning when everyone was getting ready for work- the water would shift from hot to cold wildly, and annoyingly. But everything worked. I didn't think the apartment was a great, lucky deal at the time I had it. However, in the last few years I have rented some true shitholes with truly negligent rental companies. If you are a studio renter with a limitied budget, you can stand to do a lot lot worse than Kopley.

I lived in this apartment building for about 2 years while I was going to school nearby. It was the nicest and most reasonable out of all the apartments I looked at in the area. The staff was friendly and professional and the apartment was a lot bigger than the other studios I looked at in the area. The only issues I ever had were the lights going out quite often when I had the microwave going and too many lights (or the TV) on. That was somewhat annoying. I also had a few instances when strangers knocked on my door asking for money...other than that I felt pretty safe as a young girl living along int the city can feel. The 711 right below is also nice. I would recommended taking a tour of their apartments and seeing if they are a right fit for you.

I have never rented from a better company. I had a place at 6807 N Sheridan. The landlady, Deborah, is incredibly nice and helpful. She has an office on the first floor, so you can just drop in during business hours to take care of rent or let her know of any problems. If there is a problem, one of the maintenance guys was at my place within the hour to fix it.I had one loud neighbor, but the walls in the building are so thick, it wasn't too bad of a problem. The building had a very friendly vibe - much more so than any other place I ever lived. We can probably attribute this to Deborah.The building itself was (I believe) a luxury hotel from the 1930s. The lobby kind of has that feeling, which is fun.I can't recommend them enough. I just wish they rented apartments closer to my new job so I could keep doing business with Kopley.

When my roommate and I decided to go our separate ways from our Rogers Park apartment, i decided to find a studio.  I rented from the 6807 N. Sheridan building and was set to move in mid September 2013  since the apartment would not be ready until then.  I moved in on a Saturday, but Wednesday I realized I was getting bit. As I was finally about to start unpacking, I found a weird bug in the closet.  I took pics of it and searched online.  It looked similar to a bed bug but it was brown.  I went to sleep that night and woke up to more bites.  The next day I found more information online about the life cycle of bed bugs. I realized the bedbug I found was brown because it wasn't full of blood. I called the building management and told them about finding bed bugs and that I needed to move. How scarey is that to move into a new apartment and to get bit by bugs less than a week later? They let me out of my lease and I moved the following Saturday. Was only in the apartment for a week.  I was so paranoid after that that I ended up throwing away a third of my stuff in fear of taking them to my new apartment, including my 5 month old new dresser.  I was very paranoid for a long time. My roommate and I did not have bed bugs in our building and this new building tried to make it seem as though they've never had bed bugs. Told me that they didn't have any report of them in that unit. Excuse me? They can crawl through the walls. Maybe they came from the apartment next to mine of from the ones above or below. When I looked on Bed Bug Registry website, I saw 2 reports for that address from 2010 and 2011.  All in all I found about 8 bed bugs as I started to pack up my apartment. I collected them and showed the building manager, he still told me that they did not find any bed bugs as he had someone to inspect my apartment during the time I went to pick up my truck when I moved out. Lies. I showed him the ones I collected in a bowl!  I would never rent from this management company ever again! It was one of the most stressful experience in my life!  I hated that they acted as though their building didn't have bed bugs.  They are extremely hard to get rid of and from my research I found out that they can live in the walls with no food supply for up to 18 months.  They did not give me a straight answer and avoided to answer all together when I asked if they ever had bed bugs.  Also as I asked other tenants whether or not they had bed bugs, one guy was visiting his girlfriend and told me that she had bed bugs 2 years ago but they got rid of them.  Obviously they didn't rid of all of them. I had high hopes for this apartment because it was a nice sized studio with two huge closets and it was a good deal with all utilities included with a bus stop right in front.  I was looking forward to living here but because of the bed bugs, I started getting stressed, the aftermath affected my semester in school, I lost a week's worth of rent and had to move last minute into an apartment that was higher than what I wanted to pay, and threw away approximately $400 worth of stuff.

We've lived in two apartments from Kopley. Not high quality- there are cords and wires sticking out in strange places and everything is covered in a thick coat of blinding white paint. And parts of the floorboards underneath the radiators are rotting out. The location is great though.Dealing with Kopley has at times been great and at others infuriating. When we have had maintenance problems in the bathroom and a bedbug scare they responded immediately. The maintenance man is great.However, some of the personnel in the main office, particularly whoever is in charge of billing, etc, are monsters. They gave us such a hard time when we first rented from them that almost made us both cry. They attempted to cash two of my rent checks as one month's rent. They do not respond timely to rent issues and they are frankly rude and unpleasant to deal with.

Bed bug infestations were reported on at least three floors of one of their buildings. Management chose to do treatments with chemicals purchased at the hardware store rather than call professionals, and the problem is just as bad and no doubt spreading.  Don't rent with these people; they will not take care of their responsibility. (They will even argue that vermin control is not their responsibility, but Chicago law states otherwise.)

As a management company, I could not recommend them more highly.  They were great to work with from the very start.  Friendly, courteous and very fair.  I felt valued as a tenant which says a great deal.  Nick, my building manager was incredible.  Very quick to respond to any need whatsoever.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
