			About
        


I’m a software and systems engineer, hands-on manager, and lifelong “medtech nerd” – even in high school, I was a co-winner of the Long Island Science Congress for developing  a wireless temperature sensor system that was implanted in a rat.
At Cornell I earned my degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Neurobiology.  Since then, I’ve primarily worked in the design and development of medical devices and some other high-reliability products.  My passion is in working with fellow technologists and diverse stakeholders to turn innovative technologies into real products that fill a need, and that people like to use.
I also enjoy writing and speaking.  My book, Prototype to Product: A Practical Guide for Getting to Market (O’Reilly Media) is now for sale,and a while back I authored a textbook on computer communications that sold more than 20,000 copies.  I’ve also written a number of articles on various topics, and spoken at venues include ESC, DesignMed, and a keynote address at RTECC.

“A diamond is a piece of coal, that finished what it started”.
Douglas R. ForrestalPresidentRy'leco Displays




It was truly a pleasure working with Alan; it is clear from our work he recognizes that litigation is a distraction for business. Alan aggressively pursues a timely resolution on the behalf of his clients in a creative fashion.
Julieann M. ThurlowPresident & CEOReading Co-operative Bank



Since 2011 our company has been utilizing the collection services of Alan M. Cohen LLC. We are a company with over 1500 retail accounts owned primarily by individuals which makes it very difficult to follow traditional commercial collections protocol.

Steve MoscaritoloFinancial ControllerAmerican Florist Supply, Inc



We reached out to Alan Cohen for help with a collection that dated back to 2011. Within a 60 day period, Alan’s results exceeded our expectations. Alan was able to recover the full principle along with interest. His diligence, thoroughness and attention to detail was second to none. I would highly recommend the Law Offices of Alan M. Cohen for any …
Joseph R. Harold IIISagamore Plumbing & Heating, INC.



The Law Offices of Alan M. Cohen did an excellent job of obtaining funds on a delinquent note for our company. Alan worked expeditiously through the court process to get a judgement that got us paid. The effort was all Alan’s, our involvement was minimal so we could spend our time focusing on our business. I highly recommend Alan.

Alan Cohen and team are true professionals – concise, competent, straight forward and action oriented. We had been working on collecting from an account for over a year when I finally contacted Alan.

To all you creditors stumbling around out there playing patty-cake with your debtors: What are you thinking?

Stephen P. MillikenCredit and Collections ManagerPatriot Flooring Supply, Inc.




I was introduced to Alan by my IP attorney, as I had a collections matter that needed urgent attention. Alan drove in the same day I called him and started producing results immediately. The case evolved into a long, drawn-out affair due to opposing council taking advantage of the Court, but ultimately we prevailed. Working with Alan, I learned tha…

I contracted with Alan Cohen to collect on a Texas Judgment from a client in Massachusetts.

I expected to hear the same “I can”, only to find out “I can’t” that I often hear from Texas Judgment Recovery Attorneys.

Not with Alan Cohen!

The 8 year old judgment was resolved in less than 2 weeks.

Alan is one of the best attorneys in his field.

Lawsuits are hard. They are hard on everyone-­‐ No question about it!  I interviewed lots of attorneys in Massachusetts, finding that most were wiling to take my case without even knowing what it was about.  They talked about their successes, about their practice, their fees, and rarely about what I needed.  I was just one more opportunity for a re…

How We Do It

 Ex Parte Bank and Real Estate AttachmentsWe seek to freeze monies in your debtor’s bank accounts to secure an immediate means of collecting when you win. We use real estate attachments to secure an eventual payment from your debtor.
 Reach and Apply InjunctionsMassachusetts statute allows a creditor to force a third party who owes monies to the debtor to directly pay the creditor. The reach and apply injunction intercepts the debtor’s income stream thereby providing a means of getting you paid.
 Mechanic’s LiensIn the construction industry, the mechanic’s lien allows a supplier, general contractor or subcontractor to place a lien on the property improved by their services or materials even if no contract exists with the property owner.
 Post Judgment CollectionAfter we win your case, we aggressively use post judgment discovery to search for your debtor’s assets. We subpoena the debtor’s bank records and follow the money trail to try to get you paid.
 Levy and Sale of Debtor’s AssetsAfter judgment we send the sheriff to levy upon the debtor’s assets including real estate and personal property. Depending on available equity we direct the sheriff to sell the debtor’s assets to get you paid.
 Collect Foreign JudgmentsUnlike in other states, collection of a foreign judgment in Massachusetts requires filing a new lawsuit. Attorney Alan M. Cohen has decades of experience enforcing foreign judgments in Massachusetts.
