Bio-AMD, Inc.; Second Quarter Update
Bio-AMD, Inc.; Second Quarter Update
Daresbury, England August  16, 2016; Bio-AMD, Inc. and Bio-AMD UK Holdings Ltd., our majority owned medical devices subsidiary (together “Bio-AMD”, “We” or the “Company” OTCQB: BIAD) here provides a second quarter update.
COAG
Following withdrawal of a development partner for our Point of Care (“PoC)” prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (“PT/INR”) monitoring system development project earlier this year the Company has actively sought a new, suitable partner to continue the development of its COAG technology. COAG is aimed at patients using Warfarin based oral anticoagulants to enable them to more easily manage their medication dosage and coagulation within a safe therapeutic range.
We continue to believe that our clinically verified COAG test strip, based on a direct mechanical rather than electrochemical measurement of clotting time, is best in class. Electrochemical devices are inherently susceptive to confounding factors, such as other medical conditions, which have caused fatal measurement inaccuracies. The US Food and Drug Administration is very much alive to these issues and has proposed tightened accuracy guidelines, which the Company believes it can easily meet with COAG.
The current PoC and self-test PT/INR market, projected to grow to around $1 billion p.a. in the next few years, is currently dominated by a single company’s electrochemical based device. In July of this year this dominance was amplified when the former #2 PoC PT/INR monitor, also an electrochemical device, was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its maker on FDA advice, following a FDA investigation into accuracy concerns. Another planned device for self-test, based on an electrochemical test strip supplied to a major for professional PT/INR testing, has recently been abandoned. We believe that these developments reflect, in some part, the challenges of accuracy and FDA requirements, current and prospective.
Our COAG test strip has demonstrated that it can deliver market leading accuracy and reliability by a direct, mechanical coagulation measurement, even prior to optimization in a final device. We believe that our COAG strip is the ideal solution to current PoC PT/INR measurement accuracy issues. The Company has engaged with and has provided information to a number of interested parties active in PoC and coagulation testing in its efforts to find a replacement development partner for COAG. Discussions are ongoing.
MIDS Project Commences
The Company, in partnership with a nano-cap medical detection technology company has commenced the first stage of development of the Company’s novel MIDS universal immunoassay device technology (“MIDS Project”).
This development is initially focussed on applying our patented MIDS technology into a rapid-test, PoC cardiac event detection device able to process High Sensitivity (HS) Troponin tests. These HS tests can currently only be assayed on large, expensive central laboratory equipment.  Currently work is underway to confirm and demonstrate that the MIDS technology platform is accurate for the detection and quantitation of small quantities of magnetic nano-particles such as those used in these HS tests. Electronics design is in progress to produce the printed circuit board suitable for bench testing and optimising the design of the highly sensitive, bespoke Hall effect sensors central to the magnetic detection of target nanoparticles.
The Company believes there is a large potential market for highly accurate cardiac marker assays conducted by a hand held device at the Point of Care (“PoC”). The MIDS Project aim is to develop an easy to use, hand-held device which can achieve gold standard central laboratory accuracy, or better, at a fraction of the capital cost, with results delivered at the PoC within minutes.

Why invest in BIAD?

"Point of Care diagnostic market expected to be worth over $20 billion by 2014"





Healthcare is changing with a global imperative to speed up the diagnostic process at reduced cost. The market is driven by both patient demand and the need to deliver cost savings to cash strapped health services. Hand held medical devices offering rapid diagnostic tests can replace slow laboratory analysis on large, expensive machines, across a wide range of indications, addressing both speed and cost issues.


One example of how Point of Care (PoC) testing has transformed patient testing is in blood glucose monitoring: Prior to PoC blood glucose monitors being available, testing involved expensive and inconvenient clinic visits. With the advent of cost-effective PoC devices a new market was opened up, rapidly expanding to over $8 billion.





The Right Market









BIAD  has two developed technologies (patents pending) for DSR (Digital Strip Reader) and COAG (Blood Coagulation Monitor). These are ready for commercialization. BIAD is currently in discussions with potential partners for both.
BIAD has a patent application relating to a third exciting technology, MPR (Magnetic Particle Reader)  has significant potential with much wider point of care diagnostic application, opening up new testing markets globally.





The Right Technologies: Already Interesting Global Players









BIAD’s business model is geared towards creating profitability quickly with the minimum risk and cost. This is expected to be achieved by licensing technologies to large players in the POC market avoiding manufacturing, marketing and sales costs to take advantage of the quickest route to substantial revenues through main player distribution channels.





The Right Business Model













The scientists behind BIAD’s medical devices have developed our two leading technologies, DSR and COAG, at a very efficient cost to BIAD and at a fraction of the investment applied to competitive technologies.
These technologies have now generated interest from giant global players to the point where we are in discussions about commercial development and licensing for both products.




What makes BIAD Technology so special?











COAG Technology Advantages
BlAD’s technology meets the shortcomings of available devices, combining substantially lower manufacturing costs with other key features, setting COAG aside in this developing market:

Lab accuracy to give patient day to day control of anti-coagulant intake
State of the art digital electronics and embedded software
Unique blood detection design (blood and plasma); very low volume whole blood sample 5 µLiters (‘Finger-stick’) required
Fast response test result
Temperature control with direct strip measurement
External power supply and battery
USB connection for data output
Internal memory
Easy to use

U.S. patented technology currently in commercial development with a global partner.
BIAD has developed a new hand-held meter technology using combined magnetic/optical detection sensors to allow self-testing and monitoring for patients at risk from the formation of blood clots. Warfarin is the common, tried, trusted and cheap long-term anticoagulant medication. Blood clotting time must, however, be carefully monitored to ensure safe dosage, resulting in regular and inconvenient clinic visits.
A hand held home testing market has started to develop, however the current devices available are both expensive and some require an uncomfortable blood sample size.
As a result, the current market is in its infancy. 9 out of 10 patients on Warfarin want to be more involved in their care decisions but over half of those not yet using a monitor don’t even know that self-testing is possible! A massive market is yet to be tapped with an estimated 7,000,000 patients on Warfarin in the Western World, with 2,000,000 patients being prescribed Warfarin each year in the US alone. In the UK, only 3% of UK heart patients on Warfarin who might benefit from self-testing do so, resulting in an additional 1.2 million person target market.
The Patient Self-Testing (PST) market consists of both device sales and repeat sales of tests strips and even though this market is highly immature the current market value of Coagulation PST is estimated at $750 million.
There are 3 main PST devices currently on the market. They are all relatively expensive and require differing sizes of blood sample, a minimum obviously being preferable to the patient and an important purchase consideration. BIAD believes its technology to be superior to any of the existing PST devices and, with the right partner, has the potential to rapidly penetrate and expand this massive market.

            "Simple and effective home testing for 7 million patients in the Western World on Warfarin based therapies"
            "There is significant consolidation in the medical device space, with global majors acquiring targets with unique technologies that fit with their strategy"
          














DSR Technology Advantages

New technology and new IP (patents filed)
Unique interlocked cartridge cap
Unique quad light sensor array
Clear digital LCD output to minimise errors
Environmentally friendly – no batteries (fully disposable)
High sensitivity (semi-quantitative measurement)
Tolerance free system
Low manufacturing cost (higher profit margin)
Adaptable to multiple markets: can read any lateral flow strip using colour change
Easy to use








A universal digital strip readers for use across a wide range of applications initially focused as a next generation Digital Pregnancy Test for the OTC, home use market.
DSR is easily adapted into related product areas and the next step will be expansion into ovulation and fertility testing. Other potential markets include cholesterol (life style testing), cardiac markers, drugs of abuse and infectious diseases e.g. HIV, syphilis, H. Plyori and Chlamydia.
Globally the female well being market is dominated by three main players. There is a growing migration from analogue testing towards smarter digital devices to meet consumer demand. The US market alone is estimated at 20 million pregnancy and ovulation tests per year and it is estimated that $1.68 billion of pregnancy tests are sold globally each year.
The leading digital test currently dominates the digital pregnancy test market.
Elsewhere in pregnancy testing, the largest supplier in the North American region is reliant on old fashioned, optical tests, as is the market leader in Europe.
These manufacturers are believed to be either seeking a Digital Test, or to improve on what they already have.

Digital Strip Reader

The first stage of our corporate strategy has been to develop a universal digital strip reader (DSR). Key features include:
Unique interlocked cartridge cap
Unique Quad Solar Cell light sensor array
Clear digital LCD output to minimise errors
Environmentally friendly – No batteries or chemicals (fully disposable)
High sensitivity (semi-quantitative measurement)
Tolerance free system
Low manufacturing cost (higher profit margin)
Ability to read any lateral flow strip including those using colour change
Ease of use
To see the DSR in action go here: DSR movie.
The DSR has a wide range of applications. We have focused our commercial efforts initially on a next generation pregnancy test for ‘Over The Counter’ and home use. We believe, as a Pregnancy Test Kit (PTK), that DSR is superior to the market leading digital products:

Partners: to find out more please contact us.
Our DSR technology platform can read and semi-quantify any traditional chromatography based, nitro-cellulose, lateral-flow immunoassay tests, predicated on what we believe to be a unique optical sensor arrangement.  The DSR comprises a proprietary design incorporating sensors, diagnostics, display and power management capabilities.  A key feature of our DSR technology is that its platform can be adapted and applied to numerous and disparate lateral flow diagnostic tests.
We intend to expand into related product areas including ovulation & fertility in the near future. The DSR platform can also be adapted for other immunoassay test and we are currently exploring other potential areas such as cholesterol (lifestyle testing), cardiac markers, drugs of abuse and infectious diseases e.g. HIV, syphilis, H. Plyori, Chlamydia.












Blood Coagulation Monitor | Bio-AMD















Bio-AMD




















Blood Coagulation Monitor

Patented technology currently in commercial development with a global haematology partner. Key features include:
Lab accuracy to give patient day to day control of anti-coagulant intake
                State of the art digital electronics and embedded software
                Unique blood detection design (blood and plasma)
                Very low volume whole blood sample required (‘finger-stick’)
                Fast response test result
                Temperature control with direct strip measurement
                External power supply and battery
USB connection for data output
                Internal memory
                Ease of use
Patients with cardiac problems are often on life-long oral anticoagulation therapy, for example Warfarin or Coumadin. Frequent testing and careful monitoring of the Prothrombin Time (PT)/ International Normalized Ratio (INR) or blood coagulation, to regulate the doses of anticoagulation therapy is a necessity.
However, current testing for PT/INR is both costly (to the healthcare provider since tests are normally performed in the lab) and time consuming.
                Bio-AMD is currently developing a new hand-held meter device using combined magnetic/optical detection sensors, with a unique for micro-fluidic strip using very low blood volume.
Bio-AMD’s COAG POC system is based on our disposable microfluidic strip which allows the testing of coagulation immunoassays that utilize multiple reagents.  We anticipate the newly designed strip to detect not only for the commonly tested prothrombin time (PT) / International Normalized Ratio (INR), but also other tests such as Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT).













PoC Market | Bio-AMD















Bio-AMD




















PoC Market
Delivery of healthcare is changing; the demand for rapid diagnostic testing is becoming more prevalent. The new global imperative is to speed up the diagnostic process, tailoring it more effectively to individual patients and their circumstances.
Testing at an earlier stage in the disease cycle for chronically sick patients offers clear potential to improve their quality of life by allowing self monitoring of their conditions at home or locally, rather than requiring hospital visits. In acute situations, where speed of diagnosis is critical, effective PoC testing has a crucial role to play. For example, the possibility of running an accurate and precise Troponin I assay in an ambulance on a potential heart attack patient may make a material difference to treatment and clinical outcome.
The factors driving this new approach create an opportunity for rapid diagnostic testing to play a more significant role in the patient care cycle. There is clear demand for rapid, intuitive, easy to use, robust handheld technologies that can safely take the testing environment to patients at a practical cost. Such platforms must deliver the level of sensitivity required for accurate measurements, from the smallest possible sample, and with the precision and accuracy of hospital laboratory systems.
The PoC market is growing rapidly. Forecasters suggest 10% growth per annum over the next 4-5 years making the total market worth over $22 billion. Growth rates are driven by the wider adoption of PoC technologies and new product launches. Improved accuracy and tests for a wider number of conditions will continue to see the self-test market develop rapidly. A key opportunity is for improved PoC product penetration in primary and secondary care settings.
Effective and reliable PoC technologies at the right price, such as those developed and in development by Bio-AMD can meet this need; improving care, saving costs and positively affecting clinical outcomes.
Bio-AMD has positioned itself as a leading innovator in the field of reader technology development
PoC diagnosis requires the combination of two main fields of science:
1.	 Bio-chemistry designed to detect changes in body fluid chemistry and signal a medical condition and;
2.	 Electro-mechanical engineering required to create apparatus to measure those chemical changes.
There are three elements to the successful delivery of PoC diagnosis:
1.	 The biochemistry itself; and
2.	 The medium that holds and combines the bio-chemistry with a body fluid sample; and
3.	 The device (reader) that detects the changes in the biochemistry and communicates the result to the user/patient.
The most typical format for the detection medium is a ‘smart’ strip e.g. a lateral flow strip that allows diagnostics chemistry and extracted body fluid to mix and react in a pre-determined way. Readers are typically designed to read the chemical changes on detection strips. Against this background the main trends in the PoC market are:
the development of increasingly wide ranges of complex bio-chemical detectors and markers;
the increasing sophistication of smart strips to accommodate the innovations in bio-chemistry and;
the increasing sophistication of readers, now regarded as alternatives and complements to complex laboratory equipment.
The first stage of our corporate strategy has been to develop a universal digital strip reader (DSR) capable of reading a variety of lateral flow strips to detect differing conditions. We also have in an advanced stage development a blood coagulation monitor (COAG) and a  quantitative Magnetic Immunoassay detection System (MIDS).

MIDS detection of magnetic nano-particles will allow fully quantitative measurement, rapidly producing "gold standard" results in an easy to use format, enhancing rapid screening possibilities. The device should also offer significantly better sensitivity and accuracy compared to current methods.The Report, which runs to over 70 pages, primarily focusses on our initial product development target of cardiac marker testing for myocardial infarction ("MI," heart attack). The Report was compiled in part by interview and questionnaires conducted amongst a relevant sample of medical experts and institutions in the UK, Germany and France ("Respondents"). Amongst other things, the Report indicates that;- A strong opportunity exists to service a gap in the market by the application of MIDS to cardiac marker testing; as this would significantly accelerate the triage, diagnosis, treatment and disposition of patients presenting with MI symptoms.- 96% of Respondents were likely to use a novel point of care immunoassay diagnostic platform like MIDS to detect or eliminate MI, if it were available.- 74% of Respondents agreed that a novel, rapid, more accurate point of care immunoassay such as MIDS is needed to detect or eliminate MI.- Use of MIDS would result in accelerated triage, diagnosis and treatment of MI; and free up hospital resources where MI could be eliminated.- MIDS key USPs of a rapid result time (1 -5 minutes), improved accuracy of detection and increased sensitivity, achieved Respondent attractiveness ratings of 85% or higher.- The cardiac biomarker market is predicted to reach $7.2bn p.a. by 2018, with the cardiac Point of Care Testing (“POCT”) sector expected to grow fastest at 14% to $2.4bn by 2018.- The global market for POCT generally, valued at $15.1 billion in 2013, is expected to increase to $19.3bn in 2018.- In the UK alone, the introduction of MIDS for cardiac marker testing could potentially save the UK National Health Service around £200million ($300million) per year.- MIDS also has a powerful opportunity to address other POCT applications such as for Venous Thromboembolic, Sepsis and Stroke conditions, and for infectious disease and cancer.The Company is very much encouraged by this independent validation and estimated quantification of the large potential market for MIDS based devices applied to cardiac markers.Tom Barr, CEO, commented, "As our first technologies move towards market, this report into the outlook for MIDS shows where additional value may be created. There is a huge unmet demand for a product such as MIDS. We believe we can deliver the huge advantages of such Point of Care testing at the right price and look forward to engaging with interested parties as we move into development."About Bio-AMD, Inc.Bio-AMD has two majority owned UK subsidiaries: Bio-AMD Limited, a technology developer for medical diagnostic devices; and WOCU Ltd, the owner of the WOCU(R), a global currency data reference source for application in financial markets.

					Full Description



Bio-AMD, Inc., incorporated on March 10, 2006, is engaged in developing its Point Of Care (POC) medical diagnostic device business, and commercializing its WOCU-based currency risk mitigation business. The Company operates through two segments: the development of a technology designed to mitigate currency risk through its subsidiary, WOCU Limited (WL), and the development of hand held, electronic medical diagnostic devices capable of reading third-party assays through its other subsidiary, Bio-AMD Holdings Limited.The Company offers a disposable micro-fluidic test strip, which is used to measure prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) through a POC blood coagulation monitoring device (COAG) enabling patient-based, anticoagulant drug therapy monitoring. The Company also offers a Digital Strip Reader (DSR), which enables to read a range of lateral flow-based immunoassay diagnostic test strips already in the POC market, including cardiac markers, infectious diseases, drugs of abuse and female wellbeing (pregnancy/ovulation testing), to provide semi-quantitative results, and a disposable test strip combining micro-fluidics and lab-on-chip technology providing quantitative measurement into a sensitive immunoassay POC platform that detects nanoparticles through magnetic manipulation using a magnetic and optical double detection technique known as Magnetic Immunoassay Detection System (MIDS).The DSR technology platform utilizes a method for reading and quantifying traditional chromatography-based, nitro-cellulose, lateral-flow immunoassay tests. The DSR comprises a design incorporating sensors, diagnostics, display and power management capabilities. The WOCU is a foreign exchange derivative quotation computed by its algorithm, a weighted currency basket encompassing the exchange rates of the fiat (national) currencies of various economies, weighted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Gross Domestic Product figures of those individual countries and outputted in real time. The WOCU quotation is available from WL as daily and hourly fixed reference prices for approximately 169 fiat currencies, digital currencies and commoditiesThe WOCU quotation is available from WL's re-seller Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) via its data terminals and data feeds under the ticker symbol XCU. IDC calculates and offers quotations for approximately 47 WOCU-based currency pairs and approximately six commodities, as cross rates and supplies a standalone WOCU real-time charting package application via IDC's PrimePortal application. WOCU rates are also available on the professional Thompson Reuters platform and on the United Kingdom-based retail price data platform, ADVFN. The WOCU quotation is also available via a mobile application for Apple mobile devices known as WOCU, which supports approximately five languages, including English, simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean. The WOCU quotation is also available as an hourly reference price available directly from WL by really simple syndication (RSS) feed, e-mail and via WL's file transfer protocol (FTP) server. The WOCU quotation as an hourly updated price is also available from the Company's corporate Website www.wocu.com.

Digital Strip Reader

The first stage of our corporate strategy has been to develop a universal digital strip reader (DSR). Key features include:
Unique interlocked cartridge cap
Unique Quad Solar Cell light sensor array
Clear digital LCD output to minimise errors
Environmentally friendly – No batteries or chemicals (fully disposable)
High sensitivity (semi-quantitative measurement)
Tolerance free system
Low manufacturing cost (higher profit margin)
Ability to read any lateral flow strip including those using colour change
Ease of use
To see the DSR in action go here: DSR movie.
The DSR has a wide range of applications. We have focused our commercial efforts initially on a next generation pregnancy test for ‘Over The Counter’ and home use. We believe, as a Pregnancy Test Kit (PTK), that DSR is superior to the market leading digital products:

Partners: to find out more please contact us.
Our DSR technology platform can read and semi-quantify any traditional chromatography based, nitro-cellulose, lateral-flow immunoassay tests, predicated on what we believe to be a unique optical sensor arrangement.  The DSR comprises a proprietary design incorporating sensors, diagnostics, display and power management capabilities.  A key feature of our DSR technology is that its platform can be adapted and applied to numerous and disparate lateral flow diagnostic tests.
We intend to expand into related product areas including ovulation & fertility in the near future. The DSR platform can also be adapted for other immunoassay test and we are currently exploring other potential areas such as cholesterol (lifestyle testing), cardiac markers, drugs of abuse and infectious diseases e.g. HIV, syphilis, H. Plyori, Chlamydia.

 Bio-AMD, Inc.; Patent Application for Cartridge Test Cap

 Comments 
 by The Associated Press  

 



Bio-AMD, Inc. is pleased to  announce that Bio AMD Limited, our majority owned medical devices  subsidiary ("Bio-AMD", "We" or the "Company" OTCBB: BIAD.OB, OTCQB:  BIAD) has submitted a UK Intellectual Property Office patent  application for a replaceable Cartridge Test Cap ("Cap") component  used in its Digital Strip Reader ("DSR") device. Competitive devices, particularly in pregnancy and ovulation testing  applications, typically require a sample to be applied to a test strip  unit prior to insertion into a disposable battery powered digital  reader. This method can introduce contamination errors inaccuracies  and false positives due to delay in reading the activated test strip,  and generates battery life and recycling issues. Bio-AMD's Cap is a replaceable, disposable unit. The Cap comprises a  cartridge mounted test strip with an interlocked test strip cover that  can only be removed after the Cap is engaged with the DSR. Engagement  of the Cap automatically powers up the DSR and allows removal of the  Cap cover. This permits a sample to be immediately read without any  further procedural step, minimising contamination potential and false  positives. Numerous disposable Caps can be read by a single solar  powered DSR device, reducing test costs and eliminating battery  shelf-life and disposal problems. About DSR The DSR technology is a patented method of reading and  quantifying traditional chromatography based, lateral-flow  immunoassays including pregnancy and fertility testing, cardiac  markers, infectious diseases and drug testing.  Compared to existing  analog tests DSR offers increased sensitivity and semi-quantitative  measurement, allowing earlier diagnostic testing with improved  accuracy. The DSR hand-held reader device incorporates portability, scalability  and repeatability with low manufacturing costs. Our technology also  runs on photo-electric power, avoiding the need for chemical batteries  and the disposal issues arising from them. About Bio-AMD, Inc. Bio-AMD has two majority owned UK subsidiaries:  Bio AMD Limited, a technology developer for medical diagnostic  devices; and the WDX Organisation Ltd, the owner of the WOCU@, a  global currency data reference source for application in financial  markets.
