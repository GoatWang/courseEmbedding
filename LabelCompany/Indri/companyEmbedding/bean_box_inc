Testimonials















Cabin and cottage ceilings look dramatic with exposed wood beams, but achieving this look can be pricey. The heft of solid wood beams can also cause structural issues if they're not supported adequately. Alternatively, consider there three-sided box beams made from reclaimed wood. They're hollow inside, so they can be used to wrap existing steel supports or hide electrical wires.

                Cabin Life Magazine





My wife and I, both of which are in our sixties, stained and installed the beams on our 12' high ceiling.We have received many compliments about the beams. The only time I tell people they are faux beams is when they ask how we got them up on the ceiling. 

                Bob
                Del Monte, AZ





We are very happy with the beautiful, natural driftwood faux wood beams installed in our living room. The grain, color, sheen are all natural and subtle; they look very authentic. Customer service was helpful in sending a variety of samples, determining the size to order, and tracking the progress. Our contractor found them easy to install. They've transformed our room!

                Jennifer

“The order came very well packed and arrived without damage to the contents.  It would be nice to have local distribution to forego some of the shipping time restraints and cost, but for what its worth, it is the right product for our projects.”

Good News Spreads Fast.
See what our customers have to say about Bean Box.







Video segment on Bean Box. Series on treating yourself and subscription boxes.


– King5









"Single origin coffee from an all-local roster of roasters, including Herkimer and Kuma...."


– Eater









"The Bean Box team is banking on Seattle’s well-established reputation as a coffee mecca, with a pitch that underscores locality and freshness."


– Daily Coffee News









"The freshness of Bean Box’s coffees is hard to match. The quick delivery ensures that all the nuances and flavors that the roasters intended get to the consumer while they’re still at their peak."


– Playboy









"You know it’s fresh when there’s a large bloom. With the coffee from Bean Box, the bloom was extraordinary. And that, to me, seems like the advantage of a place like Bean Box."


– The Boston Globe









"What else makes Bean Box different from other subscription coffee services? Freshness."


– Seattle Weekly









"Our two key advantages over competition in the space are that we are focused on Seattle roasters—the most active specialty roasting market in the U.S.—and fresh delivery."


– Startup Beat









"Differentiates itself from others mainly with the company’s proximity to so many premium roasters that are apart of what he calls 'an incredibly tight-knit community' who want to expand their base beyond Seattle and the Pacific Northwest."


– GeekWire









Video Review of Bean Box by Jason Coffee


– Coffee Cup News









"Think of it as an ongoing coffee tour of the city, without having to buy plane tickets. It’s a great idea."


– Coffee Detective









"Have you ever wished you could have the absolute best coffees from America’s best known coffee city of Seattle without traveling all the way to Washington just to get it? Lucky for you a couple of local entrepreneurial guys... felt the same way."


– Coffee Cup News

Made it in a Chemex, drank it pretty much every day. It was really good coffee, super light roast, which I don't often buy. Can't wait for the next bag!"

I've had a monthly subscription for more than a year now and it's my favorite subscription I've ever had, I love it! Being able to try so many different kinds of coffee has been amazing. The boxes are packaged nicely and I love the treats I find inside. Keep up the wonderful work, Bean Box! "

Donna 

on January 23, 2017


I love Bean Box! It is one of the best purchases I make every month. One thing that I respect most is the diversity of the small roasters that are offered and that I (in a very small way) can help these small companies be successful. Thank you!!"

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

Testimonials















Cabin and cottage ceilings look dramatic with exposed wood beams, but achieving this look can be pricey. The heft of solid wood beams can also cause structural issues if they're not supported adequately. Alternatively, consider there three-sided box beams made from reclaimed wood. They're hollow inside, so they can be used to wrap existing steel supports or hide electrical wires.

                Cabin Life Magazine





My wife and I, both of which are in our sixties, stained and installed the beams on our 12' high ceiling.We have received many compliments about the beams. The only time I tell people they are faux beams is when they ask how we got them up on the ceiling. 

                Bob
                Del Monte, AZ





We are very happy with the beautiful, natural driftwood faux wood beams installed in our living room. The grain, color, sheen are all natural and subtle; they look very authentic. Customer service was helpful in sending a variety of samples, determining the size to order, and tracking the progress. Our contractor found them easy to install. They've transformed our room!

                Jennifer

My wife is from Seattle, but sadly, we live in Texas. I gave this to her as a gift for her birthday, she is so happy reading about where each coffee is from and has mentioned often she feels back home with ever sip! Thank you for making our month, every month!"

I really enjoyed receiving my sample pack from Bean Box. Each pack was perfect for two cups of coffee (pour over style). Each different pack of beans was delicious and unique! Thank you Bean Box!"

I was given a mixed box of the Beans and they are delicious. I love fresh bean, and good coffee. I still have two in the box I have not tried."

Made it in a Chemex, drank it pretty much every day. It was really good coffee, super light roast, which I don't often buy. Can't wait for the next bag!"

I've had a monthly subscription for more than a year now and it's my favorite subscription I've ever had, I love it! Being able to try so many different kinds of coffee has been amazing. The boxes are packaged nicely and I love the treats I find inside. Keep up the wonderful work, Bean Box! "

I love Bean Box! It is one of the best purchases I make every month. One thing that I respect most is the diversity of the small roasters that are offered and that I (in a very small way) can help these small companies be successful. Thank you!!"

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
