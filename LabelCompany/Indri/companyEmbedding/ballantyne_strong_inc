Ballantyne Strong, Inc. Showcases Diverse Product Offering for Pro-AV Dealers at InfoComm | Business Wire


























































      Ballantyne Strong, Inc. Showcases Diverse Product Offering for Pro-AV 
      Dealers at InfoComm
    



      Full spectrum of solutions for lighting, screens and digital signage 
      will be on display at the Technologies for Worship Pavilion
    





InfoComm 2014


June 17, 2014 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ballantyne Strong, Inc. (NYSE: BTN), a diversified provider of digital 
      technology services, products and solutions, announced a comprehensive 
      product lineup for pro-AV dealers and integrators that includes 
      projection screens, digital signage and lighting solutions. The full 
      array of products will be on display at InfoComm 2014, the largest 
      annual conference and exhibition for AV buyers and sellers worldwide, 
      and can be viewed in the Technologies for Worship Pavilion and in the 
      Ballantyne Strong Booth, C5251 from June 18-20, 2014.
    

      Traditionally known for its sophisticated giant screens, Ballantyne 
      Strong is entering the pro-AV market with a robust, high quality screen 
      offering for smaller installations. The company is leveraging the 
      expertise of its Strong/MDI subsidiary to develop screens systems that 
      will be sold exclusively through the pro-AV channel. Dealers and 
      integrators are invited to take advantage of Strong/MDI’s InfoComm 
      Promotion for a 10% rebate on initial purchases of any screen from the 
      Monarch or Integrated Cyber Series.
    

      Dealers can trust Strong/MDI for its consistent high quality screens, 
      personalized customer care and incredibly fast delivery. The company has 
      a team of mechanical designers and engineers who can design and build 
      custom projects of any shape or size. It offers a full line of products 
      ranging from large size structures and sophisticated front- and 
      rear-view screens to small framed and motorized screen systems. 
      Strong/MDI is recognized as an innovator in projection screen 
      manufacturing and offers the most advanced screen coatings and 
      projection screen technology available in the world. With decades of 
      experience manufacturing cinema screens and custom projects of all 
      sizes, Strong/MDI brings the world-class quality associated with premier 
      theater venues to the pro-AV market.
    

      In addition, the company is launching a formalized partner program to 
      expand its SpinetiX digital signage offering. The partner program 
      features tiered levels to support high volume dealers to those just 
      entering the digital signage market. Through its subsidiary, Convergent 
      Media Systems, the program offers volume discounts, deal registration, 
      lead generation, sales assistance, marketing resources and technical 
      support. The program was announced today at its annual Digital Signage 
      Academy, which achieved record attendance from dealers and integrators 
      from around the world. Convergent is the exclusive distributor of 
      SpinetiX technologies for North America.
    

      The SpinetiX digital signage platform offers a robust feature set that 
      supports a wide range of applications. Thanks to its simple user 
      interface and quick set up, SpinetiX makes it easy to create and manage 
      great looking content in no time. It features Hyper Media Players (HMP 
      130 and HMP200) and Elementi software. Its intuitive user interface 
      makes it easy to manage content across many locations, or across many 
      players in a campus environment.
    

      The company is looking to expand its dealer and integrator base to 
      support its growing lighting business. Strong Lighting is the exclusive 
      distributor of D.T.S. lighting solutions, and is responsible for 
      illuminating some of the most recognized venues and events in the world. 
      D.T.S. features the latest generation of lighting technologies that are 
      super-bright, ultra-light, versatile and cost effective.
    

      As the exclusive sponsor of screens, digital signage and lighting for 
      the Technologies for Worship pavilion, Ballantyne Strong will light the 
      stage with 32 spot and motion lights. It will also feature a large 
      16-foot projection screen on the main stage and smaller screen systems 
      in two workshop areas. The pavilion will also feature several digital 
      signage displays that will show the schedule of events throughout the 
      trade show.
    

      Members of the Ballantyne Strong team will also lead a number of 
      hands-on workshops in the pavilion. T.D. Mangrum, director of lighting, 
      will discuss church lighting applications, trends, and creating greater 
      impact in worship venues through lighting. His “Message of Light” 
      workshop is Wednesday, June 18 and Thursday, June 19 at 11:00 am. 
      Patrick Bouchard, senior account manager for Strong/MDI Screen Systems, 
      will review choices in screen systems for churches. His workshop is 
      Wednesday, June 18 at 1:00 pm. Kris Konrath, director of marketing, will 
      review how digital signage can enhance church member experience and 
      interaction. This workshop is Thursday, June 19 at 12:00 pm.

Ballantyne Strong Regains Compliance With NYSE MKT Listing Requirements
May 30 17
Ballantyne Strong, Inc. made an announcement about compliance with NYSE MKT listing requirements. As previously reported on May 22, 2017, the Company had received a letter from the NYSE MKT stock exchange on May 18, 2017, indicating that the Company was not in compliance with NYSE MKT’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria outlined in Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. The Company had been unable to timely file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, pending completion of a review and restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. On May 24, 2017, the Company filed its amended annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2016 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. On May 25, 2017, the Company received a letter from the NYSE MKT stock exchange that it is back in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT Company Guide.


Ballantyne Strong Receives Non-Compliance Notice From NYSE MKT
May 22 17
Ballantyne Strong, Inc. made an announcement about non-compliance with NYSE MKT listing requirements. For the reasons previously disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K, dated May 11, 2017 (8-K), and in its Form 12b-25, dated May 11, 2017 (12b-25 and, together with the 8-K, the Prior Filings), Ballantyne Strong, Inc. (Company) has not timely filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Form 10-Q), pending the completion of a review and restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. As disclosed in the Prior Filings, the Company, in consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP, has been working diligently to complete the steps necessary in order to file its Form 10-Q as soon as practicable.  As a result of the delayed Form 10-Q filing, the Company received a letter from the NYSE MKT stock exchange on May 18, 2017, indicating that the Company is not in compliance with NYSE MKT’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria outlined in Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. The letter states that the Company must submit a plan by June 19, 2017 advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by November 20, 2017, and if the Company fails to submit a plan or the plan is not accepted, delisting proceedings will commence. The letter states that if the Company fails to regain compliance with the NYSE MKT rules prior to the compliance deadline, or fails to make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, NYSE MKT staff will immediately reassess the Company’s continued listing. The Company can regain compliance with the NYSE MKT listing standards at any time through November 20, 2017 by filing its Form 10-Q with the SEC. As previously disclosed, the Company intends to file the Form 10-Q promptly after the restatement is complete. Upon making such filing, the Company expects to again be in compliance with the continued listing requirements of NYSE MKT.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
