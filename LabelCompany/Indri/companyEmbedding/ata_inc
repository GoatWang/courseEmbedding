We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $39.2 million, or approximately $45.7 million if the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us.

      As of the date of this prospectus, we anticipate using the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

•  approximately $2 million to develop and expand our test preparation solutions
   business;                                                  
    
•  approximately $2 million to license course content from IT vendors to expand 
   our degree major and single course program offerings;         
    
•  approximately $1 million for marketing costs related to enhancing our “ATA” 
   brand; and                                                     
    
•  the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes,
   including incremental costs associated with being a public company, and for 
   acquisitions of or investments in other businesses, products or technologies
   that we believe are complementary to our own business or that otherwise 
   extend our business or brand. We do not currently have any agreements or 
   understandings to make any material acquisitions of, or investments in, other 
   businesses.                

      The industries in which we operate are evolving rapidly which could cause
significant and rapid changes to our strategies and business plans. The
foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering based upon our present plans
and business conditions, but our management will have broad flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds from this offering. The occurrence of
new business opportunities, unforeseen events or changed business conditions may
result in application of the proceeds from this offering in a manner other than
as described in this prospectus.

      To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive
from this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend
to invest our net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, debt securities or
to deposit the proceeds into interest-bearing bank accounts. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a PFIC for
U.S. federal income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax consequences
to you.


In relation to computer-based testing services, we compete with domestic
Chinese testing software providers and international computer-based testing
service providers. Prometric and Pearson VUE are our main competitors in China.
We compete with them primarily based on technology, price, management experience
and established infrastructure. We believe our overall testing services and
technologies compare favorably with the services and technologies offered by
these competitors. Moreover, we believe that our nationwide test center network
and test delivery platform provides us with a significant competitive advantage
over these two competitors. We believe we are currently the market leader in
computer-based testing services in China due to the combination of our
experience in and familiarity with the China computer-based testing services 
market, our advanced technology, our large nationwide network of test centers, 
our established relationships with key test sponsors and governmental agencies 
and our competitive cost levels.

      In relation to our career-oriented educational services, we face
competition from international companies, such as Aptech Limited and NIIT
Limited. Aptech Limited operates in China primarily through its joint venture
with BeiDa Jade Bird. Although these two companies offer IT-related courses to
post-secondary educational institutions in China, based on our market experience
and client communications we believe they do not directly compete with our
products and services. For example, these two companies design their own course
content and exams and provide passing students with their own proprietary
certifications, rather than offering course content and certifications designed
by well-known IT vendors, as we do. Other than the joint venture between Aptech
Limited and BeiDa Jade Bird, we are not aware of any domestic Chinese company
that offers educational services similar to or competitive with our
career-oriented educational services. As a result, we have to date experienced
little pricing pressure due to competition, although we do feel some pressure to
maintain a pricing level for our educational services that is affordable for
vocational schools that ultimately need to pass such costs on to students in the
form of tuition and course fees. This may prevent us from raising prices for our
education services significantly in the short term.

      Traditional Chinese test preparation material providers, such as
publishing companies, indirectly compete with our test preparation solutions.
However, we are not aware of any significant competitors in China in the online
test preparation solutions business. In relation to our simulation technologies,
there are a few U.S.-based companies providing performance-based testing
technologies, including Certiport, Inc. We are aware of only a handful of other
simulation testing technology developers, which primarily focus on the training
and test preparation business market in the United States. We believe, based on
communications with our clients and others in the industry, that our simulation
testing technology compares favorably to those offered by other companies and in
other countries, including the United States.

      While we anticipate new market entrants and increased efforts by existing
international players to expand their presence in China, we believe that
relatively high entry barriers, such as the time and costs associated with
establishing a large-scale test center network and developing course and test
content for educational programs, will make it difficult for new entrants or
international competitors to quickly gain market share from us in China. We
believe potential domestic entrants lack the technology and commercial
relationships that we have already developed with domestic and international
test sponsors. International competitors will likely face challenges in
establishing effective relationships with key Chinese government and industry
test sponsors or local educational institutions.


Company Description
We are the leading provider of computer-based testing services in China,
with the largest market share, 30.9%, in terms of revenue in 2006, according to
IDC. We also provide career-oriented test-based educational programs and test
preparation solutions. To comply with PRC law, we operate the online


 portion of
our test preparation solutions business through a series of contractual
arrangements with ATA Online (Beijing) Education Technology Limited, or ATA
Online, a PRC entity owned by two of our founders and over which we do not have
direct control or direct oversight. We have experienced significant growth in
our business during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Our total net revenues
have increased from RMB69.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 to
RMB84.9 million ($11.3 million) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, and
from RMB32.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2006 to
RMB76.2 million ($10.2 million) for the six months ended September 30, 2007. We
had net losses of RMB24.8 million and RMB16.8 million for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, and net income of RMB8.5 million
($1.1 million) for the six months ended September 30, 2007.

      We started our business in 1999 focusing on providing computer-based
testing services to test sponsors. Our revenues from the licensing of testing
services, which we provide to test sponsors, have grown primarily as a result of
increases in the number of test takers who take tests created and delivered
using our testing technologies as well as our ability to secure increasing
numbers of new contracts from test sponsors for the creation and delivery of new
computer-based test titles. Testing services revenues accounted for 32.8% and
38.7% of our total net revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2006 and
2007, respectively. In the near term, we expect our testing services revenues to
continue to be the largest source of our total net revenues as a result of new
contracts with test sponsors in the banking, securities and insurance sectors.
Our testing services are also important for reasons other than the revenues they
generate. The expertise we have developed in the creation and delivery of large
scale tests covering a wide variety of test topics and industries contributes to
our ability to create and offer career-oriented course programs and test
preparation solutions.
