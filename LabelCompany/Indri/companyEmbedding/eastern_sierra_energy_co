About Us
Sierra Solar has provided renewable energy solutions to the Eastern Sierra and California for more than 22 years.  Sierra Solar was started in 1990 by Jim Harper, a general contractor and backcountry skier who specialized in remote site construction projects.  A pioneer in the solar industry, Harper was one of the first graduates of Solar Energy International's solar training programs in 1991.  Harper's training at SEI and his many years of hands-on experience with off-grid and grid-tie photovoltaics and solar thermal systems have given him the knowledge and expertise necessary to be recognized as an expert in the renewable energy industry. 
Over the years, Sierra Solar has established itself as one of the leading off-grid and grid-tie companies in the Sierra. In 2006 TJ Chase joined the Sierra Solar team. TJ brings a very diverse resume of practical business and trade experience and a passion for renewable energy to the table. As owner and lead installer TJ is in the field everyday working hands on with our customers, handling everything from sales and system design to installation and system commissioning.
Today Harper and Chase, along with their highly qualified staff, are setting the standard for renewable energy systems.  With over 100 projects to their credit and nearly 1 million watts of residential power installed, Sierra Solar strives to be the leading alternative energy business in the Eastern Sierra.
Sierra Solar is a full service company who will handle every aspect of the job, from site analysis and system design to application and permit processing to the final installation. Sierra Solar is a fully licensed and bonded General Contractor, c-10 Electrical Contractor and c-46 Solar Contractor. By having these licenses we are able to handle every aspect of the job, from start to finish and we are dedicated to serving our customers needs. We don't subcontract our Labor!
Sierra Solar's goal is 100% customer satisfaction.

                            ESEI Partnership Kick-off Meeting			


Eastern Sierra Energy Initiative 

A Multi-Agency Local Energy Partnership encompassing the Town of Mammoth Lakes, City of Bishop and Inyo and Mono Counties.
ESEI represents an expansion of the successful partnership in Mammoth Lakes – the High Sierra Energy Initiative. This initiative is a rurally oriented partnership covering over 13,000 square miles and serving a total population of about 25,000.
ESEI’s scope and objective is to reduce energy use and demand by focusing on three key areas: Establishing a “culture” of energy efficiency, working closely with Southern California Edison to more effectively implement existing programs, and seeking innovative approaches to energy efficiency in our alpine environment
We continue to build on the success of our loca government partnership highlighting several regional energy efficiency accomplishments. Eastern Sierra Energy Initiative has championed energy efficiency activities, including:

SCE Direct Install Program for Small Businesses
With the assistance of the Partnership, Eastern Sierra Energy Initiative ranked 26th of the 379 communities participating in the Direct Install Program with an average capture rate of 89% and savings totaled just over 1.5 million kWh and 164 kW and just Mammoth Lakes capture rate was 98%. SCE contractors signed up 478 customers and 404 have been constructed with a total of $601,112 spent from Bishop to Bridgeport.
With the success of the Direct Install program in 2011, the program was brought back in 2014.
With the assistance of the Partnership, installations were completed in December 2014 for the Non Residential Direct Install (NRDI) program. The following totals include lighting, refrigeration and window film installation:Total businesses – 199, total construction amount - $411,612.01• Mammoth Lakes – 114 businesses, $250,603.33• Lee Vining – 6 businesses, $5,827.74• June Lake – 19 businesses, $37,683.34• Crowley Lake – 4 businesses, $10,779.44• Bridgeport – 21 businesses, $66,083.77• Bishop – 35 businesses, $40,634.3
