Investment Approach








                We invest long and short across six different asset groups: stocks of major developed markets, country indices, bond futures, interest rate futures, currencies and commodities. We employ market-neutral, long-short strategies across these asset groups based on four investment styles: 
 
Value — the tendency for relatively cheap assets to outperform relatively expensive ones

Momentum — the tendency for an asset’s recent relative performance to continue in the future

Carry — the tendency for higher-yielding assets to provide higher returns than lower-yielding assets

Defensive — the tendency for lower-risk and higher-quality assets to generate higher risk-adjusted returns

Each of these styles have historically had low correlations to one another, so we expect them to be profitable at different times for different reasons. Thus, a portfolio combining all four of them seeks to benefit from their expected low correlations to one another and could help provide a more robust, dependable stream of returns.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

An investment in any of the AQR Funds involves risk, including loss of principal. The value of the Funds’ portfolio holdings may fluctuate in response to events specific to the companies in which the Fund invests, as well as economic, political or social events in the United States or abroad. Please refer to the prospectus for complete information regarding all risks associated with the Funds. An investor considering the Funds should be able to tolerate potentially wide price fluctuations.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

Defensive Style Funds, Momentum Style Funds, Multi-Style Funds, International Equity Fund, Global Equity Fund and Relaxed Constraint Equity Funds: January 28, 2018

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

Defensive Style Funds, Momentum Style Funds, Multi-Style Funds, International Equity Fund, Global Equity Fund and Relaxed Constraint Equity Funds: January 28, 2018




60/40 Portfolio benchmark consists of 60% S&P 500 Index / 40% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market value weighted index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity, and industry grouping, and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based index used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States.

All Fund Statistics are subject to change.  Portfolio holdings are subject to change and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell securities.


Risk allocation is calculated as the relative weight of the expected volatilities for each asset class or strategy, with a sum equal to 100%. AQR calculates expected volatilities for each strategy using proprietary risk models to predict volatilities and correlations across all assets in the portfolio.

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies  and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses.

All Fund Statistics are subject to change.  Portfolio holdings are subject to change and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell securities.


Risk allocation is calculated as the relative weight of the expected volatilities for each asset class or strategy, with a sum equal to 100%. AQR calculates expected volatilities for each strategy using proprietary risk models to predict volatilities and correlations across all assets in the portfolio.


AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Style Premia Trust



Fact Sheet












Overview








Investment Objective
                                The AQR Style Premia Trust (“the Fund”) seeks to produce positive risk-adjusted returns, while targeting a low correlation to traditional markets, through applying a systematic investment process to four well known Investment Styles: Value, Momentum, Carry and Defensive. To pursue its investment objective, the Fund will implement each of the Investment Styles to invest globally, both long and short, across the following asset groups: equities, fixed income and currencies. A “long” position will benefit from an increase in price of the asset, while a “short” position will benefit from a decrease in price of the asset.
                                
Investment Approach
AQR has identified four investment strategies that, based on its research, have delivered positive long-term returns with low correlation to each other, across a multitude of asset classes, markets, and time periods. These four investment strategies AQR refers to as the “Investment Styles” (Value, Momentum, Carry, and Defensive).


Value — the tendency for relatively cheap assets to outperform relatively expensive ones

Momentum — the tendency for an asset’s recent relative performance to continue in the future

Carry — the tendency for higher-yielding assets to provide higher returns than lower-yielding assets

Defensive — the tendency for lower-risk and higher-quality assets to generate higher risk-adjusted returns

AQR Launches Style Premia Alternative Fund


















AQR Launches Style Premia Alternative Fund


November 07, 2013





GREENWICH, Connecticut, November 7, 2013 — AQR Capital Management, LLC, (“AQR”) announced today the introduction of a mutual fund that seeks to give financial advisors access to systematic investment styles that, based on empirical research, have generated long-term positive returns in a wide cross section of asset classes. 
The AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund (Class I: QSPIX) employs four styles: Value, Momentum, Carry and Defensive. Value means buying assets that are “cheap” relative to their fundamental value and selling “expensive” assets. Momentum involves buying assets that recently outperformed their peers and selling those that recently underperformed. Carry implies buying high-yielding and selling low-yielding assets. Defensive consists of buying low-risk, high-quality assets and selling high-risk, low-quality assets. 
Each of these styles is backed by decades of research and rigorous analysis. Until now, they have been used mainly by large institutional investors in a long-only manner. The AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund uses these four styles to invest both long and short in several asset group, hedging out risks of any one asset class with the goal of remaining market neutral. The fund seeks to isolate returns from styles alone and thus increase diversification potential. 
The fund began operation on November 1, 2013, and is distributed through financial advisors only. 
“These investment styles have delivered positive long-term returns with low correlation across a multitude of asset classes, using liquid securities,” said David G. Kabiller, CFA, Co-Founding Principal and Head of Client Strategies at AQR. “We think the Style Premia Alternative Fund provides investors with a strategic way to gain exposure to a diversifying stream of potential returns.” 
Because each style seeks to generate returns that are independent of the others, they have historically had low correlations to one other. This suggests they are likely to be profitable at different times for different reasons, so a portfolio combining all four could help provide a more-robust and diversified stream of returns. In addition, we have seen these styles, as a portfolio, exhibit consistent returns in various economic environments. 
“Given today’s market valuations, we believe investors’ portfolios are even more dominated by equity risk and may be well-served by these uncorrelated return sources,” Kabiller added. 
AQR Capital Management launched its first mutual fund on January 9, 2009. Its AQR Funds unit has grown to approximately $13.2 billion as of September 30, 2013, reflecting its expertise in the development of long-only equity and diversifying alternative investment strategies. AQR’s total assets under management were approximately $90.2 billion as of September 30, 2013 (includes assets managed by CNH Partners, LLC, an affiliate).

Disclosures 
This Fund is not suitable for all investors. An investor considering the Funds should be able to tolerate potentially wide price fluctuations. The Fund may attempt to increase its income or total return through the use of securities lending, and may be subject to the possibility of additional loss as a result of this investment technique. The Fund is new and has a limited operating history. 
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of losses. There are risks involved with investing including the possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 
Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. Funds that emphasize investments in smaller companies generally will experience greater price volatility. Please refer to the prospectus for complete information regarding all risks associated with the Funds. 
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 1-866-290-2688 or visit https://funds.aqr.com/ to view or download a prospectus online. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. 
As per the prospectus, the investment objective of the AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund is long-term capital appreciation.

Definition 


CORRELATION: A statistical measure of how variables — such as securities prices, interest rates or volatilities — move in relation to each other. Perfect positive correlation (a correlation coefficient of +1) implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security will move in the same direction. Perfect negative correlation (a correlation coefficient of –1) means that if one security moves in either direction the security the other security will move in the opposite direction. If the correlation is 0, the movements of the securities are said to have no correlation; they are completely random.
