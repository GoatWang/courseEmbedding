We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. Check it out.








Beautiful natural soaps that smell good too!

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.








Dryest pancakes I've ever had.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

Back to Gallery
















As a gourmet grocery market loaded with organic, non-genetically modified and other natural foods, Living Foods in Kauai’s upscale, plantation-style Shops at Kukuiula may remind some patrons of Whole Foods, just with wooden floors and even fresher papayas.
For co-owners Jeff Sacchini and Howard Warner, who moved from Northern California to Kauai a year ago after buying the store from former San Francisco chef Jim Moffat, another comparison may be more apt.
“I think Living Foods is unique in and of itself, but I would liken it to Bi-Rite in San Francisco,” said Sacchini, a former executive with Fresh Point, the country’s largest produce distributor. “They don’t have the kitchen that we do, but in terms of the quality focus and the integrity, they do. Nothing comes through our back door unless it’s a real high-integrity product.”
“Bi-Rite is just out of this world,” agreed Warner, brother of Sacchini’s wife, Liz, and formerly a corporate lawyer who lived in San Francisco and later Orinda. “That type of store is able to get into the community more deeply, and we’re small enough that we can get closer to the consumer than Whole Foods.”

At Living Foods, those consumers are about 70 percent visitors and 30 percent locals, according to Sacchini. Tourists often discover the grocery market by dining in one of the several Shops at Kukuiula restaurants run by Hawaii celebrity chefs, including Roy Yamaguchi’s new Eating House 1849, opened last month.
“I loved the concept of having a really high-end gourmet market, focused on mostly organic, non-GMO foods, but with a high-end kitchen,” said Sacchini. A half dozen of the store’s chefs, bakers and line cooks have culinary training, he noted, including the head baker, a Culinary Institute of America grad who moved to Kauai for its premier scuba diving.
“We’re really proud of our bakery’s scones, Danishes and muffins,” Sacchini said. “Our flour is made in South San Francisco at Giusto’s, and I won’t compromise on that, because it’s regarded as the best flour in the world.”
The store also serves 18 prepared salads daily, including farm-raised organic chicken curry with house-made chutney, locally grown kale, and local red and gold beets. They come from a rotating list of 38 salads, but “people let us know their frustration if we don’t have the kale, the chicken or the beets every day,” Sacchini said.
The Garden Isle’s naturally grown fruits and vegetables are also part of the store’s appeal. Not all are certified organic, though for good reasons, Sacchini said.
“Most are from mom-and-pop type farms, where they don’t have the money to get organic certification,” he explained. “I’ve toured almost all of the farms, and they are passionate about high-quality products. We have a gal who grows Sugarloaf pineapple for us in Moloaa, and she treats them as if they were her own children.”

                        "ISLAND FISHING KAUAI"                                         Captain  Jeff Brown




Captain Jeff Island Fishing Deep Sea Charters Kauai Hawaii

Aloha, I'm Captain Jeff Brown, owner and operator of Island Fishing Kauai.  Pictured here with my wife Jig, and my beautiful daughter Emma and Son Elijah as seen in the photo's below. I'm originally from Santa Barbara California  where at an early age  I developed a real passion for fishing . Having spent my childhood in and around the water both as a surfer and a fisherman, it was  a natural progression for me to eventually become a boat captain and an accomplished fisherman. I spent many years working  on sport and commercial dive boats off the Santa Barbara Channel Islands before relocating to Kauai in 1992. Upon arrival to Hawaii I wasted no time in pursuing the amazing opportunities Kauai provides for Big game sport fishing. I started out working as a deck hand for one of the top Charter outfits on Kauai and a Captain who was featured in Saltwater Angling Guides for his expertise in rigging and techniques. I also had the privilege of working alongside one of Kauai's top commercial fishermen. Today I hold my own Federal issued Captains license and enjoy nothing more than sharing what I have learned with visitors to the Island. At Island Fishing Kauai, we pride ourselves in making our clients safety and comfort a priority and providing a Kauai fishing experience that will last a lifetime.Welcome Aboard,Captain Jeff Brown

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. Check it out.








Beautiful natural soaps that smell good too!

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.








Dryest pancakes I've ever had.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.

WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.








They hand cut bacon... never again.

Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving? We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. No Aloha attitude here.RIP OFF ALERT! I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14! What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.

Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!

If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. Check it out.

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Amazing breakfast sandwich, burrito and pancakes! I could eat here every morning. Great place to eat or grab a snack







I work in the mall and this is one of my favorite places to go for lunch when I'm in the mood to splurge. Their pizzas are amazing! I usually get the Milano or if I'm in the mood for something healthy I'll get the Ahi Salad. My coworkers and I also like to go there for breakfast from time to time, because it tastes good and they give pretty big portions. It's a little pricey but that's to be expected in the Poipu area. Although for the price you're getting a great meal, and the staff is always friendly even when it's busy. Definitely recommend:).







Went here 2 days for breakfast. You order at the counter and within a few minutes your food arrives at a table outside in their deck. Half the price of eating at any resort and twice the quality. Lemon pancakes, pineapple French toast, and ham and cheese crepe all great.







Even though it was out of our way, we ended up going here for lunch twice because we liked their sandwiches and poke bowls so much. They had lots of options for my gluten and dairy free wife. One day we ordered sandwiches to go and brought them along on our hike. They also have lots of good grocery items, so we stocked up on goat cheese and other snacks to bring back to our B&B.







This place was our go-to stop throughout our entire trip.  While incredibly expensive (what isn't in Hawaii though?), it was absolutely delicious.

I ordered a poke bowl one day and it was excellent.  It was very fresh and beautifully prepared.  I also had the acai bowl at least twice - also very good.







Best coffee I had in Kauai! Came back for breakfast and it was delicious! Such a cute cafe that's primarily organic which is always a plus. Enjoyed our breakfast outside which was very lovely. The girl that helped us was so sweet and the market had great options - though expensive. But the cafe is worth it.







A little pricy but if you're looking for high quality goods from the mainland then it's great. We needed up at the local farmers market mostly for comparable produce.







Amazing market with local offerings. Came here every morning for breakfast during vacation because their options were better than anything at our hotel. The tasty coffee is roasted in house, and they even have a juice bar for healthy juices, smoothies and acai bowls.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







I love this sweet little market and juice bar for a natural, healthy breakfast or lunch. They make the most beautiful and delicious pitaya bowls and smoothies I've ever had. Great sandwiches, burgers, and wraps.







Jeff Sachinni(owner)  is the man . I've tried four meals( Breakfast Pizza, Rustic Egg, Italian Sandwich, and grab and go turkey sandwich) and I have not been let down once.







Amazing pizza; great market, probably the best woodfired pizza on the island. Pizza's are small and are $16 so you may need to order a couple.







Just ate lunch here and had the best savory crepe I have ever had. I got the roasted veggie - delicious and very tasty!! Good selection for vegetarians overall.







A review long overdue. Living Foods is the ultimate caterer on Kauai. I was back today planning our next corporate event. 

The exclusive dinner prepared for our team in the National Tropical Botanical Garden was off the charts.

The food was the quality of the greatest restaurants and they know wine.  Supervised by the owners, this experience was first class.  Our Executive Team and top producers experienced an incredible evening from champagne on the beach to an exceptional meal prepared and served in the exquisite location. 

Planning a special event on Kauai?  Talk to the folks there.  They were amazing.

If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

I work in the mall and this is one of my favorite places to go for lunch when I'm in the mood to splurge. Their pizzas are amazing! I usually get the Milano or if I'm in the mood for something healthy I'll get the Ahi Salad. My coworkers and I also like to go there for breakfast from time to time, because it tastes good and they give pretty big portions. It's a little pricey but that's to be expected in the Poipu area. Although for the price you're getting a great meal, and the staff is always friendly even when it's busy. Definitely recommend:).

Went here 2 days for breakfast. You order at the counter and within a few minutes your food arrives at a table outside in their deck. Half the price of eating at any resort and twice the quality. Lemon pancakes, pineapple French toast, and ham and cheese crepe all great.

Even though it was out of our way, we ended up going here for lunch twice because we liked their sandwiches and poke bowls so much. They had lots of options for my gluten and dairy free wife. One day we ordered sandwiches to go and brought them along on our hike. They also have lots of good grocery items, so we stocked up on goat cheese and other snacks to bring back to our B&B.

This place was our go-to stop throughout our entire trip.  While incredibly expensive (what isn't in Hawaii though?), it was absolutely delicious.I ordered a poke bowl one day and it was excellent.  It was very fresh and beautifully prepared.  I also had the acai bowl at least twice - also very good.

Best coffee I had in Kauai! Came back for breakfast and it was delicious! Such a cute cafe that's primarily organic which is always a plus. Enjoyed our breakfast outside which was very lovely. The girl that helped us was so sweet and the market had great options - though expensive. But the cafe is worth it.

Amazing market with local offerings. Came here every morning for breakfast during vacation because their options were better than anything at our hotel. The tasty coffee is roasted in house, and they even have a juice bar for healthy juices, smoothies and acai bowls.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. Check it out.








Beautiful natural soaps that smell good too!

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+

A review long overdue. Living Foods is the ultimate caterer on Kauai. I was back today planning our next corporate event. The exclusive dinner prepared for our team in the National Tropical Botanical Garden was off the charts.The food was the quality of the greatest restaurants and they know wine.  Supervised by the owners, this experience was first class.  Our Executive Team and top producers experienced an incredible evening from champagne on the beach to an exceptional meal prepared and served in the exquisite location. Planning a special event on Kauai?  Talk to the folks there.  They were amazing.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Over priced. If you are going to pay $14.00 for a deli sandwich it should be the best. Instead, it seems they put as little of each ingredient as possible. What a let down.







Living Foods offers Poke Bowls. This was the worst poke bowl I have ever had! It was 85% rice and mayo. HORRIBLE!!! Not even worth 1 star!







Ordered a burger to go, got home and found out the patty was the size of a silver dollar. Came with a little lettuce and the butt end of a tomato. $16.00 
The place is pretentious, unorganized, staff are rude/no training. Total rip off.







This was the worst meal I had while staying on the island and the worst service I have had as well.  Actually, this is the worst service I have had any restaurant in as long as I can remember.  I ordered blue berry ricotta pancakes with bacon.  I ordered the bacon extra crispy as I am pregnant.  The bacon came out and it was not crispy at all let alone extra crispy.  To make a long story short I had to ask 4 times to have my bacon exchanged for extra crispy.  After over an hour of waiting (and the 4 times asked) they brought me bacon that looked exactly the same as the original bacon.  I couldn't eat in and couldn't bear to ask again.  So no bacon for this pregnant woman.







I was happy to find such market in Poipu but my happiness turned sour when meeting the cashier. She was grumpy and sarcastic. I'm Asian, maybe she doesn't like my kind.







Poor service.
Very slow to.make food.
Charges for to go boxes?  What next? Napkins and cups are a charge too?
Had to wait extra long for an attitude to make 2 little pizzas when there wasn't anyone else before us.
Don't recommend







Sitting here drinking our NOT mochas made by a woman who we overheard admit to her co-worker that she's "screwing up" after making our coffees.   Ordering the coffee was painful as the woman had a frown when I ordered one Soy Mocha and one 1% Mocha. She looked at me as though I had made a mistake. But no, that's actually what I wanted. 

Meanwhile my husband was waiting to be helped 5 feet away at the deli counter. There were no other customers anywhere near the deli. But the two workers there just stared at my husband without approaching him. 

If you're looking for a store with good vegan options and friendly service, please go elsewhere. If you're looking for overpriced goods with sour service, you've found the place.







Rude rude rude people working here, especially the old guy behind counter and the snippety young girl with dark hair.  Tried twice.  Second time the managers all talking in front of liquor and would not move!  And would not come to front to ring up Iiquor for the minor cashier.  Out of towners stay away!  Whalers market down the street so much NICER people AND CHEAPER!







Your "see the cashier" to order food will make this business a failure.  There were at least 10 visible staff members and one person being helped...I gave up on ordering the Brisket Panini.







As a loyal Whole Foods customer  when not on vacation, I was excited to visit this store because it seemed right up my alley. I did really like looking around and appreciated their selection (overpriced like all groceries in Hawaii, but even more so)...until I interacted with the staff. They were rude and very un-accomodating. I placed an order for french fries minutes before 11:00am and they told me they couldn't serve me until after 11:00am because they only were serving breakfast. With a hungry kiddo with me, I wanted food ASAP so I ordered bfast potatoes. I asked if they would bring them to us on the patio (10 feet away) or if I had to wait for them inside. They said I had to come get them. When I came back to check on our food a few minutes later the 3 staff members I asked about the potatoes were standing around laughing and chatting together with only 2 other customers in the whole store (and many other staff). I was shocked they weren't willing to stop chatting to bring us the potatoes since they had seen me juggling a young child, groceries, and a huge diaper bag. I can say the breakfast potatoes were pretty good and the kale salad we got from their prepared foods section was decent. Their roasted beets with goat cheese (also from the prepared foods section) were NOT good and had eactly two pieces of goat cheese. We did not go back.







Sad, Whole Foods ripoff, that doesn't even halfway do it justice.

We stopped in tonight to grab din. I ordered the falafel wrap and a side of fries.

How can you possibly eff up a falafel wrap?

Ask the two incompetent chefs working the kitchen at 8:20 p.m. on 3/21/15. The falafel wrap was dry, loaded with harissa and sautéed veggies faijita-style. The two flavors clashed and ruined the wrap. It needed tzatziki sauce badly, so dry. Actually, I've never had a falafel wrap without it. Major miss. 

The fries were ok. 

Btw, they were out of ketchup so I notified one of the chefs. He simply looked up at me for a sec, and then proceeded with what he was doing. Not a word. A minute later another chef walked up. The first chef said, "There's no more ketchup". The second chef shouted across the counter to the coffee shop and said, "Brian, you're out of ketchup". Brian then proceeded to scrape the remaining ketchup off of a plastic container he retrieved from the back of the kitchen. Taking care of the customer, these 3 guys. So rude, even McDonald's treats customers and their requests more respectfully.

Save yourself some time. Groceries are overpriced, so if you can, drive over to Sueoka's Market. The food is not worth what you'll get charged for it, and the service is horrible. Go to Koloa Deli or Brick Oven Pizza, where you'll get amazing food and equally amazing customer service.







The breakfast sandwich was rubbish! Burnt breakfast potatoes, egg must have hit the pan running and the bacon was like rubber. Just saw someone else throw his in the trash. Overpriced rubbish!!







Very expensive grocery. About three times the prices of other grocery stores for the same brand.







Ever have one of those experiences that just standout as so unbelievable? We'll this was one of those for me. The deli food looked great but getting someone to help was impossible. I made the mistake of asking the pizza cook if I was in the right place to order and he went out of his way to make sure I knew how insulted he was that I spoke to him. Too bad cuz it's a very convenient location with some unique foods and wine. High prices and low customer service.







I'm sorry that I can give Living Foods Just One star only because I will give it 5 stars for being OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. Great establishment to walk around and peruse the aisles...but not someplace that you could frequent often.  Love their Peanut Butter cookies...I'll splurge on one for $3.00







I live about 1/2 mile from here - while it certainly has the fanciest stuff around in their deli, etc - the prices make it prohibitive for the vast majority of residents to go here.  

I have had lunch there 2/3 times with friends visiting here and while the food is good, the prices are just too much.

A good place if your wallet is fat!

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving? We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. No Aloha attitude here.RIP OFF ALERT! I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14! What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.

Over priced. If you are going to pay $14.00 for a deli sandwich it should be the best. Instead, it seems they put as little of each ingredient as possible. What a let down.

Ordered a burger to go, got home and found out the patty was the size of a silver dollar. Came with a little lettuce and the butt end of a tomato. $16.00 The place is pretentious, unorganized, staff are rude/no training. Total rip off.

This was the worst meal I had while staying on the island and the worst service I have had as well.  Actually, this is the worst service I have had any restaurant in as long as I can remember.  I ordered blue berry ricotta pancakes with bacon.  I ordered the bacon extra crispy as I am pregnant.  The bacon came out and it was not crispy at all let alone extra crispy.  To make a long story short I had to ask 4 times to have my bacon exchanged for extra crispy.  After over an hour of waiting (and the 4 times asked) they brought me bacon that looked exactly the same as the original bacon.  I couldn't eat in and couldn't bear to ask again.  So no bacon for this pregnant woman.

I was happy to find such market in Poipu but my happiness turned sour when meeting the cashier. She was grumpy and sarcastic. I'm Asian, maybe she doesn't like my kind.

Sitting here drinking our NOT mochas made by a woman who we overheard admit to her co-worker that she's "screwing up" after making our coffees.   Ordering the coffee was painful as the woman had a frown when I ordered one Soy Mocha and one 1% Mocha. She looked at me as though I had made a mistake. But no, that's actually what I wanted. Meanwhile my husband was waiting to be helped 5 feet away at the deli counter. There were no other customers anywhere near the deli. But the two workers there just stared at my husband without approaching him. If you're looking for a store with good vegan options and friendly service, please go elsewhere. If you're looking for overpriced goods with sour service, you've found the place.

As a loyal Whole Foods customer  when not on vacation, I was excited to visit this store because it seemed right up my alley. I did really like looking around and appreciated their selection (overpriced like all groceries in Hawaii, but even more so)...until I interacted with the staff. They were rude and very un-accomodating. I placed an order for french fries minutes before 11:00am and they told me they couldn't serve me until after 11:00am because they only were serving breakfast. With a hungry kiddo with me, I wanted food ASAP so I ordered bfast potatoes. I asked if they would bring them to us on the patio (10 feet away) or if I had to wait for them inside. They said I had to come get them. When I came back to check on our food a few minutes later the 3 staff members I asked about the potatoes were standing around laughing and chatting together with only 2 other customers in the whole store (and many other staff). I was shocked they weren't willing to stop chatting to bring us the potatoes since they had seen me juggling a young child, groceries, and a huge diaper bag. I can say the breakfast potatoes were pretty good and the kale salad we got from their prepared foods section was decent. Their roasted beets with goat cheese (also from the prepared foods section) were NOT good and had eactly two pieces of goat cheese. We did not go back.

Sad, Whole Foods ripoff, that doesn't even halfway do it justice.We stopped in tonight to grab din. I ordered the falafel wrap and a side of fries.How can you possibly eff up a falafel wrap?Ask the two incompetent chefs working the kitchen at 8:20 p.m. on 3/21/15. The falafel wrap was dry, loaded with harissa and sautéed veggies faijita-style. The two flavors clashed and ruined the wrap. It needed tzatziki sauce badly, so dry. Actually, I've never had a falafel wrap without it. Major miss. The fries were ok. Btw, they were out of ketchup so I notified one of the chefs. He simply looked up at me for a sec, and then proceeded with what he was doing. Not a word. A minute later another chef walked up. The first chef said, "There's no more ketchup". The second chef shouted across the counter to the coffee shop and said, "Brian, you're out of ketchup". Brian then proceeded to scrape the remaining ketchup off of a plastic container he retrieved from the back of the kitchen. Taking care of the customer, these 3 guys. So rude, even McDonald's treats customers and their requests more respectfully.Save yourself some time. Groceries are overpriced, so if you can, drive over to Sueoka's Market. The food is not worth what you'll get charged for it, and the service is horrible. Go to Koloa Deli or Brick Oven Pizza, where you'll get amazing food and equally amazing customer service.

Ever have one of those experiences that just standout as so unbelievable? We'll this was one of those for me. The deli food looked great but getting someone to help was impossible. I made the mistake of asking the pizza cook if I was in the right place to order and he went out of his way to make sure I knew how insulted he was that I spoke to him. Too bad cuz it's a very convenient location with some unique foods and wine. High prices and low customer service.

I'm sorry that I can give Living Foods Just One star only because I will give it 5 stars for being OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. Great establishment to walk around and peruse the aisles...but not someplace that you could frequent often.  Love their Peanut Butter cookies...I'll splurge on one for $3.00

I live about 1/2 mile from here - while it certainly has the fanciest stuff around in their deli, etc - the prices make it prohibitive for the vast majority of residents to go here.  I have had lunch there 2/3 times with friends visiting here and while the food is good, the prices are just too much.A good place if your wallet is fat!

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.

WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.








They hand cut bacon... never again.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.








Dryest pancakes I've ever had.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+








Really good!

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.








They hand cut bacon... never again.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too.

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.








Dryest pancakes I've ever had.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.

WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.








They hand cut bacon... never again.

Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving? We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. No Aloha attitude here.RIP OFF ALERT! I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14! What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.

Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!

If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. Check it out.

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.








Dryest pancakes I've ever had.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.

WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.








They hand cut bacon... never again.

Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving? We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. No Aloha attitude here.RIP OFF ALERT! I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14! What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.

Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!

If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. Check it out.








Beautiful natural soaps that smell good too!

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+








Really good!

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

We discovered Living Foods on our first day (er... first few HOURS) upon arriving in Kauai. We were staying new Poipu beach, and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries. 

We feel fortunate to have found this place early on, as it provided many meals of healthy, fresh foods. Most it was used for milk for breakfast, wines for evenings, and salads for dinner. One night I had the poke bowl (compared to Pono Market and Foodland, the Poke was too expensive for the price, in my honest opinion).

Overall a great find, despite prices eeking out at a little too high. THat being said, you're getting QUALITY food on an island, so just enjoy your vacation (if that's your purpose there), and let yourself indulge a bit.







WATCH OUT!!! $$$$$
Watch what the Butcher is charging you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The main issue I have with this market has been with the butcher department. I have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again. The first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin. Bc when I got home and cooked my 14$ pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps (not cool, but also not a big deal, I would hope/think a butcher would know how to cut bacon, or at least ask the preference of the cut, but she didn't so I remember for the next time...). The second time I go, I get a different but your lady and I asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as I was there describing how thin and uneatable it was. Instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which would've been 6 to 9$ dollars she charge me for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin which happened to be $15 a half a pound. After telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price. When I refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right ( turned out to be 6$). Again I tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed. This time I got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up $32 for Bacon wrapped Tenderloin. I immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again. But all he said was sorry but that doesn't settle right with me...Now I know I am not the only person she has done this too, ESP of this is the second time she's done it to me in a week and a half. I can't imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals! That is 4xs what is normally cost, now I don't know what Living Foods mission is but if it's stealing from people, I will not be shopping there anymore. 
Also on a side note, you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for 7-10$...for a bell pepper and some strawberries, which are on the shelves old, completely moldy and bruised. You can't sell that nor should it be on your shelves. If you want a store that runs on quality don't put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money.  I am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything I buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality, if I do decide to go back.







Yeah, okay, you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses, but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude, cranky, and clearly very unhappy? 

This place touts itself as believing in "living foods," but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving?

 We will skip this place in the future. There are small local markets with great produce, local fish markets, and other NICER places to go. 

No Aloha attitude here.

RIP OFF ALERT! 

I'm posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning. 

Just giving you all a heads up. The breakfast sandwich we ordered? Well it had one egg not two, and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised, but instead on a white flour hamburger bun. That sucker cost us $14!

 What we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of McDonalds. I would've returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were 30 minutes away.

The roast beef roll-up, $12, had almost maybe kinda sorta 2 oz of roast beef and about 3 inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless. 

Thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off, and offers really poor value.







Living in California this is very much like Whole Foods. I am used to their high prices so these prices didn't send me into a frenzy. While the prices are a bit high they don't skip a beat on the food, everything is to quality and delicious. The Acai bowls are to die for and a must!







If you want some good Java, talk to Phil. Great guy originally from California who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house. We had tried several bags around the island before coming here. This place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location. Lots of restaurants, boutiques... walking distance from a few resorts in the Poipu area. I also saw a few Kauai Juices and kombuchas in the fridge section. Lots of great wines, snacks and prepared food to grab and go.







This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! 

This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too. Lots of Hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other Hawaiian spices. 

I also grabbed breakfast to go here. I got the breakfast burrito for $15. It was loaded with veggies, eggs and some meat. I found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough. They do charge an extra $.75 for Togo items so be warned. 

I thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home. 

Check it out.







The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!







This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.







Amazing breakfast find in a strip mall. Eggs fresh and creamy, toast whole wheat,  bacon local pig...coffee was nutty and local beans ground to order.  Pleasantly satisfied... 2 thumbs up to living foods market. They believe in what they sell and use only local..kudos to them







This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!







This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.

Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!

I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.







Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! 

They also have the best thin crust pizza. 

Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.







We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.







This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.







I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!







Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.







Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+







A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.







Breakfast pizza breakfast pizza! So good.... this place has it all .....healthy food ....good coffee..... great place







Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. 
I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.

Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.

Not impressed.

This place reminded me of a Whole Foods but on a more local, smaller scale. I loved all of the all natural local goods here. I know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them, the cost increases. I believe it is worth it. I picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut, coconut and other oils that smelled amazing! This is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too.

The only reason they get 4 stars is because it's EXPENSIVE. but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes. They do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate!

This market has an amazing food lanai, simply named "The Lanai."  Yet, there's nothing simple about their menu. We were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar. They make THE BEST burger on Kauai, hands down. The high quality beef, the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile. The appetizers are decent and flavorful. I'd recommend the avocado croquettes with some Kona Brewery beer.

This is a nice little health food store in a great location. Lots of grocery and produce choices, with the option of ordering hot food and coffee, too. The veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious, in addition to the Moroccan Cous Cous salad. It's definitely a little pricey and they charge you 75 cents each to-go box. Worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if you're not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot!

This place has so much to offer! But if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on Hawaii time :) Be patient.Go outside to the juice bar and get the Green Machine or Green Goodness. It is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies I've ever had! We came here 2x for it!I also tried one of their poke bowls. I love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings. It was SO tasty. Wish I had time to come back here for more. Their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didn't have a chance to try them.

Perfectly cooked bacon, reasonably priced, excellently spiced breakfast potatoes, clever muffin flavors, huge egg sandwiches, fluffy pancakes - and that's just breakfast! They also have the best thin crust pizza. Their market caters to an international crowd, so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as Trader Joes.

We come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation! Great breakfasts. We pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes. There is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected. Not creamy at all. They taste like instant , dense, rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are 15 bucks. Major fail on those.








Dryest pancakes I've ever had.

This place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude.  The 2 employees I encountered today were awful.  First employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms. After almost 5 minutes of standing there being ignored  I asked if she could ring me up and she says " I guess so".  She rings me up and the item is rung up for $3 more than it was listed for. I bring this to her attention and she says "if it rings up that price then that's the price that it is." I stand my ground and say that it's listed on the shelf as $4.99 not $7.99. Another employee again argues with me that I'm wrong. He goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say "yes, indeed it is marked for $4.99 but if you would of read the label that's for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs."  He had so much attitude and sass in his reply.  I don't think I've ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect.  Instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots I tell employee that he's so rude and leave. I'll never go back to this store. I've already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food.  I left and went to Kukuiula  Market where I payed less and was treated with common courtesy.

I bought here  a $10,48 mozzarella Galbani and when I had it I figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual. I checked the package and it was 1 month expired!!! I went back to the shop and with quite indifference  I've been refund of my $10. I had the feeling it wasn't the first time it happened to them!

Everything about this place screams class and high end food.  In reality it's basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall.  Service is poor and rude.  A man in front of me in line wasn't understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter - she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all.  We've had poke for 13 days straight so I tried it there and it's the worst I've had, it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest we've had.  There are SO many good places to eat around Poipu, don't waste your time and money here.

Coolest place ever BUT EXPENSIVE! Great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions, fresh fruits, nuts and fifty items. Just about everything you need is here. Love the deli case and the sandwiches are great. On this particular day, I had a burger and salad. Cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun. Subbed the fries for a side salad/vinegarette. A+

A pricy gourmet that makes Whole Foods seam like a value priced super market. The poke bowels were very good for $13.95, but the Caesar salad for $8.95 was not very good. The wine selection was ok but overpriced. We found a larger selection and better prices at the Longs Drug Store at the other end of this shopping center.

Wow-slowwwwww is the word for the pace here. I waited 10 minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told I had to pay st the cashier first. 20 minutes after coming in I'm still waiting for my simple BLT sandwich. I counted 8 people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers.Later-the sandwich arrived, and it was reasonably tasty, though the $15 price tag left a bitter after taste. I guess this store wants to be a Whole Paycheck of Kauai too.Not impressed.

Living Foods Market & Cafe Restaurant Review: An island destination for simple meals such as salads, pizza, panini, wraps and crêpes, all prepared on site, with gourmet selections ready to buy and cook at home, this market/café is a niche concept for the island. Although created to highlight local products, it misses that mark with a meager selection of Kauai-raised meat and produce. Instead, much of the stock is imported, with prices significantly higher than can be found elsewhere. However, it's a good place to pick up coffee and find specialty groceries that otherwise aren’t available, and we also like the smoothies made from seasonal fresh fruits.
