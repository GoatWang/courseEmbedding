La Française takes majority stake in Forum Securities


February 18, 2016

French investment group La Française will take a majority ownership in investment advisor Forum Securities Ltd two year years after launching a strategic partnership with Forum Securities’ parent company, Forum Partners. The new integrated platform will be re-branded La Française Forum Securities. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.
PRESS RELEASE
GREENWICH, Conn.–(Business Wire)–Two years after the announcement of their strategic partnership and the successful launch of the La Française Lux – Forum Global Real Estate Securities Fund, Forum Partners, subject to regulatory approval, will transfer an 80% interest in its wholly owned subsidiary, Forum Securities Limited, to La Française. The transfer is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.
Forum Securities Limited (“Forum Securities”) is an SEC registered investment advisor managing private investment accounts for institutions and family offices, with an investment focus on long-only and hedged global real estate public securities strategies. The business was established in 2009 and has seven full-time employees, six of whom perform investment, advisory and research functions. Employees represent seven nationalities and speak ten languages. Forum Securities has offices in Greenwich, CT (USA), Singapore and London. The team is recognized for its “out of the box” approach.
The new integrated platform will be re-branded La Française Forum Securities and will allow Forum Securities enhanced back office and reporting capabilities as well as stronger business development and client relations support. La Française will continue to expand its international footprint with a presence in the US and Asian markets. Together the firms will look to broaden their product offering to include: infrastructure/commodities, a Sharia compliant listed real estate investment fund, listed Green real estate funds, sector specific listed real estate funds and other customized strategies that meet investor demands. 





The existing product line will continue to be managed by the Forum Securities team which will be reinforced to support the expected growth in offerings. Jana Sehnalova, Portfolio Manager within the Forum Securities Limited team, will be the Global Head and Managing Director of La Française Forum Securities and will report to Pascale Auclair, Global Head of Investments of La Française Global Asset Management.
Jana Sehnalova, Global Portfolio Manager
Ms. Sehnalova is Global Portfolio Manager with over 15 years of real estate and equities experience. She is based in the Forum Securities office in Singapore. In the past, Ms. Sehnalova covered European, Australasian and emerging market real estate companies. Before joining Forum Securities, she worked as a Portfolio Manager and an International Analyst in the Global Real Estate Securities team at Citi Property Investors and prior to that at European Investors Inc. She holds an LLM in law (summa cum laude), from Charles University’s Faculty of Law in Prague, Czech Republic and an MBA from the University of Economics in Prague. She participated in the MBA Exchange Program at the University of North Carolina / Kenan Flagler Business School in the US and in the Erasmus Program at the University of Law in Hamburg in Germany. Ms. Sehnalova speaks seven languages.
Philippe Lecomte, CEO of La Française International said, “This is a win-win scenario. Forum Securities will gain full access to La Française resources and global fundraising capabilities. Investors will benefit from a broader real estate investments product line, and La Française will further expand its international development and footprint, by gaining solid exposure to the US and Singapore markets. Real estate, both listed and unlisted, is occupying an increasingly significant percentage of investor asset allocations.” 





Jana Sehnalova of Forum Securities said, “We are very excited about the investment and commitment made by La Française. This represents a unique opportunity for our innovative, global team to continue to build out a diversified and complete product range within listed real assets. We are hopeful that the global client network of La Française will find these new products to be valuable additions to their portfolios.”

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

La Française strengthens its equities team

                13 April 2017
            
As part of the development of its SRI equities range, La Française has strengthened its investment management team by hiring Nina Lagron as Senior Portfolio Manager reporting to the CIO Equities, Laurent Jacquier-Laforge.










Nina is tri-lingual and comes to the group with more than twenty years’ experience in financial markets. She is a recognised expert in emerging market equities investments. Laurent Jacquier-Laforge, CIO Equities, said, “She will be a major asset who will help La Française achieve its ambitions in responsible equities investments while also broadening its global management capabilities, particularly with respect to the Zero Carbon investment strategy.”
Before joining La Française, Nina Lagron held various positions: emerging equities manager at Amundi for more than seven years looking after the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. She was the first woman to run an equities fund investing solely in the Middle East, primarily in Saudi Arabia. Nina then moved on to co-manage the GemEquity fund at Gemway Assets for more than two years.
She has a Masters in Management and a postgraduate degree in Finance from the Université Paris IX - Dauphine. She is also a Chartered Financial Analyst.
