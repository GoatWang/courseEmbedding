Description



Quantity – 240
AR-Encap is a comprehensive joint support formula that goes beyond simple glucosamine supplementation.* This formula supplies the recommended daily amount of glucosamine supported by clinical studies  in combination with other joint-supporting nutrients and botanicals.* MSM supplies organic sulfur for important glycosaminoglycans (GAG) synthesis, including chondroitin sulfate. Curcumin phytosome has demonstrated significantly better absorption than ordinary curcumin and helps support the body’s normal inflammatory response.* Boswellia appears to inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase enzymes, thus promoting the body’s normal inflammatory response.* Extracts of devil’s claw have been found to exert significant joint support in animal studies.*
 
Ingredients:
Four Capsules Contain:Chloride (from Glucosamine Sulfate Potassium Chloride complex) 87 mg.Potassium (from Glucosamine Sulfate Potassium Chloride complex) 98 mg.Methyl Sulfonyl Methane (MSM) 850 mg.Glucosamine Sulfate (as Glucosamine Sulfate Potassium Chloride complex) 750 mg.Indian Frankincense extract (gum) (Boswellia serrata) 350 mg.Curcumin Phytosome* (Curcuma longa extract (root) / Phosphatidylcholine complex) 250 mg.Devil’s Claw extract (root) (Harpagophytum procumbens) 200 mg.
Other Ingredients: Hypromellose (derived from cellulose) capsule, Leucine, Silicon Dioxide.
*This product uses Indena S.p.A.’s curcumin phytosome (Meriva®). Meriva is a registered trademark of Indena S.p.A.
Boswellia standardized to Beta Boswellic Acids 20%. Harpagophytum standardized to Harpagosides 1.8%. 
Contains ingredients derived from shellfish (glucosamine sulfate = crab and/or shrimp) and soy (phytosome).
 
Warnings: ALLERGY WARNINGS This product is contraindicated in an individual with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients. AR-Encap contains glucosamine derived from shellfish. AR-Encap contains curcumin phytosome, a plant extract complexed with phosphatidylcholine, which is derived from soy. Phosphatidylcholine contains no soy protein. There are no other soy-based ingredients in AR-Encap. EXCIPIENT FREE This product does not contain wheat, gluten, corn, yeast, egg, dairy products, or artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors. This product also does not contain lactose; palmitic acid; or magnesium, calcium or vegetable stearates. PREGNANCY WARNING If pregnant, consult your health-care practitioner before using this product. INTERACTIONS/CONTRAINDICATIONS Curcumin has been shown to reduce the therapeutic efficacy of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) in animal studies. In vitro research revealed that curcumin decreased camptothecin-induced death of cultured breast cancer cells. Curcumin might also interfere with the absorption and efficacy of the chemotherapy drug irinotecan, used to treat colon cancer. The concurrent use of curcumin with these agents should be avoided.

Oscap Plus$36.90

Supplement Company: Thorne Research.
Share on: 





Description



Quantity – 180
Extensive human studies show ipriflavone promotes bone density; in fact, over 60 human clinical trials have demonstrated ipriflavone’s effectiveness in supporting bone density.* Supplementation of six capsules per day of Thorne Research’s Oscap Plus provides 600 mg ipriflavone, the amount used in the majority of these studies. In addition, because research indicates the benefit of both vitamins K1 and K2 in maintaining good bone health, both are included in Oscap Plus.* Vitamin K activates osteocalcin, the protein that facilitates incorporation of calcium into the bone matrix.*

Ingredients:
Three Capsules Contain:Vitamin D (as Vitamin D3) 300 IU.Vitamin K (200 mcg as Vitamin K1 and 200 mcg as Vitamin K2) 400 mcg.Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxal 5′-Phosphate) 13.5 mg.Folate (50 mcg as Calcium Folinate and 50 mcg as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate from L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt) 100 mcg.Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin) 50 mcg.Calcium (as Calcium Citrate-Malate) 300 mg.Magnesium (as Magnesium Citrate-Malate) 150 mg.Ipriflavone 300 mg.Boron (as Boron Picolinate) 1.5 mg.Vanadium (as Vanadium Picolinate) 50 mcg.
 Other Ingredients: Hypromellose (derived from cellulose) capsule, Leucine, Silicon Dioxide.


Warnings:
ALLERGY WARNINGS This product is contraindicated in an individual with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.  EXCIPIENT FREE This product does not contain wheat, gluten, corn, yeast, egg, dairy products, or artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors. This product also does not contain lactose, palmitic acid, or magnesium, calcium, or vegetable stearates.  PREGNANCY WARNING If pregnant, consult your health-care practitioner before using this product.  INTERACTIONS/CONTRAINDICATIONS As vitamin K interferes with the effect of anticoagulant drugs (like Coumadin/warfarin), the concurrent use of Oscap Plus with these agents should be avoided.  5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) and folinic acid are not recommended concurrently with methotrexate cancer therapy, as they can interfere with methotrexate’s anti-neoplastic activity; however, they have not been shown to interfere with the anti-inflammatory activity of methotrexate. An individual taking methotrexate for psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis can safely take a supplement containing folate.  OTHER WARNINGS Subclinical lymphocytopenia (low white blood cells called lymphocytes) was noted with ipriflavone administration in 13 percent of participants in one study. Values were restored after ipriflavone withdrawal.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.
