Anti-malware software is something you should seriously consider looking into.

History[edit]
Company was founded in Brno, Czech Republic by Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer in 1991 as GRISOFT /C/ SOFTWARE, spol. s r. o.. It was owned by Jan Gritzbach.
In 2001, Jan Gritzbach decided to sell Grisoft to Benson Oak Capital Acquisitions. Holding company Grisoft, Inc. based in Wilmington, Delaware was used for the transaction. In 2002 the company was renamed to GRISOFT, s.r.o.. Three years later, Benson Oak sold a 65% share in the company to Intel Capital and Enterprise Investors for US$52 million.[5][6][7] Holding company was Grisoft Holdings B.V. based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, later Grisoft International B.V., that gradually became the main company.
On 19 April 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company ewido Networks, an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.[8][9] On 6 November 2006, Microsoft announced that AVG Security products would be available directly from the Windows Security Center in Windows Vista.[10] Since 7 June 2006, the AVG software has also been used as an optional component of GFI MailSecurity, produced by GFI Software.[11] On 5 December 2007, Grisoft announced the acquisition of Exploit Prevention Labs, developer of the LinkScanner safe surfing technology.[12]
In 2008 GRISOFT, s.r.o. was renamed to AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and Grisoft International B.V. to AVG Technologies, N.V.. This change was made to increase the effectiveness of their marketing activities.[13] In January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized. Plans to integrate Sana's technologies in their free consumer product, AVG Anti-Virus, are still under consideration, according to JR Smith, AVG's chief executive. Sana Security's developed technologies are currently licensed to Symantec.[14][15][16] On 5 October 2009, TA Associates announced that they bought a minority stake in AVG Technologies for more than US$200 million.[17] On April 2010, AVG announced the appointed of security industry veteran Yuval Ben-Itzhak as senior vice president of engineering. Ben-Itzhak became the Chief Technology Officer later that year. On 9 June 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of North Carolina-based Walling Data, a North America security software distribution that has distributed AVG offerings across the United States since 2001[18] On 10 November 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based DroidSecurity, a company that specializes in the field of mobile security solutions, for Android devices. Upon completion of the acquisition DroidSecurity will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AVG and DroidSecurity CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team.[19] In December 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue.[20]
On 28 January 2011, a dangerous rogue appeared. The interface and graphics resemble the previous version of the software and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems. The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]
In 2011 the group was restructured again. AVG Technologies Holdings B.V. was founded, having AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and AVG Technologies, N.V. as its subsidiaries. On 7 February 2012 AVG Technologies, N.V. was listed on New York Stock Exchange. On 12 June 2013, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Level Platforms.[24]
March 8, 2013 JR Smith, CEO, tendered his resignation from AVG after eight years as CEO and leading the company to a successful IPO on the NYSE and delivering eight quarters of successive high-growth. On 30 July 2013, AVG Technologies announced Gary Kovacs as the company's new CEO.[25]
In November 2014, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Norman Safeground ASA, an Oslo-based company known for their Norman suite of security products.[26] AVG Technologies announced in May 2015 the acquisition of Privax a UK based company which is an owner of HideMyAss VPN service.[27] In September 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Location Labs, a company with personal security products on all four major US cellular carriers.[28]
On 7 July 2016, Avast Software announced that it intended to acquire AVG Technologies for a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, for a total of around $1.3 billion.[3] The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2016 and Avast and AVG operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.[4] The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.[29]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

Upon completion of the acquisition DroidSecurity will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AVG and DroidSecurity CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team.[19] In December 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue.[20]
On 28 January 2011, a dangerous rogue appeared. The interface and graphics resemble the previous version of the software and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems. The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

History[edit]
Company was founded in Brno, Czech Republic by Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer in 1991 as GRISOFT /C/ SOFTWARE, spol. s r. o.. It was owned by Jan Gritzbach.
In 2001, Jan Gritzbach decided to sell Grisoft to Benson Oak Capital Acquisitions. Holding company Grisoft, Inc. based in Wilmington, Delaware was used for the transaction. In 2002 the company was renamed to GRISOFT, s.r.o.. Three years later, Benson Oak sold a 65% share in the company to Intel Capital and Enterprise Investors for US$52 million.[5][6][7] Holding company was Grisoft Holdings B.V. based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, later Grisoft International B.V., that gradually became the main company.
On 19 April 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company ewido Networks, an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.[8][9] On 6 November 2006, Microsoft announced that AVG Security products would be available directly from the Windows Security Center in Windows Vista.[10] Since 7 June 2006, the AVG software has also been used as an optional component of GFI MailSecurity, produced by GFI Software.[11] On 5 December 2007, Grisoft announced the acquisition of Exploit Prevention Labs, developer of the LinkScanner safe surfing technology.[12]
In 2008 GRISOFT, s.r.o. was renamed to AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and Grisoft International B.V. to AVG Technologies, N.V.. This change was made to increase the effectiveness of their marketing activities.[13] In January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized.

History[edit]
Company was founded in Brno, Czech Republic by Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer in 1991 as GRISOFT /C/ SOFTWARE, spol. s r. o.. It was owned by Jan Gritzbach.
In 2001, Jan Gritzbach decided to sell Grisoft to Benson Oak Capital Acquisitions. Holding company Grisoft, Inc. based in Wilmington, Delaware was used for the transaction. In 2002 the company was renamed to GRISOFT, s.r.o.. Three years later, Benson Oak sold a 65% share in the company to Intel Capital and Enterprise Investors for US$52 million.[5][6][7] Holding company was Grisoft Holdings B.V. based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, later Grisoft International B.V., that gradually became the main company.
On 19 April 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company ewido Networks, an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.[8][9] On 6 November 2006, Microsoft announced that AVG Security products would be available directly from the Windows Security Center in Windows Vista.[10] Since 7 June 2006, the AVG software has also been used as an optional component of GFI MailSecurity, produced by GFI Software.[11] On 5 December 2007, Grisoft announced the acquisition of Exploit Prevention Labs, developer of the LinkScanner safe surfing technology.[12]
In 2008 GRISOFT, s.r.o. was renamed to AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and Grisoft International B.V. to AVG Technologies, N.V.. This change was made to increase the effectiveness of their marketing activities.[13] In January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized. Plans to integrate Sana's technologies in their free consumer product, AVG Anti-Virus, are still under consideration, according to JR Smith, AVG's chief executive. Sana Security's developed technologies are currently licensed to Symantec.[14][15][16] On 5 October 2009, TA Associates announced that they bought a minority stake in AVG Technologies for more than US$200 million.[17] On April 2010, AVG announced the appointed of security industry veteran Yuval Ben-Itzhak as senior vice president of engineering. Ben-Itzhak became the Chief Technology Officer later that year. On 9 June 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of North Carolina-based Walling Data, a North America security software distribution that has distributed AVG offerings across the United States since 2001[18] On 10 November 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based DroidSecurity, a company that specializes in the field of mobile security solutions, for Android devices. Upon completion of the acquisition DroidSecurity will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AVG and DroidSecurity CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team.[19] In December 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue.[20]
On 28 January 2011, a dangerous rogue appeared. The interface and graphics resemble the previous version of the software and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems. The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]
In 2011 the group was restructured again. AVG Technologies Holdings B.V. was founded, having AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and AVG Technologies, N.V. as its subsidiaries. On 7 February 2012 AVG Technologies, N.V. was listed on New York Stock Exchange. On 12 June 2013, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Level Platforms.[24]
March 8, 2013 JR Smith, CEO, tendered his resignation from AVG after eight years as CEO and leading the company to a successful IPO on the NYSE and delivering eight quarters of successive high-growth. On 30 July 2013, AVG Technologies announced Gary Kovacs as the company's new CEO.[25]
In November 2014, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Norman Safeground ASA, an Oslo-based company known for their Norman suite of security products.[26] AVG Technologies announced in May 2015 the acquisition of Privax a UK based company which is an owner of HideMyAss VPN service.[27] In September 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Location Labs, a company with personal security products on all four major US cellular carriers.[28]
On 7 July 2016, Avast Software announced that it intended to acquire AVG Technologies for a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, for a total of around $1.3 billion.[3] The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2016 and Avast and AVG operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.[4] The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.[29]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]
In 2011 the group was restructured again. AVG Technologies Holdings B.V. was founded, having AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and AVG Technologies, N.V. as its subsidiaries. On 7 February 2012 AVG Technologies, N.V. was listed on New York Stock Exchange. On 12 June 2013, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Level Platforms.[24]
March 8, 2013 JR Smith, CEO, tendered his resignation from AVG after eight years as CEO and leading the company to a successful IPO on the NYSE and delivering eight quarters of successive high-growth. On 30 July 2013, AVG Technologies announced Gary Kovacs as the company's new CEO.[25]
In November 2014, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Norman Safeground ASA, an Oslo-based company known for their Norman suite of security products.[26] AVG Technologies announced in May 2015 the acquisition of Privax a UK based company which is an owner of HideMyAss VPN service.[27] In September 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Location Labs, a company with personal security products on all four major US cellular carriers.[28]
On 7 July 2016, Avast Software announced that it intended to acquire AVG Technologies for a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, for a total of around $1.3 billion.[3] The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2016 and Avast and AVG operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.[4] The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.[29]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

Now with advanced ransomware protection
Banking, browsing, shopping —  AVG Internet Security offers extra protection for those who live online. Shield yourself against hacker attacks, scan for malware and performance issues, and avoid fake websites.
Our Ransomware Protection now goes one step further: we protect your PC from attacks that would encrypt it for ransom, and we stop any untrusted app from changing or deleting your files. 

















Computer Protection











Web & Email Protection











Hacker Attack Protection











Private Data Protection











Payment Protection











Unlimited Family Protection













Computer Protection
Our first line of defense for your PC
 
Our advanced antivirus scans for, removes and flat-out stops viruses, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, Trojans, and other nasty malware —  and because it all happens in real time, we can catch threats before they reach you. We secure your USB and DVD drives just as quickly, too. 
Our favorite bit? It updates your security automatically, and uses advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and real-time analysis to help stop even the newest threats from getting near you.










 
See all the features  



Advanced Antivirus
Thoroughly scans every corner of your computer (and any drives connected to it) in real-time for viruses, ransomware, spyware, worms, Trojans, rootkits, and other malware. You can even schedule whole-computer scans for those times you won't even be at your computer.


AI Detection
Uses advanced artificial intelligence on your computer to proactively identify malware samples that haven't yet been catalogued by our ThreatLabs team.


PUA Scanner
Scans for potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) that you may have unknowingly downloaded (e.g., adware and other malicious applications bundled with downloaded software).


CyberCapture
Cloud-based technology helps stop even the newest malware variants and outbreaks in real-time. Anytime our antivirus encounters an unknown threat, it uploads it to our ThreatLabs team for analysis. They'll then send out a cure to all our millions of users via a security update. The end result? Better protection for everyone.


Turbo Scan
Dramatically shortens scanning times by intelligently skipping files it already knows are safe (i.e., files unchanged since they were last scanned).


Software Analyzer
Like an alert watchdog, this feature works in real-time to sniff out suspicious behavior of any software running on your computer and warn you if anything is amiss. This helps protect against 0-day threats, malicious programs, and even keyloggers that secretly record typed passwords and bank account details.


Real-Time Updates
Ensures that your security is always up-to-date by pushing virus definitions, bug fixes, security updates, and new features to you as they become available.


Silent Mode
We don’t mess with movie time. Silent Mode postpones scans, updates, and popups to avoid interrupting you while you're working, playing games, or watching videos.

























Web & Email Protection
The safest way to connect
 
Your email has never been safer. Our Email Shield technology specifically targets email attachments to stop threats, wherever they may come from — malicious senders or friends sending malware out unknowingly.  
Your online security is guaranteed with real-time link & download scanning, and protection against unsecure Wi-Fi spots. If you click it, we scan it — with our best internet security software, you always know your way is clear.


 
Peek under the shield 



Email Shield
Blocks dangerous email attachments to prevent you from falling victim to fake emails or friends who may have unknowingly forwarded you malware.


Link Scanner

Online Shield
Scans downloaded files before they reach your computer to protect you against hidden malware.


Wi-Fi Guard

Hacker Attack Protection
Keep hackers and ransom seekers away
 
Our Enhanced Firewall gives you full control over exactly who and what comes in and out of your PC. And our Ransomware Protection provides an extra layer of protection against ever-increasing ransomware attacks. That means nobody messes with any of your private data, files, photos, and passwords — no hackers, no ransomware, nothing. 













 
Look behind the wall   



Enhanced Firewall
Effortlessly bounces hackers, criminals, and snoopers who try sneaking onto your PC to steal your private files, photos, & passwords. Works on both wired and wireless networks.


Ransomware Protection
Walls off your personal photos, documents, and files from malicious encryption. And it takes malware protection one step further, by giving you total control over which apps can change or delete your files. 

























Private Data Protection
Your personal files, for your eyes only
 
Encrypt and hide your most private photos and files so that even if your PC gets into other hands, you can prevent friends, relatives, and of course thieves from seeing what’s yours. And once you’re done with a file for good, you can choose to permanently shred it. 


 
Open the vault 



Data Safe
Got something you don't want anyone else to see? Encrypt and hide your most private photos and files to prevent family, friends, or thieves from seeing what's yours.


File Shredder
Did you know that files deleted from your Recycle Bin can still be recovered? File Shredder securely deletes data to help prevent unintended or unauthorized recovery.
















Payment Protection
Shop and bank online freely and securely
 
Whether browsing, banking, or shopping, this is the added internet protection you need. We block spam and scams, and even help you avoid fake copycat websites, to prevent you from accidentally giving our passwords or credit card numbers to the bad guys.


 
See what’s in the box 



Anti-Spam
We block spam, scams, and malicious phishing emails to keep your inbox cleaner and help stop you from giving your passwords and credit card numbers to the bad guys.
              


Secure DNS
Helps you avoid fake websites so you don't unknowingly give criminals your passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. We do this by preventing criminals from hijacking your DNS (domain name system) settings by using our own secured DNS servers to faithfully direct you to real websites.

                        What is malware and how does it affect my computer?

According the trusty dictionary malware is “software which is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain authorized access to a computer system”. Pretty nasty stuff.

The internet is infested with software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, and obtain unauthorized access to your computer system. Also known as Malware. Malware comes in so many different shapes and sizes. It is practically impossible to say how many different types of malware there is because new types are being developed every single day. Anti-malware software is something you should seriously consider looking into.

                        How effective is antivirus software?

Closely followed to these headlines is usually a link. “Cover yourself here…”. How do you know these virus horror stories are not just advertisements for expensive antivirus software? Why would I want antivirus software?
The web is a dangerous place. A single person in their bedroom can do a significant amount of damage. Viruses have evolved massively throughout the years. They are now more lethal and harder to detect than ever. Viruses can disguise                     







                        Top 5 things to look for when buying antivirus software.                      


Choosing which antivirus software to buy is far from an easy decision. There are so many different products from so many different companies. All varying in price, features, type of protection, and so much more. Antivirus software is something you need. There is no other way to put it. But make sure you know what to look for when searching for what is right for you. Knowing what is best for you is the single most important factor.

History[edit]
Company was founded in Brno, Czech Republic by Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer in 1991 as GRISOFT /C/ SOFTWARE, spol. s r. o.. It was owned by Jan Gritzbach.
In 2001, Jan Gritzbach decided to sell Grisoft to Benson Oak Capital Acquisitions. Holding company Grisoft, Inc. based in Wilmington, Delaware was used for the transaction. In 2002 the company was renamed to GRISOFT, s.r.o.. Three years later, Benson Oak sold a 65% share in the company to Intel Capital and Enterprise Investors for US$52 million.[5][6][7] Holding company was Grisoft Holdings B.V. based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, later Grisoft International B.V., that gradually became the main company.
On 19 April 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company ewido Networks, an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.[8][9] On 6 November 2006, Microsoft announced that AVG Security products would be available directly from the Windows Security Center in Windows Vista.[10] Since 7 June 2006, the AVG software has also been used as an optional component of GFI MailSecurity, produced by GFI Software.[11] On 5 December 2007, Grisoft announced the acquisition of Exploit Prevention Labs, developer of the LinkScanner safe surfing technology.[12]
In 2008 GRISOFT, s.r.o. was renamed to AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and Grisoft International B.V. to AVG Technologies, N.V.. This change was made to increase the effectiveness of their marketing activities.[13] In January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized. Plans to integrate Sana's technologies in their free consumer product, AVG Anti-Virus, are still under consideration, according to JR Smith, AVG's chief executive. Sana Security's developed technologies are currently licensed to Symantec.[14][15][16] On 5 October 2009, TA Associates announced that they bought a minority stake in AVG Technologies for more than US$200 million.[17] On April 2010, AVG announced the appointed of security industry veteran Yuval Ben-Itzhak as senior vice president of engineering. Ben-Itzhak became the Chief Technology Officer later that year. On 9 June 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of North Carolina-based Walling Data, a North America security software distribution that has distributed AVG offerings across the United States since 2001[18] On 10 November 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based DroidSecurity, a company that specializes in the field of mobile security solutions, for Android devices. Upon completion of the acquisition DroidSecurity will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AVG and DroidSecurity CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team.[19] In December 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue.[20]
On 28 January 2011, a dangerous rogue appeared. The interface and graphics resemble the previous version of the software and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems. The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]
In 2011 the group was restructured again. AVG Technologies Holdings B.V. was founded, having AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and AVG Technologies, N.V. as its subsidiaries. On 7 February 2012 AVG Technologies, N.V. was listed on New York Stock Exchange. On 12 June 2013, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Level Platforms.[24]
March 8, 2013 JR Smith, CEO, tendered his resignation from AVG after eight years as CEO and leading the company to a successful IPO on the NYSE and delivering eight quarters of successive high-growth. On 30 July 2013, AVG Technologies announced Gary Kovacs as the company's new CEO.[25]
In November 2014, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Norman Safeground ASA, an Oslo-based company known for their Norman suite of security products.[26] AVG Technologies announced in May 2015 the acquisition of Privax a UK based company which is an owner of HideMyAss VPN service.[27] In September 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Location Labs, a company with personal security products on all four major US cellular carriers.[28]
On 7 July 2016, Avast Software announced that it intended to acquire AVG Technologies for a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, for a total of around $1.3 billion.[3] The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2016 and Avast and AVG operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.[4] The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.[29]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

History[edit]
Company was founded in Brno, Czech Republic by Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer in 1991 as GRISOFT /C/ SOFTWARE, spol. s r. o.. It was owned by Jan Gritzbach.
In 2001, Jan Gritzbach decided to sell Grisoft to Benson Oak Capital Acquisitions. Holding company Grisoft, Inc. based in Wilmington, Delaware was used for the transaction. In 2002 the company was renamed to GRISOFT, s.r.o.. Three years later, Benson Oak sold a 65% share in the company to Intel Capital and Enterprise Investors for US$52 million.[5][6][7] Holding company was Grisoft Holdings B.V. based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, later Grisoft International B.V., that gradually became the main company.
On 19 April 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company ewido Networks, an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.[8][9] On 6 November 2006, Microsoft announced that AVG Security products would be available directly from the Windows Security Center in Windows Vista.[10] Since 7 June 2006, the AVG software has also been used as an optional component of GFI MailSecurity, produced by GFI Software.[11] On 5 December 2007, Grisoft announced the acquisition of Exploit Prevention Labs, developer of the LinkScanner safe surfing technology.[12]
In 2008 GRISOFT, s.r.o. was renamed to AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and Grisoft International B.V. to AVG Technologies, N.V.. This change was made to increase the effectiveness of their marketing activities.[13] In January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized. Plans to integrate Sana's technologies in their free consumer product, AVG Anti-Virus, are still under consideration, according to JR Smith, AVG's chief executive. Sana Security's developed technologies are currently licensed to Symantec.[14][15][16] On 5 October 2009, TA Associates announced that they bought a minority stake in AVG Technologies for more than US$200 million.[17] On April 2010, AVG announced the appointed of security industry veteran Yuval Ben-Itzhak as senior vice president of engineering. Ben-Itzhak became the Chief Technology Officer later that year. On 9 June 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of North Carolina-based Walling Data, a North America security software distribution that has distributed AVG offerings across the United States since 2001[18] On 10 November 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based DroidSecurity, a company that specializes in the field of mobile security solutions, for Android devices. Upon completion of the acquisition DroidSecurity will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AVG and DroidSecurity CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team.[19] In December 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue.[20]
On 28 January 2011, a dangerous rogue appeared. The interface and graphics resemble the previous version of the software and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems. The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]
In 2011 the group was restructured again. AVG Technologies Holdings B.V. was founded, having AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and AVG Technologies, N.V. as its subsidiaries. On 7 February 2012 AVG Technologies, N.V. was listed on New York Stock Exchange. On 12 June 2013, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Level Platforms.[24]
March 8, 2013 JR Smith, CEO, tendered his resignation from AVG after eight years as CEO and leading the company to a successful IPO on the NYSE and delivering eight quarters of successive high-growth. On 30 July 2013, AVG Technologies announced Gary Kovacs as the company's new CEO.[25]
In November 2014, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Norman Safeground ASA, an Oslo-based company known for their Norman suite of security products.[26] AVG Technologies announced in May 2015 the acquisition of Privax a UK based company which is an owner of HideMyAss VPN service.[27] In September 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Location Labs, a company with personal security products on all four major US cellular carriers.[28]
On 7 July 2016, Avast Software announced that it intended to acquire AVG Technologies for a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, for a total of around $1.3 billion.[3] The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2016 and Avast and AVG operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.[4] The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.[29]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

History[edit]
Company was founded in Brno, Czech Republic by Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer in 1991 as GRISOFT /C/ SOFTWARE, spol. s r. o.. It was owned by Jan Gritzbach.
In 2001, Jan Gritzbach decided to sell Grisoft to Benson Oak Capital Acquisitions. Holding company Grisoft, Inc. based in Wilmington, Delaware was used for the transaction. In 2002 the company was renamed to GRISOFT, s.r.o.. Three years later, Benson Oak sold a 65% share in the company to Intel Capital and Enterprise Investors for US$52 million.[5][6][7] Holding company was Grisoft Holdings B.V. based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, later Grisoft International B.V., that gradually became the main company.
On 19 April 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company ewido Networks, an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.[8][9] On 6 November 2006, Microsoft announced that AVG Security products would be available directly from the Windows Security Center in Windows Vista.[10] Since 7 June 2006, the AVG software has also been used as an optional component of GFI MailSecurity, produced by GFI Software.[11] On 5 December 2007, Grisoft announced the acquisition of Exploit Prevention Labs, developer of the LinkScanner safe surfing technology.[12]
In 2008 GRISOFT, s.r.o. was renamed to AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and Grisoft International B.V. to AVG Technologies, N.V.. This change was made to increase the effectiveness of their marketing activities.[13] In January 2009, AVG announced their plans to acquire Sana Security were finalized. Plans to integrate Sana's technologies in their free consumer product, AVG Anti-Virus, are still under consideration, according to JR Smith, AVG's chief executive. Sana Security's developed technologies are currently licensed to Symantec.[14][15][16] On 5 October 2009, TA Associates announced that they bought a minority stake in AVG Technologies for more than US$200 million.[17] On April 2010, AVG announced the appointed of security industry veteran Yuval Ben-Itzhak as senior vice president of engineering. Ben-Itzhak became the Chief Technology Officer later that year. On 9 June 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of North Carolina-based Walling Data, a North America security software distribution that has distributed AVG offerings across the United States since 2001[18] On 10 November 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based DroidSecurity, a company that specializes in the field of mobile security solutions, for Android devices. Upon completion of the acquisition DroidSecurity will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AVG and DroidSecurity CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team.[19] In December 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue.[20]
On 28 January 2011, a dangerous rogue appeared. The interface and graphics resemble the previous version of the software and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems. The malware also contains the Internet Explorer emergency mode.[21][22] On 1 December 2011, AVG Technologies announced its acquisition of Bsecure Technologies Inc. (Bsecure), a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based technology in the Internet filtering industry since 2001, and the most endorsed software provider for family online safety.[23]
In 2011 the group was restructured again. AVG Technologies Holdings B.V. was founded, having AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o. and AVG Technologies, N.V. as its subsidiaries. On 7 February 2012 AVG Technologies, N.V. was listed on New York Stock Exchange. On 12 June 2013, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Level Platforms.[24]
March 8, 2013 JR Smith, CEO, tendered his resignation from AVG after eight years as CEO and leading the company to a successful IPO on the NYSE and delivering eight quarters of successive high-growth. On 30 July 2013, AVG Technologies announced Gary Kovacs as the company's new CEO.[25]
In November 2014, AVG Technologies announced the acquisition of Norman Safeground ASA, an Oslo-based company known for their Norman suite of security products.[26] AVG Technologies announced in May 2015 the acquisition of Privax a UK based company which is an owner of HideMyAss VPN service.[27] In September 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Location Labs, a company with personal security products on all four major US cellular carriers.[28]
On 7 July 2016, Avast Software announced that it intended to acquire AVG Technologies for a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, for a total of around $1.3 billion.[3] The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2016 and Avast and AVG operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.[4] The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.[29]

Partnerships[edit]
On 20 August 2010 AVG entered into partnership with Moka5 to secure desktop virtualisation solutions. The partnership adds a critical security layer to the virtual desktop marketplace, as more enterprise companies are turning to desktop virtualization as a secure solution for bringing your own computer (BYOC) and work from home initiatives for employees.[32]
On 1 July 2010 AVG partnered with Opera Software to provide malware security in their web browser Opera, the protection was added to the existing Fraud Protection technology (Netcraft and PhishTank from Haute Secure).[33]
In July 2011, AVG joined forces with Israeli company Zbang to launch Multimi, a free Windows and iPad app that integrates e-mail, social media and multimedia in one interface. AVG provides Linkscanner for the app, checking each link that is sent through e-mail, shared on a social network, or found via search.[34]
In December 2012, AVG and Yahoo! partnered for the Secure Search toolbar. In September 2013, AVG partnered with Facebook to launch Facebook's privacy application: AVG Crowd Control. In September 2015, AVG partnered with the Slovenian company XLAB d.o.o[35] to integrate ISL Online (desktop sharing technology) into AVG Business Managed Workplace 9.2[36] (remote monitoring and management software) in order to give Managed Services Providers the ability to easily access and control an unlimited number of unattended remote computers. In July 6, AVG Business CloudCare integrated ISL Light Client. This replaced the outgoing Remote IT Product.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2012, AVG Technologies issued a copyright claim, referred to as a 'takedown request,' for a YouTube video of 1987 pop song Never Gonna Give You Up, performed by British singer Rick Astley.[37][38][39][40] The video, which as of October 2015, has over 150 million views and 300,000 comments, had been uploaded in 2007,[41] and was restored within 24 hours by YouTube.[37][38][39][40] The video's name refers to the internet meme commonly referred to as 'Rickrolling,' where someone pranks others by tricking them into going to the video.
AVG's browser add-on, AVG Secure Search, has been criticized as being adware,[42] since it is frequently bundled with other software and is often mistakenly installed, and exhibits malware-like behavior. AVG Secure Search is also advertised to users of the free versions of AVG products.[43] Although the add-on offers legitimate malware-blocking capabilities, the default behavior of changing the internet browser's default search engine, homepage, and new tab page to AVG Secure Search is reminiscent of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), problems uninstalling the add-on have been widely reported,[42] and the add-on could potentially make an internet browser more vulnerable to attacks.[44]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
