Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh Key Developments

Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh Announces Unaudited Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended Mar. 31, 2017
Apr 27 17
Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended Mar. 31, 2017. The bank reported net income of $86.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $56.5 million for the first quarter of 2016.  This $30.3 million increase was driven by higher net interest income and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher other expense. Net interest income was $108.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, up $26.9 million compared to $81.4 million in the first quarter of 2016. Higher net interest income was primarily due to higher interest income on advances and investment securities. Total retained earnings at March 31, 2017, were $1.0 billion, up $45.2 million from $986.2 million at December 31, 2016.  Total retained earnings at March 31, 2017 included $231.9 million of restricted retained earnings compared with $214.5 million of restricted retained earnings at December 31, 2016.
