Our investment strategy is based on these principles:

 
CIVILIZATION IS THE ULTIMATE INVESTMENT
 

   

Owning the world provides downside protection and captures upside potential. Over the last 20 years, the world’s public assets grew robustly, despite volatility of various financial bubbles, major natural disasters and regional conflicts. We build strategies that mirror the entire world’s allocation of stocks and bonds. We strive to eliminate the risks of market timing and costs of excessive turnover.




 
Taxes are the greatest cost to an investor
 

   

Minimizing taxes can be more effective than trying to beat the market. With tax rates approaching 50%, our goal is to eliminate tax realizations for our clients. We use our technology to maximize our clients’ returns on an after tax basis and leverage tax-deferred and non-taxable accounts to their greatest potential.




 
Transparency provides the best financial security
 

   

The hidden costs of investing create conflicts of interest and excessive risk. We believe our incentives should align with our clients. Our management fee is the only way we are compensated. We do not use third party mutual fund managers or receive any brokerage commissions. Our reporting is completely transparent and we endeavor to eliminate any excess costs.

Our investment strategy is based on these principles:

 
CIVILIZATION IS THE ULTIMATE INVESTMENT
 

   

Owning the world provides downside protection and captures upside potential. Over the last 20 years, the world’s public assets grew robustly, despite volatility of various financial bubbles, major natural disasters and regional conflicts. We build strategies that mirror the entire world’s allocation of stocks and bonds. We strive to eliminate the risks of market timing and costs of excessive turnover.




 
Taxes are the greatest cost to an investor
 

   

Minimizing taxes can be more effective than trying to beat the market. With tax rates approaching 50%, our goal is to eliminate tax realizations for our clients. We use our technology to maximize our clients’ returns on an after tax basis and leverage tax-deferred and non-taxable accounts to their greatest potential.




 
Transparency provides the best financial security
 

   

The hidden costs of investing create conflicts of interest and excessive risk. We believe our incentives should align with our clients. Our management fee is the only way we are compensated. We do not use third party mutual fund managers or receive any brokerage commissions. Our reporting is completely transparent and we endeavor to eliminate any excess costs.
