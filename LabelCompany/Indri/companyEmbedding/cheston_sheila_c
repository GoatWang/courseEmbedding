  LOS ANGELES, June 8, 2010  -- Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) announced today that its board of directors has elected Sheila C. Cheston, corporate vice president and general counsel effective August 30, 2010. Cheston succeeds Stephen D. Yslas who is retiring Dec. 31, 2010. In her new role, Cheston will be responsible for oversight of all of the company's legal matters. She will report to Wes Bush, the company's chief executive officer and president, and become a member of the company's Corporate Policy Council.
 

  To facilitate an orderly transition process, Yslas will step down as general counsel on August 29, 2010 and continue as a corporate vice president with the company until his retirement date.

"She brings broad-based legal and strategic expertise to her new position, including many years as a senior executive in the aerospace industry and in government. She will play a significant role in our drive to improve performance and deliver value for our shareholders, customers and employees."
 

  "Steve Yslas has provided outstanding leadership in the corporation's Law Department over the past 34 years," said Bush. "We thank him for his many contributions to our company's growth and success from a $1.5 billion aircraft manufacturer in the 1970s to a $34 billion global security leader today.  We wish him well in retirement, and appreciate his continued support through this leadership transition."
 

  Cheston joins Northrop Grumman from BAE Systems, Inc., where she is a member of its board of directors and serves as the executive vice president, responsible for strategy and planning, finance, mergers and acquisitions, and all legal matters associated with BAE Systems Inc. Prior to joining BAE Systems, Cheston was a partner at the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, where she was chair of the firm's International Aviation, Defense and Aerospace Group.
 

  Cheston has held key leadership positions in the U.S. Government, including general counsel of the United States Air Force and special associate counsel to the President of the United States.
 

  Cheston earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College and a Juris Doctor degree from Columbia University School of Law.  She is a fellow of the American Bar and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  Cheston also serves on the Board of Advisors, National Military Family Association, and the Board of Directors, Organization for International Investment.

From April 1994 through September 1994, Cheston was Special Associate Counsel to President of the United States Bill Clinton.[3] She was General Counsel of the Air Force from March 1995 to October 1998.[3]
Upon leaving government service, Cheston became a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, where she chaired the firm's international aviation, defense, and aerospace group. In 2003, she became general counsel of BAE Systems, a position she held until 2009, when she became Executive Vice President.[4] She moved to rival Northrop Grumman in June 2010, becoming Northrop Grumman's general counsel.[3]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
