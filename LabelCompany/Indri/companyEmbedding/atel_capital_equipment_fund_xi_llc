ATEL CAPITAL EQUIPMENT FUND XI, LLC
 
                          
SELECTED DEALERS AGREEMENT
 
 
                           
San Francisco, California
 
                               
___________, 200_
 
Gentlemen:
 
        
The undersigned, ATEL Securities Corporation (the "Dealer
Manager"),
has entered into an agreement (the "Selling
Agreement") with ATEL CAPITAL
EQUIPMENT FUND XI, LLC, a California
limited liability company (the "Fund") and
the Manager, ATEL Financial Services, LLC
(the "Manager") pursuant to which the
undersigned has agreed to use its best
efforts to form and manage, as Dealer
Manager, a group of securities dealers (the
"Soliciting Dealers") for the
purpose of soliciting offers for the
purchase of units of limited liability
company interest ("Units") in the Fund. The
terms of the offering are set forth
in the Fund's Registration Statement No.
333-__________, on Form S-1 which was
filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"1933 Act"). Such registration
statement in the form in which it became
effective is referred to herein as the
"Registration Statement" and the prospectus
included therein, in the form in
which it became effective and in the form
as first filed with the Commission
pursuant to its Rule 424, is referred to
herein as the "Prospectus." The terms
used but not otherwise defined in this
Agreement have the same meanings as in
the Prospectus.
 
        
You are invited to become one of the Soliciting Dealers and by
your
confirmation hereof you agree to act in
such capacity and to use your best
efforts, in accordance with the following
terms and conditions, to find
purchasers for the Units. You hereby
confirm that you are a member in good
standing of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD").
 
        
l. You hereby agree to solicit, as an independent contractor and
not as
our agent or as an agent of the Fund or the
Manager, persons acceptable to the
Manager to enter into the Subscription
Agreement in the form attached to the
Prospectus. Until such time as subscription
proceeds for a total of not less
than 120,000 Units are received, accepted
and deposited with the escrow agent,
all subscription checks shall be payable to
"U. S. Bank - ACEF XI Escrow." All
Subscription Agreements solicited by you
shall be transmitted promptly to the
Dealer Manager in accordance with the
instructions set forth in the Subscription
Agreements, and all funds received by you
with respect to any Subscription
Agreement shall be promptly transmitted to
the Dealer Manager. As used herein
the term "promptly transmitted" shall have
the meaning set forth in Rule 15c2-4
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "1934 Act"), as interpreted in
NASD Notice to Members 84-64. You hereby
agree to comply in full with such NASD
Notice to Members 84-64, as it may be
amended from time to time. We in turn will
transmit subscriptions and funds received
during the escrow period to the escrow
agent not later than noon of the second
business day following receipt of same
by us. After subscriptions for a minimum of
120,000 Units have been received,
accepted and deposited with the escrow
agent, and subscription proceeds are
thereafter released to the Fund pursuant to
the terms of the escrow agreement,
all further subscription checks shall be
payable directly to the Fund. No
Subscription Agreement shall be effective
unless and until accepted by the
Manager, and in no event will a
subscription be effective until five days after
the investor has received a Prospectus.
 
        
You agree that you will:
 
                 
(a) (i) diligently make inquiries as required by law of all
                 
prospective investors in order to ascertain whether a purchase
                  
of Units is suitable for the investors and (ii) inform each
                 
prospective investor of all pertinent facts relating to the
                 
liquidity and marketability of the Units during the term of
                 
the investment;
 
 
 
                                      
1
<PAGE>
 
 
 
                 
(b) have reasonable grounds to believe, on the basis of
                 
information obtained from the participant concerning his
                 
investment objectives, other investments, financial situation
                 
and needs, and any other information known by you, that:
 
                                   
(i) the participant is or will be in a
                          
financial position appropriate to enable him to
                          
realize to a significant extent the benefits
                          
described in the Prospectus;
 
                                   
(ii) the participant has a fair market net
                          
worth sufficient to sustain the risks inherent in the
                          
program, including loss of investment and lack of
                          
liquidity; and
 
                                   
(iii) the program is otherwise suitable for
                  
        
the participant;
 
                 
(c) maintain copies of all Subscription Agreements and
                 
information relating to suitability determinations in your
                 
records for the longer of (i) six years from the date of
                  
investment, (ii) the period prescribed by Rule 17a-4 under the
                 
1934 Act, or (iii) the period required by applicable state
                 
blue sky laws;
 
                 
(d) execute no transaction in a discretionary account without
                 
prior written approval of the transaction by the investor; and
 
                 
(e) comply in all respects with the Conduct Rules of the NASD
                 
in the conduct of the offering of Units.
 
        
Furthermore, you expressly agree to be bound by the escrow
agreement
executed by the Fund for the deposit of
subscription proceeds pending receipt
and acceptance of subscriptions for a
minimum of 120,000 Units.
 
        
All subscriptions solicited by you will be strictly subject to
confirmation by us and acceptance thereof
by the Fund and we, the Fund and the
Manager, reserve the right in our and its
uncontrolled discretion to reject any
such subscription and to accept or reject
subscriptions in the order of their
receipt by the Fund or otherwise. A sale of
a Unit shall be deemed to be
completed only after (i) the Fund receives
a properly completed subscription
agreement from the Soliciting Dealer,
together with payment of the full purchase
price of each purchased Unit from a buyer
who satisfies each of the terms and
conditions of the Registration Statement
and Prospectus; (ii) a period of five
days has passed following the receipt by
the investor of a Prospectus; and (iii)
such subscription agreement has been
accepted in writing by the Manager. Neither
you nor any other person is authorized to
give any information or make any
representation other than those contained
in the Prospectus or in any
supplemental sales literature furnished by
the Dealer Manager or the Fund for
use in making solicitations in connection
with the offer and sale of the Units.
 
        
Upon release by us, you may offer the Units at the public
offering
price, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof.
 
        
2. We understand that the Fund will provide you with such number
of
copies of the enclosed Prospectus and such
number of copies of amendments and
supplements thereto as you may reasonably
request. In this connection, the Fund
and the Manager have represented and
warranted to us that the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus, and all
amendments or supplements thereto, will
contain all statements which are required
to be stated therein in accordance
with the 1933 Act and the Rules and
Regulations thereunder, and neither the
Registration Statement nor the Prospectus,
nor any amendment or supplement
thereto, will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit any
material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading. It is understood by
the Fund and the Manager that
Section (b)(3) of Rule 2810 of the Conduct
Rules of the NASD requires that you
determine that all material facts relating
to the subject offering are
 
 
 
                                      
2
<PAGE>
 
adequately and accurately disclosed to
prospective subscribers and provide a
basis for evaluating the offering, and the
Fund and the Manager therefore have
specifically represented and warranted to
us that:
 
        
(a) all items of compensation payable to them and their affiliates
are
        
and will be set forth in the Prospectus under the caption
"Management
        
Compensation";
 
        
(b) all types of Equipment to be acquired by the Fund are and will
be
        
described in the Prospectus under the caption "Investment
Objectives
        
and Policies - Types of Equipment" or in a supplement to be
included
        
inside the back cover of the Prospectus;
 
        
(c) all material tax aspects are and will be set forth in the
        
Prospectus under the captions "Income Tax Consequences" and
"Risk
        
Factors";
 
        
(d) the financial position and business experience of the Manager
and
        
of those affiliates of the Manager who are of relevance to the
subject
        
offering are and will be accurately and adequately reflected in
the
        
Prospectus under the captions "Management" and "Prior
Performance
        
Summary";
 
        
(e) all material conflicts of interest and risk factors are and
will be
        
set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Conflicts of
Interest"
        
and "Risk Factors"; and
 
        
(f) all pertinent facts relating to the liquidity and marketability
of
        
the Units are and will be set forth in the Prospectus under the
        
captions "Risk Factors - Limited Transferability of Units" and
"Summary
        
of the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement -
Transferability
        
of Units."
 
        
We also understand that the Fund may provide you with certain
supplemental sales material to be used by
you in connection with the
solicitation of Units in the Fund. We will
comply with the filing requirements
of Section 2210(c)(2) of the NASD Conduct
rules with respect to any
advertisements or sales literature to be
used as supplemental sales material in
connection with the solicitation of Units.
You agree not to use any
advertisement or sales literature, as those
terms are defined in Section 2210(a)
of the NASD Conduct Rules, as supplemental
sales literature in the solicitation
of Units except to the extent such
materials are provided by us or we have given
our prior written approval for use of such
materials. In the event you elect to
use supplemental sales material, you agree
that such material shall not be used
in connection with the solicitations of
Units unless accompanied or preceded by
the Prospectus as then currently in effect
and as it may be amended or
supplemented in the future, unless you are
notified by us that such material has
been prepared and cleared for use in
compliance with the SEC's Rule 134. Upon
your request, we will furnish to you
information necessary to confirm the
continued fairness, accuracy, and
completeness of the Prospectus in all material
respects during the offering period.
 
        
We shall have full authority to take such action as we may deem
advisable in respect of all matters
pertaining to the offering. We shall be
under no liability to you except for lack
of good faith and for obligations
expressly assumed by us in this Agreement.
Nothing contained in this paragraph
is intended to operate as, and the
provisions of this paragraph shall not
constitute, a waiver by you of compliance
with any provision of the 1933 Act, or
of the rules and regulations
thereunder.
 
        
You confirm that you are familiar with Securities Act Release No.
4968
and Rule l5c2-8 under the 1934 Act,
relating to the distribution of preliminary
and final prospectuses, and confirm that
you have complied and will comply
therewith. We will make available to you,
to the extent they are made available
to us by the Fund, such number of copies of
the Prospectus as you may reasonably
request for the purposes contemplated by
the 1933 Act and the applicable rules
and regulations thereunder.
 
        
You agree that you will exercise due diligence in determining that
all
material facts are adequately and
accurately disclosed in the Prospectus. For
purposes of compliance with Sections
(b)(3)(A) and (B) of Rule 2810 of the
Conduct Rules of the NASD regarding due
diligence, it is understood and agreed
that you may rely upon the results of an
inquiry conducted by another member or
members of the NASD, provided that:
 
 
                                      
3
<PAGE>
 
                 
(i) you have reasonable grounds to believe that such inquiry
        
was conducted with due care;
 
                 
(ii) the results of the inquiry were provided to you with the
        
consent of the member or members conducting or directing the
inquiry;
        
and
 
                 
(iii) no member that participated in the inquiry is a sponsor
        
of the Fund or an Affiliate of such sponsor.
 
        
3. We will be entitled to receive from the Fund a selling
commission
equal to 9% of the Gross Proceeds. For your
services hereunder, subject to the
condition that Subscription Agreements for
a minimum of 120,000 Units have been
received and accepted by the Manager by the
termination date of the offering,
you will receive from us a selling
commission equal to 7.5% of the proceeds from
all Subscription Agreements solicited by
you and accepted by the Manager. It is
understood and agreed that no reimbursement
will be made for any due diligence
expenses unless they represent bona fide
due diligence expenses incurred by you,
such expenses are documented by itemized
invoice and such invoice is delivered
to us by the earlier of a date 90 days
after notice of termination of the
offering of Units or a date two years from
the date the offering commences.
 
        
In the event that a sale of Units for which you have solicited
a
Subscription Agreement shall not occur,
whether by reason of the failure of any
condition specified herein or in the
Subscription Agreement or the Selling
Agreement, rejection of the subscription by
the Fund or otherwise, no payment
with respect to such Unit shall be made to
you. Further, it is understood and
agreed that we shall be under no obligation
to make payment to you, and you
expressly waive payment, of any commission
hereunder except to the extent that
we shall have first received from the Fund
the selling commission to which we
are entitled in connection with the subject
transaction. Any payment to you will
be payable only with respect to
transactions lawful in the jurisdictions where
they occur.
 
        
We as Dealer Manager may, in our discretion, permit the Manager,
a
Soliciting Dealer or any Affiliate or
employee of any of the foregoing or
certain clients of registered investment
advisors to purchase Units net of the
7.5% retail selling commissions at a per
Unit price of $9.25, as more
specifically described in the Prospectus
under "Plan of Distribution -
Investments by Certain Persons." Any such
sale of Units net of retail
commissions will only be permitted if and
to the extent that the Soliciting
Dealer which would otherwise be entitled to
a selling commission on any such
transaction agrees to such terms.
Therefore, we will by separate letter
agreement establish the amount of selling
commission, if any, on transactions
for which you would otherwise be entitled
to the full selling commission, but
which are eligible for the reduction. It
shall be your responsibility
