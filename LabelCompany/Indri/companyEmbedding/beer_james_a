For more than half a century James Bond has always drunk Vodka Martinis - 'shaken, not stirred'.But now Bond actor Daniel Craig has swapped his traditional beverage for a bottle of Heineken as he stars in a controversial new advert.Although the movies have long been filmed with carefully placed products, by filming a standalone advert 007 has gone a stage further.The ad, which also promotes the new Bond film Skyfall, is part of a £28million tie in with the Dutch brewer.

Neither shaken, nor stirred: Bond, played by Daniel Craig, drinks a bottle of Heineken with co-star Berenice Marlohe
   



Controversial: The £28 million product placement deal with Heineken in the new film Skyfall was needed, Daniel Craig said, for the film to be made
James Bond has previously flashed an 
Omega watch in a commercial - but now he has swapped his traditional drink to promote a lager.He is also seen drinking Heineken in the new movie out next month.Bond has been forced to tout himself to the highest bidders as the film-makers MGM have tackled financial difficulties.It is four years since Quantum of Solace was released and the shooting of Skyfall was delayed two years ago because of funding problems.Daniel Craig appears alongside Berenice Marlohe in the advert and he said the film would not have been completed if the beer tie-in had not been agreed.

'We have relationships with a number of companies so that we can make this movie,' Daniel Craig told website Moviefone.'The simple fact is that, without them, we couldn't do it. It's unfortunate but that's how it is. This movie costs a lot of money to make, it costs nearly as much again if not more to promote, so we go where we can.  



Bond girl: Berenice Marlohe, who appears in the new film Skyfall, in the advert
   



Chase: James Bond is pursued by a group of villains on a snowy train station platform at the start of the commercial
 
 'The great thing is that Bond is a 
drinker, he always has been, it's part of who he is, rightly or wrongly,
 you can make your own judgement about it, having a beer is no bad 
thing, in the movie it just happens to be Heineken.'Bond has always drunk Vodka Martinis 
'shaken, not stirred' since the line appeared in Ian Fleming's 
1956 novel Diamonds are Forever.The film makers insist he has drunk beer in the past so remains true to his routes, and he will still be seen drinking a Vodka Martini in the upcoming movie.In the commercial, as Bond sneaks his way onto the train
 the unfortunate commuter is chased by the villains and Daniel Craig gets himself a Heineken at the bar.
The the very first Bond bad guy - the 
sinister Dr No portrayed by the late Joseph Wiseman - also turns up as a 
passenger thanks to some CGI wizadry.
At the end of the advert, Bond parachutes out of the train to the classic Bond theme tune.Skyfall is one of the most hotly anticipated films of 2012 and opens in cinemas nationwide on October 26. It is has been four years since the last film Quantum of Solace. 



Mr Bond, we'd been expecting you... to have a Vodka Martini: Daniel Craig holds his Heineken. He has always drunk Vodka Martinis 'shaken, not stirred' since 1956

Tradition: Daniel Craig drinks a Vodka Martini in the last James Bond film Quantum of Solace which was out four years ago

American Beauty director Sam Mendes 
is at the helm and Oscar-winner Javier Bardem stars as villain Raoul 
Silva while Dame Judi Dench returns as spy chief M.
The new Heineken commercial begins with a pursuit of James Bond at a train station covered in snow.
The secret agent bumps into a man wearing the same clothes and the villains mistake him for the spy.
The Bond girls are played by Marlohe 
and Naomie Harris in Skyfall which also stars Ralph Fiennes, Albert 
Finney and Ben Wishaw as the new Q.

James Hinchcliffe's Beer Is the Best Driver-Endorsed Product
If your choice is a t-shirt or a beer, you'd choose the beer.








Flat12 

















By
					Marshall Pruett




					Mar 25, 2016
				


























Racecar drivers would love nothing more than to have you buy some of the nonsense that bears their names. The endless array of branded garbage is designed to lighten your wallet and, if we're honest, the t-shirt or mementos you take home are only going to be recycled, donated to a second-hand store, or hit the landfill before the end of the decade.

Whether it's paying $24.95 for a stuffed animal replica of NASCAR star Danica Patrick's dog "Dallas," or forking out $10.61 for three golf balls imprinted with the name of two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso, it's likely they will soon be forgotten or lost after arrival.It makes the latest offering from IndyCar driver James "The Mayor of Hinchtown" Hinchcliffe the most practical—and possibly the most pleasing—of the bunch. The Canadian's Hinchtown Hammerdown pilsner, which was only available onsite at the Flat12 Bierwerks in Indianapolis, is now available in cans. A new brew, The Bricks, will go on sale in May to celebrate the 100th running of the Indy 500, and will only be available at Flat12."Merchandise has been around forever, and serves its purpose, but the world is evolving, as is the world of branded driver goods, and that's what we have with Hammerdown," Hinchcliffe told RoadandTrack.com. "And once you're done, you can keep the cans!"

The Toronto native is also enthused over The Bricks, which, in an abstract manner, incorporates the Indy 500's theme of providing its winners with a bottle of milk to drink in Victory Lane."When creating the beer four years ago, we decided to go with a lager, an easy-drinking beer for a day at the track," Hinchcliffe said. "We've created a great brew, but for the 100th year celebration, we wanted to go even bigger. So at the beginning of May we will release my second Flat12 collaboration beer, The Bricks-- a Red IPA brewed with milk sugar, in honor of a great tradition in motorsports."




















Flat12 

And no, The Bricks isn't The Mayor's attempt to sell milk-beer."It's a ruddy brown color—a full-body IPA," he added. "The milk sugar is just that; it's sugar, not milk, and it just adds body."Racecars drivers selling their own beer. . . that's the kind of merchandise I can get behind.

James Bond's 007 Special Blend cans feature beautiful women posing in front of famous London backdrops



During the 1960s spy boom, many products including clothing and accessories, were branded with James Bond or 007. One of the more fascinating items is the James Bond's 007 Special Blend. This blend of malt liquor and beer was produced in 1968 by the National Brewing Company of Baltimore, Maryland. National, which also owned plants in Detroit, Miami, and Phoenix, is better known for Colt 45 malt liquor and National Bohemian beer.The James Bond's 007 Special Blend cans featured attractive women posing in front of famous London backdrops. The brand was pulled when National Brewing learned that it might have been a good idea to check with the estate of Ian Fleming about using its trademarks for a commercial product. The cans are highly valued by collectors, and currently can fetch more than $500.Bond and beer is not a strange connection in itself. He has enjoyed a beer on several occasions, in the Ian Fleming novels particularly. Beer brands enjoyed by Bond include Löwenbräu, Miller High Life and Red Stripe.

Beer Product - Brewery - James Clay









Anchor Steam Beer

	The classic of American brewing tradition since 1896, Anchor Steam has a deep bronze colour with a thick creamy head. The palate is full and malty with a beautiful bitter hop aroma - a unique beer universally recognised as a world classic that traces back to the Gold Rush era.


ABV:
4.8%


Size (Bottles):
24 x 355ml


Draught:
19.5 litre keg (American Sankey Coupler)


Style:
California Common











Liberty Ale

	The champagne-like bubbles, distinctive hop bouquet and balanced character of Liberty Ale® revives old brewing traditions that are now more relevant than ever. First introduced in 1975, Anchor Liberty Ale® was the first American IPA brewed after prohibition. Furthermore, it was the first modern dry hopped ale in the US and was the beer that popularised the Cascade hop.


ABV:
5.9%


Size (Bottles):
24 x 355ml


Size (Cans):
24 x 355ml


Style:
IPA











California Lager

	Anchor Steam's roots go back to the Gold Rush, long before icehouses and modern refrigeration made traditional lagers a viable California option. In 1876, thanks to an ice pond in the mountains and a belief that anything is possible in the Golden State, a little brewery named Boca created California's first genuine lager. Anchor California Lager is Anchor's re-creation of this historic beer.


ABV:
4.9%


Size (Bottles):
24 x 355ml


Size (Cans):
24 x 355ml

Anchor Porter

	With deep black colour, a thick, creamy head, rich chocolate, toffee and coffee flavours, and full-bodied smoothness, Anchor Porter is the epitome of a handcrafted dark beer and a classic of the porter style.


ABV:
5.6%


Size (Bottles):
24 x 355ml


Style:
American Porter











Anchor Go West! IPA

	The California Gold Rush compelled thousands to Go West! “to see the elephant,” a metaphor for the doggedly optimistic risk-taking linked then and now with America’s intensified pursuit of happiness. This brew pours bright, clear golden color with light tan head, has strong tropical and citrus fruit aromas balanced by the spiky freshness of pine needles. You get bitterness up front followed by subtly sweet maltiness, a light body and very smooth finish. 


ABV:
6.7%


Size (Bottles):
24 x 355ml


Size (Cans):
24 x 355ml


Draught:
19.5 litre keg (American Sankey Coupler)

Not even Daniel Craig’s clenched thespian gravitas can gloss over the fact that James Bond has got a licence to sell, and he will basically flog whatever he’s told to. Bond films now attract the same type of sponsorship as the World Cup or the Olympics. Skyfall had deals with Coca-Cola, Sony, Ford, Omega, Procter & Gamble and Heineken. But do these brands really get their money’s worth? You’d think so, considering the recent news that Belvedere vodka has paid an undisclosed sum to be featured in the upcoming Spectre. It has already launched limited-edition bottles with the MI6 building engraved on them, and LED lights inside them. The film isn’t out for a year and already we’re talking about Belvedere vodka, so there is your marketing impact right there. Or rather, right here.
But the real beneficiaries of the 007 touch are often the smaller brands that get a free ride in the movies. Heineken paid £28m for the Skyfall tie-in, for example, but fans were horrified at the prospect of Bond chugging beer. Even Craig described the deal as “unfortunate”, thus generating reams of negative publicity. For which Heineken then compensated with a carpet-marketing campaign – bombarding us with expensive commercials (starring Craig), mobile apps, branded bottles, advertising in stores, online, in print and so on, until nobody ever wanted to see a Heineken bottle again.
Bond obediently swigged the beer for one early scene, but after that what did he drink? Macallan whisky. So did Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. And what did Macallan pay for the privilege? Nothing at all. Macallan didn’t even ask to be in the movie – the film-makers approached them. According to one estimate, Macallan accounted for 7% of all product-placement screen time in Skyfall, which brought the company some $7m (£4.4m) worth of exposure, and doubtless cost a few Heineken execs their jobs.
It’s the same with other Bond accoutrements. Everyone knows Bond’s weapon of choice: a Walther PPK. Bond has been its screen-to-screen salesman for 50 years. Sean Connery even presented a short documentary on Walther guns in the 1960s. And yet the arms dealer pays nothing for the privilege – it was all thanks to Ian Fleming’s decision to equip Bond with the gun back in 1956. Bond is happy to advertise other weapons too, mind you. In Skyfall, he also used an Anderson Wheeler shotgun, and again the gunmakers paid nothing, but they duly capitalised with a “Skyfall Edition” 0.500 rifle. Starting price: around £16,000.
It’s amazing what Bond gets away with selling: alcohol, firearms, tobacco, oil companies, fast food. He would probably do GM crops too if they could work it into the script. But the truth is, off-duty, he is an incorrigible shopaholic. Between missions, he is scouring Mayfair arcades and designer sample sales seeking to satiate his unchecked desire for luxury items. If you are a purveyor of such goods, you are in with a good chance of some free publicity, it seems. But let’s not forget who is really footing the bill for this government employee-turned-rogue consumer. Why do you think we have a deficit problem?

Product placement in pictures: SkyfallNovember 4, 2012|In movies|By Erik







A lot has been written about excessive and blatant product placement in the latest Bond movie Skyfall. But let me say somethingdifferent: product placement in Skyfall wasn’t excessive and wasn’t blatant. Actually it was more subtle than I’ve expected. Mind you, we’re still talking about James Bond movie, so there is a lot of products and brands integrated in the movie, but Skyfall is no Transformers or some other examples of product placement prostitution.
When the information about Heineken’s $45 million deal (roughly a third of Skyfall’s production budget) first surfaced, there were numerous articles and blog posts about James Bond selling out. We have to be honest, though. All Bond’s movies had product placement, some were more subtle and some were more blatant when it comes to brand integration. Also, David Leigh who runs website The James Bond Dossier said, that Bond has consumed a wide variety of beverages from the start, in both in his literary and cinematic incarnations.
So, what’s the fuss?
First, let’s check products and brands from Skyfall. [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]
Cars: Landrover, Audi, Beetle, Range Rover, Jaguar and Aston Martin
Landrover Defender and Audi were seen in a car chase scene: Eve drove Landrover, while the bad guys tried to escape in Audi. During the chase a few VW Beetles fell from the train.
Range Rover was used to transport Bond to MI6’s new location and M and Bond used Jaguar XJ.
The legendary Aston Martin DB5 also made an important appearance, but I won’t reveal why :)
Aston Martin DB5 from Skyfall
Sony 
Skyfall was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures. Columbia Pictures is owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, so the appearance of different Sony products should not be a coincidence. I have reviewed several movies, distributed by Sony Pictures and probably all of them included Sony’s brands.
Bond (or was it Q?) used Sony Vaio laptop (first seen in Casino Royale) and Sony Xperia T mobile phone. Nothing special or excessive there: only Vaio’s logo and a glimpse of the new Xperia.
Sony Vaio from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
Macallan whisky
Macallan whisky was probably the most “in your face” placement. It occurred during the first meeting between Bond and Silva. The main villain offered James a drink, a 50-year old Macallan, because it’s his favorite drink.
Additionally, we saw M and Bond drinking Macallan on two different occasions.
Macallan whisky (on the desk) from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
Heineken
The much hyped Heineken appeared in two scenes: Bond was lying in bed with a girl and we could see a bottle of Heineken in his hand. The other appearance was in a big office: Tanner, one of MI6 employees was sipping beer from Heineken bottle. That’s it. Nothing excessive.
Heineken in Skyfall
Omega
We know that Bond wears Omega, but I couldn’t recognize his watch. Anyway, he wore a Seamaster model.
Omega Seamaster from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
Tom Ford
James Bond has been wearing Tom Ford for the second time. Similar as with Omega you can’t recognize the brand of his clothes – the fact that we know what he wears is just matter of clever/aggressive marketing campaign(s).
Bond also wore Tom Ford Marko TF144 sunglasses.
You can read more about James Bond’s clothing in the excellent blog post at Clothes on Film.

Walther PPK
Walther PPK pistol is a longtime Bond companion, but in Skyfall Q introduced an improved gun with a thumbprint code.
Walther PPK from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
THE VERDICT
23rd Bond movie is very good. Even though Casino Royale remains my personal favorite, Skyfall is an improvement over Quantum of Solace. Also, Daniel Craig’s movies are vastly superior to Brosnan’s, Dalton’s and Moore’s. Bond is now more human and not a cartoon that would become if Pierce Brosnan stayed in his role.
Product placement used to be synonymous for Bond movies and has to be analyzed with that fact in mind. All Bond movies have got excessive product placement, but Bond was also a sexist, he delivered amusing one-lines, the majority of Bond girls had stupid names (Christmas Jones, Pussy Galore …) … to name just a few of Bond’s trademarks.
With everything taken into account, product placement in Skyfall was nicely done. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with it and I hope people will stop complaining about it.
Do you agree?

Agree 100 percent. Much to do about nothing

There was a rather needless close up of the Omega as Bond operated the Caterpillar diggar and Tanner drinking beer in the office was pretty unlikely if MI6 has gone the way of most British workplaces, but overall I agree with you.

Thanks Tom. I usually write blog posts after I watch a movie at home, but this time I went to the cinema and began writing the next day. I hoped I’d remember every brand in Skyfall, but I guess I failed :))

There was also Adidas, Bond wore these in the fitness test scene. Personally, I think the product placement in this film was tasteful and subtle, save for the VW brand (the Beetle scene was a bit much).

Most people don’t notice and don’t care about product placement! We see those products every day in real life, just like we see them in movies. It makes me wonder exactly how much the manufacturers increase sales by this, as opposed to how much it costs them to do it.

Regarding Omega again for a second it’s also worth noting that there is another example of very subtle product placement. It’s almost subliminal. During Bond’s pursuit of Silva in the subway there is an instance where Silva passes up two posters for Omega. One for the Seamaster Planet Ocean and another Seamaster model I believe. I saw Skyfall for the first time last night and picked up on this almost immediately. Very cleverly played
