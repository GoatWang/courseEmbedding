History[edit]
Founded in 2003 by Eric Smith, Will West and Mark Morgan, Control4 debuted at the CEDIA 2004 home technology trade show and released its first products later that year.[4] The company received funding from Foundation Capital, Thomas Weisel Venture Partners, Signal Peak Ventures, Frazier Technology Ventures, and Cisco Systems[5] prior to its August 2, 2013 IPO.[2][5] Current CEO Martin Plaehn joined Control4 in September 2011.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Control4’s home automation systems have been likened to an operating system for the home.[7][8] The company develops a branded line of products and services to control home lighting, multi-room audio, and HVAC systems that utilize communication protocols such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Z-Wave.[9] Control4 also supports more than 8,000 devices[10] from third-party manufacturers, including the Nest smart home thermostat, [11] CoolMasterNet for seamless integration with VRF & Split HVACs,[12] Sonos music system,[13] and products from Sony[14] and Sub-Zero.[15] For example, with Control4, a homeowner could control “the ventilation in his garage, the music streaming to speakers in multiple rooms of his home, every light, the TV, the thermostat, even the Blu-Ray player in the guest house” from an iOS device.[16]
In 2012, Control4 released its Simple Device Discovery Protocol (SDDP), which makes products embedded with the code automatically discoverable on a Control4 network.[9] The company licenses the protocol, which is similar to Universal Plug and Play,[17] to other vendors for their products (such as Sony Bravia TVs).[14]
As of January 2015, over 100 developers supported SDDP in more than 500 devices, including Panasonic, Dish Network, Bose, TiVo, Epson, Harman Kardon, Denon, Pioneer, Sony, Sharp, and Yamaha.[9][18]
As of February 2015, Control4 was selling its products through a network of 2,676 North American and 787 international authorized dealers in 88 countries.[19][20] In 2016 the following dealers were honored with 2016 Dealer of the Year Awards[21]:

Portugal – Deritec
GCC – Mega Tech

As of January 2015, over 100 developers supported SDDP in more than 500 devices, including Panasonic, Dish Network, Bose, TiVo, Epson, Harman Kardon, Denon, Pioneer, Sony, Sharp, and Yamaha.[9][18]
As of February 2015, Control4 was selling its products through a network of 2,676 North American and 787 international authorized dealers in 88 countries.[19][20] In 2016 the following dealers were honored with 2016 Dealer of the Year Awards[21]:

Spain – Arbona piza
France – Futur In Media
Portugal – Deritec
GCC – Mega Tech
Italy – Tesis
London – Aonyx
Sweden – Hages Radio TV
Switzerland – Olvision Sagl

Additionally, Control4 partners with national homebuilders, including Toll Brothers, to provide optional home automation packages to homebuyers.[22]

Company really does care about its people. As with all growing companies, there are pains but what makes this company great is that their is an attitude of "yes, we can". If you like technology, AV, Automation and Controls, Control4 is the leader in residential home systems. Lots of really great people work here and have for many, many year.ConsNo more Stock Options. 401k is now matched as of 1/1/17 (PRO). Health insurance is good but could be better. We find that is does not cover many of the regular things we need.Advice to ManagementAlways put people first! It's the people that make or break your company.

Mid management says they encourage this. However, their attitudes and actions prove otherwise.There are toxic people in this environment who seems to poison any progress of existing projects. Furthermore, it seems these people have too much clout in major decision making. Finally, the most loud and obnoxious people in a meeting room will be heard over more reasonable voices.The health benefits are sub par.Stock options have been removed as part of the benefits package.The quality of QA is terrible. This organization releases software containing known issues.The organization and its processes are in need of improvements.Mid management and project management are both questionable. There's is lack of and inconsistent vision, direction and planning.The CEO seems to care more about his image than his people, the product and the end consumer.Advice to ManagementHighly talented engineers are very difficult to find, let alone retain.

Coworkers for the most part are fun people to be around.ConsSupervisors are non-existent so many employees take advantage of that. I've had days where i did absolutely nothing for half a day and havent had a supervisor or manager ever take notice. Only 30 minutes for lunch, which is frequently taken away if we have company meetings. Complete lack of leadership in day to day work. QA of products seems subpar, there are frequently known bugs of released software or hardware but it gets pushed out to meet deadlines.Advice to ManagementPay attention to your employees and their daily habits. Forcing others to take on a higher workload because you have half your techs wasting time is ridiculous.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Control4 Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Control4 2015-10-28 14:36 PDT Dec 8, 2014 Helpful (2)"Awesome technology; Leadership that is both human and accessible"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Draper, UTCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Draper, UTRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Control4 full-time (Less than a year)ProsControl4's technology is amazing. For anyone who wants to work in technology that is actually relevant to their own lives, this may be the best place in Utah. The employee beta program allows you to outfit your own home with company gear, and many industry partners extend amazing accommodation pricing on their gear. The result is that you get to work on things you actually use, and use things you have helped to create.The other thing I love is that management here are not aloof and unreachable like so many other places I have worked. They care about customers, the company, and employees. I can talk to the CEO, VPs of R&D, Sales, or Marketing. They're in touch, and will listen to the ideas of others.ConsHaving lived too long under the start-up mindset, the company is now in a much-needed transition phase. It's becoming more focused and mature in its processes. That means it has some technical debt to pay down, and maturing to do. It's underway, but needs to happen faster.Advice to ManagementDon't allow growth to unmoor you from direct contact with the people who produce, market, sell and support the company's solutions.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Control4 Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Control4 2014-12-08 13:47 PST Showing 29 of 31 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious123NextReviews > Control4 RSS Feed</>Embed Control4 Careers Control4, a leading provider of personalized automation and control solutions, allows you to control virtually any device in a home or...    – More Work Here!

History[edit]
Founded in 2003 by Eric Smith, Will West and Mark Morgan, Control4 debuted at the CEDIA 2004 home technology trade show and released its first products later that year.[4] The company received funding from Foundation Capital, Thomas Weisel Venture Partners, Signal Peak Ventures, Frazier Technology Ventures, and Cisco Systems[5] prior to its August 2, 2013 IPO.[2][5] Current CEO Martin Plaehn joined Control4 in September 2011.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Control4’s home automation systems have been likened to an operating system for the home.[7][8] The company develops a branded line of products and services to control home lighting, multi-room audio, and HVAC systems that utilize communication protocols such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Z-Wave.[9] Control4 also supports more than 8,000 devices[10] from third-party manufacturers, including the Nest smart home thermostat, [11] CoolMasterNet for seamless integration with VRF & Split HVACs,[12] Sonos music system,[13] and products from Sony[14] and Sub-Zero.[15] For example, with Control4, a homeowner could control “the ventilation in his garage, the music streaming to speakers in multiple rooms of his home, every light, the TV, the thermostat, even the Blu-Ray player in the guest house” from an iOS device.[16]
In 2012, Control4 released its Simple Device Discovery Protocol (SDDP), which makes products embedded with the code automatically discoverable on a Control4 network.[9] The company licenses the protocol, which is similar to Universal Plug and Play,[17] to other vendors for their products (such as Sony Bravia TVs).[14]
As of January 2015, over 100 developers supported SDDP in more than 500 devices, including Panasonic, Dish Network, Bose, TiVo, Epson, Harman Kardon, Denon, Pioneer, Sony, Sharp, and Yamaha.[9][18]
As of February 2015, Control4 was selling its products through a network of 2,676 North American and 787 international authorized dealers in 88 countries.[19][20] In 2016 the following dealers were honored with 2016 Dealer of the Year Awards[21]:

EMEA – Audiotek SARL
Spain – Arbona piza
France – Futur In Media
Portugal – Deritec
GCC – Mega Tech
Italy – Tesis
London – Aonyx
Sweden – Hages Radio TV
Switzerland – Olvision Sagl
Ireland – Cloney Audio
Benelux – B&G Audio Video Solutions BV

Additionally, Control4 partners with national homebuilders, including Toll Brothers, to provide optional home automation packages to homebuyers.[22]
Proprietary products[edit]

Audio/Video - a line of audio and video distribution products for controlling entertainment throughout a home using a centralized source.[23]
Lighting - wireless, programmable lighting control systems, controlled by switches, dimmers, keypads and remote devices.[24]
HVAC - smart thermostats, compatible with most HVAC systems worldwide and remotely controllable.[25]
Touch screens - touch screens, handheld and stationary, that operate as dedicated interfaces for Control4 systems.[26]
Remote controls - Remote controls that enable control of an entire smart home system.[27]
Controllers - main device connecting and controlling the entire system.[28]
Sensors/Relays - motion and light sensors to automatically initiate actions within the system, like turning on the lights when you enter a room.[29]
Cameras - security cameras for video intercoms, or “door stations.”[30]
Networking - following the acquisition of Pakedge in March '16

History[edit]
Founded in 2003 by Eric Smith, Will West and Mark Morgan, Control4 debuted at the CEDIA 2004 home technology trade show and released its first products later that year.[4] The company received funding from Foundation Capital, Thomas Weisel Venture Partners, Signal Peak Ventures, Frazier Technology Ventures, and Cisco Systems[5] prior to its August 2, 2013 IPO.[2][5] Current CEO Martin Plaehn joined Control4 in September 2011.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Control4’s home automation systems have been likened to an operating system for the home.[7][8] The company develops a branded line of products and services to control home lighting, multi-room audio, and HVAC systems that utilize communication protocols such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Z-Wave.[9] Control4 also supports more than 8,000 devices[10] from third-party manufacturers, including the Nest smart home thermostat, [11] CoolMasterNet for seamless integration with VRF & Split HVACs,[12] Sonos music system,[13] and products from Sony[14] and Sub-Zero.[15] For example, with Control4, a homeowner could control “the ventilation in his garage, the music streaming to speakers in multiple rooms of his home, every light, the TV, the thermostat, even the Blu-Ray player in the guest house” from an iOS device.[16]
In 2012, Control4 released its Simple Device Discovery Protocol (SDDP), which makes products embedded with the code automatically discoverable on a Control4 network.[9] The company licenses the protocol, which is similar to Universal Plug and Play,[17] to other vendors for their products (such as Sony Bravia TVs).[14]
As of January 2015, over 100 developers supported SDDP in more than 500 devices, including Panasonic, Dish Network, Bose, TiVo, Epson, Harman Kardon, Denon, Pioneer, Sony, Sharp, and Yamaha.[9][18]
As of February 2015, Control4 was selling its products through a network of 2,676 North American and 787 international authorized dealers in 88 countries.[19][20] In 2016 the following dealers were honored with 2016 Dealer of the Year Awards[21]:

EMEA – Audiotek SARL
Spain – Arbona piza
France – Futur In Media
Portugal – Deritec
GCC – Mega Tech
Italy – Tesis
London – Aonyx
Sweden – Hages Radio TV
Switzerland – Olvision Sagl
Ireland – Cloney Audio
Benelux – B&G Audio Video Solutions BV

Additionally, Control4 partners with national homebuilders, including Toll Brothers, to provide optional home automation packages to homebuyers.[22]
Proprietary products[edit]

Audio/Video - a line of audio and video distribution products for controlling entertainment throughout a home using a centralized source.[23]
Lighting - wireless, programmable lighting control systems, controlled by switches, dimmers, keypads and remote devices.[24]
HVAC - smart thermostats, compatible with most HVAC systems worldwide and remotely controllable.[25]
Touch screens - touch screens, handheld and stationary, that operate as dedicated interfaces for Control4 systems.[26]
Remote controls - Remote controls that enable control of an entire smart home system.[27]
Controllers - main device connecting and controlling the entire system.[28]
Sensors/Relays - motion and light sensors to automatically initiate actions within the system, like turning on the lights when you enter a room.[29]
Cameras - security cameras for video intercoms, or “door stations.”[30]
Networking - following the acquisition of Pakedge in March '16

Control4 develops smart home automation systems to control lighting, entertainment, security, energy, and other connected devices.[1] The company's 2013 initial public offering was considered to be the 'first pure-play home automation IPO ever.'[2] Control4 is based in Draper, Utah with offices in York, England; Shanghai, China; Bangalore, India and San Jose, CA.[3]

History[edit]
Founded in 2003 by Eric Smith, Will West and Mark Morgan, Control4 debuted at the CEDIA 2004 home technology trade show and released its first products later that year.[4] The company received funding from Foundation Capital, Thomas Weisel Venture Partners, Signal Peak Ventures, Frazier Technology Ventures, and Cisco Systems[5] prior to its August 2, 2013 IPO.[2][5] Current CEO Martin Plaehn joined Control4 in September 2011.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Control4’s home automation systems have been likened to an operating system for the home.[7][8] The company develops a branded line of products and services to control home lighting, multi-room audio, and HVAC systems that utilize communication protocols such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Z-Wave.[9] Control4 also supports more than 8,000 devices[10] from third-party manufacturers, including the Nest smart home thermostat, [11] CoolMasterNet for seamless integration with VRF & Split HVACs,[12] Sonos music system,[13] and products from Sony[14] and Sub-Zero.[15] For example, with Control4, a homeowner could control “the ventilation in his garage, the music streaming to speakers in multiple rooms of his home, every light, the TV, the thermostat, even the Blu-Ray player in the guest house” from an iOS device.[16]
In 2012, Control4 released its Simple Device Discovery Protocol (SDDP), which makes products embedded with the code automatically discoverable on a Control4 network.[9] The company licenses the protocol, which is similar to Universal Plug and Play,[17] to other vendors for their products (such as Sony Bravia TVs).[14]
As of January 2015, over 100 developers supported SDDP in more than 500 devices, including Panasonic, Dish Network, Bose, TiVo, Epson, Harman Kardon, Denon, Pioneer, Sony, Sharp, and Yamaha.[9][18]
As of February 2015, Control4 was selling its products through a network of 2,676 North American and 787 international authorized dealers in 88 countries.[19][20] In 2016 the following dealers were honored with 2016 Dealer of the Year Awards[21]:

EMEA – Audiotek SARL
Spain – Arbona piza
France – Futur In Media
Portugal – Deritec
GCC – Mega Tech
Italy – Tesis
London – Aonyx
Sweden – Hages Radio TV
Switzerland – Olvision Sagl
Ireland – Cloney Audio
Benelux – B&G Audio Video Solutions BV

Additionally, Control4 partners with national homebuilders, including Toll Brothers, to provide optional home automation packages to homebuyers.[22]
Proprietary products[edit]

Audio/Video - a line of audio and video distribution products for controlling entertainment throughout a home using a centralized source.[23]
Lighting - wireless, programmable lighting control systems, controlled by switches, dimmers, keypads and remote devices.[24]
HVAC - smart thermostats, compatible with most HVAC systems worldwide and remotely controllable.[25]
Touch screens - touch screens, handheld and stationary, that operate as dedicated interfaces for Control4 systems.[26]
Remote controls - Remote controls that enable control of an entire smart home system.[27]
Controllers - main device connecting and controlling the entire system.[28]
Sensors/Relays - motion and light sensors to automatically initiate actions within the system, like turning on the lights when you enter a room.[29]
Cameras - security cameras for video intercoms, or “door stations.”[30]
Networking - following the acquisition of Pakedge in March '16
