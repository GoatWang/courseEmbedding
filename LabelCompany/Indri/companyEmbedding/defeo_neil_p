WILTON, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Sun Products Corporation, a leading North American fabric and 
      household care products company, with well known brands such as all®, 
      Wisk® and Snuggle®, today announced that Neil P. DeFeo, currently Chief 
      Executive Officer, will retire effective May 20, 2011, consistent with 
      his long-term goal of stepping back from day-to-day operations upon 
      turning 65. The Company further announced that Mr. DeFeo has been 
      elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sun Products, effective 
      upon his retirement as CEO.
    


      The Sun Products Corporation also announced the appointment of Jeffrey 
      Ansell as President and CEO to replace Mr. DeFeo upon his retirement. 
      Mr. DeFeo led the search that resulted in the selection of Mr. Ansell. 
      Mr. Ansell most recently served as Chief Executive Officer and member of 
      the Board of Directors of Pinnacle Foods Group, a $2 billion Company of 
      iconic packaged foods brands. Prior to this, Mr. Ansell was a Corporate 
      Officer at Procter and Gamble, where he worked for 25 years, with the 
      last 7 years as President of the Iams Pet Care subsidiary. Under his 
      leadership, P&G Pet Care sales increased nearly $1.0 billion and the 
      Iams brand in North America grew from the #5 pet food brand to #1.
    

      Mr. Ansell was honored by Fast Company magazine in 2005 as one of “The 
      Fast Fifty,” which recognizes peak performance achieved through 
      innovation. In 1997, he was named a “Top 100 Marketer of the Year” by 
      Advertising Age Magazine. Mr. Ansell also served on the Board of 
      Directors of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) in 2008 and 
      2009. He is a graduate of the Indiana University Kelley School of 
      Business, where in 2010 he was appointed to the Dean’s Council Advisory 
      Board of that school.
    

      “I am honored and delighted to have the opportunity to work with the 
      people at Sun Products Corporation and Vestar Capital Partners,” said 
      Mr. Ansell, incoming CEO. “Neil DeFeo and his team have done an 
      outstanding job creating this new company from the former Huish 
      Corporation and the North American Fabric Care division of Unilever. 
      Fueled by a strong product portfolio of iconic national brands such as 
      all®, Wisk® and Snuggle®, as well as leading retailer brands, I look 
      forward to working closely with the people of Sun Products and our 
      retail partners to build on the current progress of the Company and take 
      the business to the next level,” commented Mr. Ansell.
    

      “Jeff Ansell is an outstanding choice to succeed me as President and CEO 
      of Sun Products,” Mr. DeFeo said. “He has all the requisite skills and 
      leadership to continue our Company’s development into a major player in 
      the fabric and household care industry. I look forward to the move to 
      Chairman of Sun Products, and to supporting Jeff’s success in any way I 
      can.”
    

      Dan O’Connell, current Chairman of Sun Products and CEO of majority 
      shareholder Vestar Capital said, “Neil partnered with us in the 
      formation of Sun Products and he has done a tremendous job in 
      establishing Sun Products as a successful and important player in the 
      fabric and household care market. We will continue to benefit from 
      Neil’s experience as Chairman of the Board and as an advisor to Jeff and 
      the Company.” Mr. O’Connell continued, “Jeff is a proven CEO, effective 
      leader and innovative marketer who brings significant relevant 
      experience to our Company. We are delighted to have Jeff join Sun 
      Products as President and CEO, and as a member of the Board.”
