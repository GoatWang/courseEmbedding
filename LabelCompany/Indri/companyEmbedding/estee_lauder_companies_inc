Estee-LauderKnown for a vast array of skin care products, makeup and fragrances, Estee Lauder is one of the most reliable brands when it comes to consistent quality. Radiate natural beauty when you choose from a wide selection of anti-aging creams, facial cleansers, moisturizers and night creams that will ramp up your skin care regimen.Most Estee Lauder products take a multi-pronged approach to skin care by brightening dark spots and fortifying skin overall for a luminous look that lasts all day long. For an even smoother look, try a refinishing formula to help give your face a practically poreless appearance.Makeup removers that cleanse deeply while removing dirt and oil are a great first step for your nighttime skin care regimen. Follow with a gentle foaming cleanser that reinvigorates and softens your face. You can also choose refreshing toner to round out your routine. Repairing night creams are an equally perfect choice for restoring and maintaining your skin’s innate exfoliating abilities.Vibrant makeup—including eye shadow palettes and eyeliners in varying colors—is another one of Estee Lauder’s specialties. From stay-in-place foundations to long-lasting lipsticks, the variety of cosmetics will give you endless options for style. Punctuate your coloring with a subtle touch of blush on both cheeks that will make you truly shine!When you want to enhance your eye color and shape, outline and shade with a dramatic eyeliner and darker hued eye shadows. Make your eyebrows pop with a brow pencil that features a brow color on once side and a blending brush on the other. Don’t forget to top off your beauty regimen with a splash of intoxicating perfume scents featuring notes like jasmine, honeysuckle and vanilla. It’s the finishing touch that lends grace and elegance instantly.For the complete range of Estee Lauder products, stop in at Macy’s today to find just what you’re looking for!

Skin-CareTaking care of your skin is one of the most important parts of any beauty regimen. Starting your morning with the right facial cleanser and moisturizer can make all the difference. For those who want to pamper their skin, opt for overnight creams or weekly face masks designed to exfoliate and remove any dead skin cells. No matter what skin care regimen you decide on, you’ll find a variety of serums, creams, face washes and hydrating moisturizers.No facial cleanser is complete without the addition of a refreshing toner that clears away the excess oil naturally produced by your face. Follow with a lotion that will leave your face primed for makeup and eye shadow application.A consistent nighttime routine for your skin is also an essential part of keeping it healthy in the long run. A strong makeup remover is the first step in ensuring your face is free of dirt and oil before you go to bed. After removing your makeup, try a rejuvenating night cream that will firm and sculpt your face while working to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Having trouble with dark circles? Try a dark circle corrector that will lighten and diminish dark circles over time. Get a more luminous skin tone with the skin-fortifying properties of a corrector that works to make your under eye areas less transparent. Don’t just focus on your face when it comes to skin care. There are also a wide variety of strengthening creams and concentrates for your neck and body that will help reduce the formation of wrinkles and stretch marks. Glycerin-based formulas are ideal as well when it comes to smoothing and illuminating your skin’s natural glow.Hydrate your eyes with a relaxing eye cream that will brighten and de-puff. Instead of a warm washcloth, try using a sonic cleanser that minimizes pores and enables skin to become much more open to absorbing serums and moisturizers.Regardless of what your skin care needs are, Macy’s has everything you could want to improve and sustain your skin’s beauty!

MakeupFrom natural to dramatic-looking, the magic of makeup is undeniable. Whether you want foundations that blend perfectly with your skin tone or intense eyeliners that will accent the shape of your eyes, you’ll find it all in one convenient location. Regardless of being at the office or out on the town, get the look you want when you choose from a vast array of beauty products.Foundation is a name that says it all: It is the base of any makeup applying process, setting the tone for your facial color palette. Once you’ve applied your concealer, opt for eye shadows with a seasonal twist, such as rich, warm browns and dark greens during the fall and bright pastel pinks and purples during the spring. Layer different shades of eye shadow from the palette of your choice for a vibrant, fashion-forward aesthetic.Moisturizing lip balms and lipsticks bring out the perfect pout, while a touch of blush gives the subtle flourish you need to accent all the colors you’ve selected to highlight and complement your face. Make the look really flourish when you utilize an assortment of different brushes for your cheeks, eyes and lips.Alternate products from your favorite brands to mix and match different styles that will create bold and stunning new looks. Try a demure, natural-looking powder and nude lipstick for daytime wear, then transition into night with a touch of eye-catching blush and dramatic eyeliner.Store all of your eye pencils, brushes, lip glosses and eye palettes in a fashionable cosmetics bag so you can effortlessly touch up your face in a pinch! Miniature eye shadow compacts with an accompanying mirror are also ideal for a woman traveling or on the go. Mini lip gloss sets are equally as convenient for stowing away into your makeup bag when you want to save on space.Tie all of your hues together when you punctuate them with matching nail polish. With colors ranging from magenta to periwinkle, adding this final detail to your beauty regimen will truly put a cap on your entire appearance.Shop for all your favorite makeup brands when you browse the amazing selection at Macy’s!

Best Stocks in Beauty Products: Estee Lauder Companies Inc. and Coty Inc.
Will these two stocks beautify your portfolio?











                Leo Sun
            

                (TMFSunLion)



            
            Sep 29, 2015 at 8:45AM
            
            





Beauty product companies generally aren't known for explosive growth. Yet the industry is a fairly stable and non-cyclical one, which has grown at a pace of 3% to 5% annually over the past four years, according to cosmetics giant L'Oreal. Let's take a look at two of the best stocks in this sector -- Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) and Coty (NYSE:COTY).
Estee LauderEstee Lauder's portfolio includes well-known brands like Aveda, Donna Karan, MAC, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, La Mer, and various licensed products for fashion houses.

Source: Estee Lauder.
In fiscal 2015, Estee Lauder's revenue declined 2% annually to $10.8 billion, net earnings fell 9% to $1.09 billion, and diluted earnings per share dropped 8% to $2.82. That doesn't sound great, but those declines were mainly caused by foreign currency fluctuations, since 58% of Estee Lauder's revenue came from outside the Americas. Excluding currency impacts, sales actually rose 3%, and diluted earnings remained flat. Stripping out the impact of accelerated orders and one-time charges, sales and diluted earnings would have respectively risen 6% and 12% over the year -- not bad for a mature personal products company. The company also pays a forward annual dividend yield of 1.2%.
Estee Lauder's business is split into four main categories: makeup, fragrances, hair care products, and skin care products. In 2015, sales from the first three categories rose annually on a constant currency basis, but skin care sales slipped 2%. Skin care weakness has been an ongoing issue over the past few quarters, especially with its smaller and mid-sized brands overtaking sales of its flagship Estee Lauder and Clinique brands, which have broader distribution channels. Slower department stores sales in the U.S. and China, which recently lowered its import taxes on skin care products, also weighed down sales.





Despite its skin care struggles, Estee Lauder remains a "best in breed" stock in the beauty products industry, and its growth should return once the dollar cools off. The stock has risen about 7% over the past 12 months, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 3% decline. However, the stock isn't cheap at 28 times earnings, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 23 for the personal products sector, so investors should probably keep this one on their watchlists for now.
CotyInvestors looking for a more aggressive investment than Estee Lauder should check out Coty, which has rallied nearly 60% over the past 12 months. Coty produces fragrances, color cosmetics, and skin care products, which are sold under licensed brands. Its top brands include Calvin Klein, Chloe, Davidoff, Marc Jacobs, Adidas, and Playboy.

Source: Coty.
In fiscal 2015, Coty's revenues declined 3% annually to $4.4 billion, but remained flat on a like-for-like basis (which only includes activities which were in effect during both periods). Excluding currency impacts, revenue -- 60% of which came from outside the Americas -- rose 2%. Coty's adjusted net income rose 14% to $360 million.





During the year, sales of Coty's color cosmetics, which accounted for a third of its top line, rose 12% annually on a constant currency basis. Sales of fragrances and skin/body care products, which accounted for the rest, both declined by single digits. 
Coty plans to fill in those gaps by buying Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) perfume, hair care, and cosmetic businesses in a massive $12.5 billion merger. After that deal closes next year, Coty will overtake L'Oreal as the biggest perfume maker in the world, and become the third largest makeup company behind L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. It would gain the perfume licenses of Gucci, Hugo Boss, and Dolce & Gabbana, along with the Cover Girl and Max Factor make-up brands. The new company would more than double its size and generate annual revenues exceeding $10 billion. The merger would result in $550 million in savings, but Coty must assume P&G Beauty's $2.9 billion in debt. 
Even as it evolves into a much larger company, Coty hasn't forgotten about boosting shareholder value. It announced a new $700 million buyback plan in August, and boosted its dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share in September, which gives it a forward annual yield of 0.9%. Although Coty seems to be evolving into the next L'Oreal or Estee Lauder, it's much pricier than either company, with a trailing P/E of 42. Therefore, investors should keep a close eye on Coty, but be aware that its valuation could limit its upside potential.
The key takeawayEstee Lauder and Coty are two solid ways to invest in beauty products. Both companies have non-cyclical portfolios which hold up well during downturns, as well as strong premium brands to ward off cheaper competitors.





However, investors should be aware of the near-term risks. A strong dollar is bad for both companies, and problems across Europe and Asia could curb spending on premium beauty products. More importantly, neither stock looks cheap compared to the market or other personal care stocks, so we could see lower prices ahead.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

On October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]
Operations and finances[edit]
Finances[edit]
For fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion last year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[19]
Board of Directors[edit]
Current members of the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are: Charlene Barshefsky, Rose Marie Bravo, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Fabrizio Freda, Paul J. Fribourg, Wei Sun Christianson, Mellody Hobson, Irvine Hockaday, Jane Lauder, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S. Lauder, William P. Lauder, Richard Parsons, Barry Sternlicht and Richard F. Zannino. [20]
Executive management[edit]
Leonard A. Lauder is Chairman Emeritus. William P. Lauder is Executive Chairman. Fabrizio Freda is President and Chief Executive Officer.[21]
Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

On October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]
Operations and finances[edit]
Finances[edit]
For fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion last year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[19]
Board of Directors[edit]
Current members of the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are: Charlene Barshefsky, Rose Marie Bravo, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Fabrizio Freda, Paul J. Fribourg, Wei Sun Christianson, Mellody Hobson, Irvine Hockaday, Jane Lauder, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S. Lauder, William P. Lauder, Richard Parsons, Barry Sternlicht and Richard F. Zannino. [20]
Executive management[edit]
Leonard A. Lauder is Chairman Emeritus. William P. Lauder is Executive Chairman. Fabrizio Freda is President and Chief Executive Officer.[21]
Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998.

The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand.

On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

On October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]
Operations and finances[edit]
Finances[edit]
For fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion last year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[19]
Board of Directors[edit]
Current members of the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are: Charlene Barshefsky, Rose Marie Bravo, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Fabrizio Freda, Paul J. Fribourg, Wei Sun Christianson, Mellody Hobson, Irvine Hockaday, Jane Lauder, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S. Lauder, William P. Lauder, Richard Parsons, Barry Sternlicht and Richard F. Zannino. [20]
Executive management[edit]
Leonard A. Lauder is Chairman Emeritus. William P. Lauder is Executive Chairman. Fabrizio Freda is President and Chief Executive Officer.[21]
Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

On October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]

Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company is known for their natural skin care products. Notable lines include the "A Perfect World" line of products. Origins is also notable for its ongoing collaboration with Dr. Andrew Weil in his own line of products that target inflammation and sensitive skin.
After 25 years, the brand now has approximately 2,000 stores globally and plans to expand by opening around 90 stores in China.[1]
On May 14, 2015, Origins launched an interactive photo and video app on iTunes called #QuarterLifeCrisis that consumers can use to take sticker-decorated selfies with.[2][3]
Products[edit]
In November 2007, Origins launched the first organic line of skin care products to carry a 95% organic USDA certification seal.
In February 2011, Origins launched Happy Birthday"Plantscription", an anti-aging serum which claims to rival the leading anti-wrinkle prescription retinoid creams with 0% irritation.
In June 2015, Origins launched a new skincare collection targeting the effects of global pollution called "Three Part Harmony." This is in line with its global Pollution Defense campaign.[4]
The brand has also announced a new Original Skin collection later this year to target younger consumers' skin concerns with rough texture, enlarged pores, stressed skin, and loss of brightness.[4]
Operations and Finances[edit]
Origins' projections for 2015 include: continued strong top-line growth; increasing investment spending; constant currency net sales growth to be about 6%-7%; constant currency growth to be about 8%-10%; and emerging markets, excluding China, led by Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa to rise nearly 30%.[1]
At the end of the 2014 fiscal year, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa represented 38% of net sales and 51% of operating income, and Asia and the Pacific region represented 20% of net sales and 19% of operating income.[1]
Asia[edit]
China[edit]
Beginning July 1, 2015, Estée Lauder Companies is set to lower prices on many of its most popular products in China, affecting all skincare and makeup brands under the company and including Origins, Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, MAC, Bobbi Brown, and Lab Series. The price reduction varies from 11% on the best-selling La Mer facial cream to 23% on an Origins fragrance.[5]
Hong Kong[edit]
As of June 26, 2015, Origins recently opened its first greenhouse concept store in the IFC mall in Hong Kong to envelop its customers in an immersive and personalized space. The space showcases local material and artisanal work, including a locally sourced granite communal stone.[4]
Stéphane de la Faverie, the Senior Vice President Global/General Manager of Origins, Ojon, and Darphin, says that this concept retail store "represents a major milestone for Origins since its establishment 25 years ago."[4]
Philippines[edit]
Origins first launched in the Philippines in the early 2000s as the Sensory Therapy Peace of Mind product grew in popularity. A store-in-store is set to open in August 2015 at SM Makati after a 5-year absence in the country and region, except for Hong Kong.[6]
Environmental Commitment[edit]
By age 25, Origins has helped to plant over 500,000 trees.[3]
Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign[edit]

Feedback[edit]
Olivia Tong, a research analyst and director of US cosmetics, household and personal care at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, surveyed 1,000 Millennial women between the ages of 18 and 29 using 160 brands to find out preferred cosmetics and beauty brands. When asked what other important factors were not mentioned in their purchasing decisions, many said naturals and organics; Burt's Bees and Origins were the two most cited.[7]

As of June 26, 2015, Origins recently opened its first greenhouse concept store in the IFC mall in Hong Kong to envelop its customers in an immersive and personalized space. The space showcases local material and artisanal work, including a locally sourced granite communal stone.[4]
Stéphane de la Faverie, the Senior Vice President Global/General Manager of Origins, Ojon, and Darphin, says that this concept retail store "represents a major milestone for Origins since its establishment 25 years ago."[4]
Philippines[edit]
Origins first launched in the Philippines in the early 2000s as the Sensory Therapy Peace of Mind product grew in popularity. A store-in-store is set to open in August 2015 at SM Makati after a 5-year absence in the country and region, except for Hong Kong.[6]
Environmental Commitment[edit]
By age 25, Origins has helped to plant over 500,000 trees.[3]

History[edit]
The company is known for their natural skin care products. Notable lines include the "A Perfect World" line of products. Origins is also notable for its ongoing collaboration with Dr. Andrew Weil in his own line of products that target inflammation and sensitive skin.
After 25 years, the brand now has approximately 2,000 stores globally and plans to expand by opening around 90 stores in China.[1]
On May 14, 2015, Origins launched an interactive photo and video app on iTunes called #QuarterLifeCrisis that consumers can use to take sticker-decorated selfies with.[2][3]
Products[edit]
In November 2007, Origins launched the first organic line of skin care products to carry a 95% organic USDA certification seal.
In February 2011, Origins launched Happy Birthday"Plantscription", an anti-aging serum which claims to rival the leading anti-wrinkle prescription retinoid creams with 0% irritation.
In June 2015, Origins launched a new skincare collection targeting the effects of global pollution called "Three Part Harmony." This is in line with its global Pollution Defense campaign.[4]
The brand has also announced a new Original Skin collection later this year to target younger consumers' skin concerns with rough texture, enlarged pores, stressed skin, and loss of brightness.[4]
Operations and Finances[edit]
Origins' projections for 2015 include: continued strong top-line growth; increasing investment spending; constant currency net sales growth to be about 6%-7%; constant currency growth to be about 8%-10%; and emerging markets, excluding China, led by Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa to rise nearly 30%.[1]
At the end of the 2014 fiscal year, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa represented 38% of net sales and 51% of operating income, and Asia and the Pacific region represented 20% of net sales and 19% of operating income.[1]
Asia[edit]
China[edit]
Beginning July 1, 2015, Estée Lauder Companies is set to lower prices on many of its most popular products in China, affecting all skincare and makeup brands under the company and including Origins, Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, MAC, Bobbi Brown, and Lab Series. The price reduction varies from 11% on the best-selling La Mer facial cream to 23% on an Origins fragrance.[5]
Hong Kong[edit]
As of June 26, 2015, Origins recently opened its first greenhouse concept store in the IFC mall in Hong Kong to envelop its customers in an immersive and personalized space. The space showcases local material and artisanal work, including a locally sourced granite communal stone.[4]

Origins' projections for 2015 include: continued strong top-line growth; increasing investment spending; constant currency net sales growth to be about 6%-7%; constant currency growth to be about 8%-10%; and emerging markets, excluding China, led by Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa to rise nearly 30%.[1]
At the end of the 2014 fiscal year, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa represented 38% of net sales and 51% of operating income, and Asia and the Pacific region represented 20% of net sales and 19% of operating income.[1]
Asia[edit]
China[edit]
Beginning July 1, 2015, Estée Lauder Companies is set to lower prices on many of its most popular products in China, affecting all skincare and makeup brands under the company and including Origins, Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, MAC, Bobbi Brown, and Lab Series. The price reduction varies from 11% on the best-selling La Mer facial cream to 23% on an Origins fragrance.[5]
Hong Kong[edit]
As of June 26, 2015, Origins recently opened its first greenhouse concept store in the IFC mall in Hong Kong to envelop its customers in an immersive and personalized space. The space showcases local material and artisanal work, including a locally sourced granite communal stone.[4]
Stéphane de la Faverie, the Senior Vice President Global/General Manager of Origins, Ojon, and Darphin, says that this concept retail store "represents a major milestone for Origins since its establishment 25 years ago."[4]
Philippines[edit]
Origins first launched in the Philippines in the early 2000s as the Sensory Therapy Peace of Mind product grew in popularity. A store-in-store is set to open in August 2015 at SM Makati after a 5-year absence in the country and region, except for Hong Kong.[6]
Environmental Commitment[edit]
By age 25, Origins has helped to plant over 500,000 trees.[3]

Feedback[edit]
Olivia Tong, a research analyst and director of US cosmetics, household and personal care at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, surveyed 1,000 Millennial women between the ages of 18 and 29 using 160 brands to find out preferred cosmetics and beauty brands. When asked what other important factors were not mentioned in their purchasing decisions, many said naturals and organics; Burt's Bees and Origins were the two most cited.[7]

What People Are Saying About FragranceX.com








I checked two online websites to compare value and found FragranceX was the best. I have used this website previously so felt very comfortable when placing my order.








Terri V
Milford, MI, USA





I just love Fragrancex and have been purchasing from this online store for a number of years now. I have recommended the site to many people and they too are always extremely happy with their purchase. I even buy my son's aftershaves through Fragrancex!! I always get free delivery and as a loyal customer I also get an extra 10% discount of my purchases...... Yay!!!!








Susan K
Caulfield, Australia














I order always on fragrance X because they are the best. The products are cheap but with an excellent quality. I wait only 6 days to have my products into my hands ,however i live in Europe. That's great. I recommend this website! Thanks to fragrance x. 








Florence G
Vedène, France











I was very happy with my order placed with FragranceX.com and would recommend to any friend. I was kept updated on the progress of my items and they arrived well within time. I don't think I could have got much cheaper anywhere else and know and trust this site. Thank you!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
