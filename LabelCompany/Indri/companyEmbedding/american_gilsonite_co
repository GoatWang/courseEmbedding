Home » About » What Is Gilsonite?





A SAFE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE, COST-EFFECTIVE ADDITIVE.
Gilsonite® is our trademarked brand name for uintaite, a naturally occurring hydrocarbon resin with properties that enhance the performance of critical applications across multiple industries, including oil and gas, ink, paint, construction, asphalt and foundry.
Naturally Better®
Natural Gilsonite is non-hazardous and non-toxic. It is a very pure resinous rock, formed of a complex combination of different kinds of hydrocarbons. This unique natural combination, rich in nitrogen and beta-carotenes and low in sulfur, is what makes Gilsonite so special. Its unique chemical and physical properties make Gilsonite a high-performance, multipurpose additive that is also a cost-effective solution.
There’s Only One Gilsonite
Gilsonite is only found in one place in the world—the Uinta Basin of Northeastern Utah, where American Gilsonite controls significant reserves. Some companies claim to offer “gilsonite” from other parts of the world, but these products are simply misidentified in order to take advantage of Gilsonite’s internationally recognized quality and proven performance. Because these other materials are not true uintaites, they have inferior performance due to their different physical and chemical properties. If it doesn’t come from American Gilsonite Company, it simply isn’t Gilsonite.
Purity and Quality
Gilsonite is found in nearly straight, vertical veins across an area approximately 100 kilometers long and 50 kilometers wide. Gilsonite was formed by a unique geologic event millions of years ago that caused a proto-petroleum deposit forming at that time to fill large surface cracks, later solidifying into the pure resinous rock mined today. Gilsonite is hand-mined in underground shafts using pneumatic jack hammers. We separate Gilsonite by temperature grade, dry and screen it, size it to customer specifications, and submit it to extensive quality control procedures before shipping to over 80 countries worldwide.
If you’d like to order Gilsonite or find out more about its superior performance, please contact us.

GILSONITE IS AN EFFECTIVE LOST CIRCULATION MATERIAL THAT ASSURES ZONAL ISOLATION AND REDUCES ENVIRONMENTAL RISK.
As the challenges presented by today’s wellbore configurations increase, a properly designed cementing process is critical to keeping the wellbore isolated, protected and environmentally sound. 
For more than 50 years, the industry has depended on Gilsonite® as a lost circulation material and a critical component for primary cementing operations in some of the world’s toughest drilling environments.
Adding Gilsonite during cementing operations enhances the characteristics that are critical to effectively cementing the casing, isolating hydrocarbon formations and preventing annular gas flow.
With its unique physical and chemical properties, Gilsonite provides a range of important benefits in slurry and set cement that are unmatched by any other single additive.
Cement slurry benefits





Increases yield



Reduces slurry weight



Controls free water



Lowers slurry water ratio




Promotes favorable rheologies resulting in lower ECDs



Prevents lost circulation



Scours wellbore/enhances mud removal




Set cement benefits





Maintains compressive strength, unlike coal or fly ash



Increases flexibility



Reduces cracking



Heals microfissures



Reduces permeability



Strengthens bond to the formation and the casing



Reduces environmental risk



Assures zonal isolation




Gilsonite eliminates the problems of free waterBy controlling free water, Gilsonite helps stabilize slurry and eliminates the need for – and cost of – additional free-water-control agents. As a lost circulation material, it also improves zonal isolation by preventing water channeling on the upper side of the wellbore.

Self-healing properties help maintain zonal isolationGilsonite is flexible, deformable, swellable, impermeable and non-porous. These characteristics give Gilsonite self-healing properties that can plug induced microfissures in the cement sheath.

HISTORY OF AMERICAN GILSONITE COMPANY



+ Expand All


1860-1903

Discovery of Uintaite and Its Commercialization

The original discoverers of the natural deposits of Gilsonite® are unknown, but it is clear that the local Ute Tribe was aware of these striking geologic features before their discovery by the first pioneers of Utah. During the 1860s, samples of this unique natural bitumen were sent to leading scientists for analysis. William Phipps Blake classified it as an asphaltite and gave it its official name of “Uintaite” after its source location in the Uinta Basin.
Our trademarked name, Gilsonite, comes from the colorful character Samuel H. Gilson, the flamboyant sheriff, rancher, horse trader and supplier of horses for the pony express who was instrumental in developing this resource. Gilson’s name became linked through his persistent search for its uses and markets, and he is credited with the first real commercialization of the product. Gilson formed a partnership with Bert Seabolt in 1886 that became the Gilsonite Manufacturing Company. In 1887, the two joined with Charles O. Baxter, a mining engineer, to rename the company as the St. Louis Gilsonite Company. In 1889, Anheuser-Busch bought out Gilson’s share and changed the name to the Gilson Asphaltum Company.
In those early days, Gilsonite was mined by pickaxe and hauled by oxcart to Rifle, Colorado. The earliest uses of Gilsonite included asphalt road paving, paints and waterproofing for timbers. Anheuser-Busch used Gilsonite as a safe and effective lining for the inside of its beer barrels.





1904-1947

Development of Mines

The year 1904 marked the completion of the Uintah Railway linking the rich Black Dragon vein to Mack, Colorado by a one-of-a-kind narrow gauge rail that wound over 24 miles of mountains to reach a transfer point only 6 miles away as the crow flies. The rail line was extended to the Rainbow Vein in 1911, and together with the Dragon Vein this area was the major production center for Gilsonite from 1904 to 1935. The Rainbow Vein, one of the most productive in this period, was over 3 miles in length, 10 feet wide at the surface and mined to a depth of over 400 feet.
In 1935, the Gilson Asphaltum Company moved its principal operations to Bonanza, Utah and began mining from the Bonanza, Cowboy and other large veins near the plant. The Bonanza Vein was 30 feet wide at it widest point, and it and the other veins near the town of Bonanza are still being actively mined nearly 80 years later.  After the move to Bonanza, almost all of the products were trucked to Craig, Colorado and the Uintah Railway was abandoned. In 1938, the company changed its name to the Barber Asphalt Company, later part of Barber Oil Company.
In this period, Gilsonite continued to be used primarily as an asphalt-paving modifier and in paints; for example, Gilsonite was in the paint formula for the legendary Ford Model T. Its uses also expanded to include a diverse range of products including black telephone receivers and switchboards, printing inks, rubber substitutes, car battery casings, waterproof packaging, roofing paper, floor coverings, electric insulation and phonograph records.





1948-1990

The Chevron Era

In 1948, Barber Oil Company formed a joint venture with Standard Oil of California, now Chevron. The new company was named American Gilsonite Company.
 By 1957, the town of Bonanza had grown to more than 200 people and the company increased its research and development efforts. Seeking to increase capacity, American Gilsonite Company introduced hydraulic mining with pressure hoses and mechanical cutters using water pressure.  During this period, we achieved record mining volumes, and through intensive research, expanded our product line to include sealers and adhesives, oil drilling fluid and cementing additives, and construction materials such as fiberboards.





1991-2007

Development of Current End Markets

Chevron sold the company in 1991 and between 1991 and 2007, the Company  consolidated its efforts as a smaller, privately owned entity. During this period, we expanded our international sales and established our preeminence as a high-quality performance additive in drilling fluids and cementing, printing inks, asphaltic paints, foundry castings such as iron engine blocks and brake calipers, construction materials, and asphalt applications such as road paving and emulsions for surface treatments.





2008-2012

Substantial Investment in Mining Capacity to Meet Surging Demand

Between 2008 and 2012, demand for Gilsonite increased so rapidly that it outpaced our mine development efforts in the prior years. To address the surge in demand, we doubled the size of our workforce, greatly expanded the number of mines under development and increased our capital spending by a factor of ten. We invested in research for new mining and innovations in shaft-sinking. Recognizing the need to be closer to our largest end market, we added a new office in Houston, Texas, and also expanded our sales team with drilling fluid and other technical experts. These combined actions allowed us to significantly expand the production and sales of Gilsonite throughout the world.





2013 and Beyond

Continuing to Expand Production Capacity  While Partnering
				    with Our Customers to Solve Their Technical Challenges

To ensure our ability to reliably meet demand cycles looking forward, we launched a strategic plan to greatly increase our mining capacity by developing more mines and by training new miners. We will continue expanding our sales force to ensure customer service and add to our knowledge about our end markets. We have also increased our technical services and research and development efforts so that we can continue to partner with our customers. American Gilsonite is here for the long term, and we are continually dedicated to improving all aspects of our business.

Gilsonite Suppliers





American Gilsonite Company (AGC)
We are the UK and Irish agent and distributor for a range of  high quality products produced by the American Gilsonite Company (AGC).  The American Gilsonite Company is based in Bonanza, Utah, in America, and has been mining Gilsonite since 1888.  Gilsonite is the registered trademark of the American Gilsonite Company.  It is a non-hazardous, naturally occurring, hydrocarbon resin that is similar in appearance to coal or hard asphalt.  It may also be referred to as an asphaltum, uintaite or uintahite.
We market these products to three important application sectors – printing inks, paints, and in the foundry sector.  In each sector particular grades may be used, however some overlap of grades may occur.  The different grades are screened for impurities, then dried to a controlled moisture content, and classified according to particle size.  The material may be shipped directly from the mine to the customer, or alternatively from our warehouses.  Material can be supplied in 25 kg bags and 1000 kg big bags.
Chemical Products Sector
This sector includes the binder and coating, metallurgical, wood products, and refractory industries.  It is also sold as a bitumen modifier, and is used as part of the drilling mud formulation in oil well industries.  These application areas are very diverse and a number of special grades are available.

12. ADDITIONAL HEALTH 
DATA


_________________________________________________________________________
ADDITIONAL HEALTH DATA 
COMMENT:
No significant health 
effects were observed in a chronic feeding study conducted for the National 
Toxicology Program (NTP) where mice and rats were fed diets containing either 2% 
or 4% GILSONITE for their lifetimes. In another study, 10% GILSONITE in benzene 
applied 3 times a week for 80 weeks to the skin of mice caused no increase in 
skin cancer over what was observed in the control group. In a third study, a 
sample of GILSONITE heated to 550�F (288�C) and cooled was not found to be 
mutagenic in the Ames assay. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health was unable to detect polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in GILSONITE. The 
information presented above suggests that GILSONITE has a low order of toxicity 
and is not carcinogenic.
Although ER Resin is not a 
carcinogen, processes in which GILSONITE is brought to very high temperatures 
may alter its complex hydrocarbon structure and may produce carcinogenic 
substances. Thermal cracking of complex hydrocarbon is known to produce 
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are known to be carcinogenic 
and mutagenic. Ames mutagenicity screening tests were conducted on samples of 
GILSONITE which were heated. A sample heated to 650�F (343�C) and allowed to 
cool was found to be mutagenic. In another study, GILSONITE distilled at 
approximately 2500�F (1371�C) and dissolved in benzene was carcinogenic when 
applied 3 times a week for 80 weeks to the skin of mice.
Handling ER Resin is not 
expected to cause cancer. However, skin contact and breathing of vapor or mists 
derived from certain processes in which ER Resin is heated to high temperatures 
should be avoided. Please refer to the Special Precautions section of this 
document.
