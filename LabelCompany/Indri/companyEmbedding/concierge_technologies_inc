The product offering includes the dual-lens, high-definition, video camera with 30 fps video capture on the integrated DVR with GPS tracking, audio recording and event diagnostic sensors that are to be installed in Los Angeles taxi cabs.    Peter Park, president of 3rd Eye Cam, commented, "This sale in Los Angeles is a validation of ourtechnology as the preferred device for taxi cab use. Regulatory agencies across the country, including Los Angeles, have embraced our camera as meeting or exceeding their stringent requirements and consider its presence in the vehicle as a significant deterrent to crime and a valuable tool in heightening driver security and as an administrative risk management application for owners and insurers." Gross revenues for Concierge have continued to climb from approximately $36,000 for the fiscal year endingJune 30, 2010 when the business was started to an aggregate of now over $2 million. David Neibert, CEO of Concierge, stated, "We are extremely pleased with the progress made by 3rd Eye Cam during the current fiscal year. With the expanding market awareness, and the increasing regulatory mandates for security recording technologies in vehicles for hire, our product sales have increased as projected, allowing us to focus on other matters concerning growth of the company such as new product development, horizontal markets and creation of synergistic partnerships within the industry. We are projecting 2012 to be a time of continued growth for Concierge Technologies."       \       Concierge Technologies No Longer Development Stage          Leading Edge Mobile Incident Reporting VIDEO LINK http://www.3rdeyecam.com/ Planet Halo Brand  http://www.planethalo.com/        OTCBB Company Profile   CNCG - CONCIERGE TECH INC         Concierge Technologies Inc 3615 Superior Avenue Suite 3102D Cleveland, OH 44114 United States Phone: +1 866 800-2978 Parent Company http://conciergetech.net/ David W.
