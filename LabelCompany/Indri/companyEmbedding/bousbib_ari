Business model[edit]
IMS Health is best known for its collection of healthcare information spanning sales, de-identified prescription data, medical claims, electronic medical records[9] and social media.[10] IMS Health’s products and services are used by companies to develop commercialization plans[11] and portfolio strategies,[12] to select patient and physician populations for specific therapies, and to measure the effectiveness of pharmaceutical marketing and sales resources.[13] The firm uses its own data to produce syndicated reports such as market forecasts and market intelligence.
History and acquisitions[edit]
The original name of the company was Intercontinental Marketing Statistics, hence the IMS name. IMS Health's corporate headquarters is located in Danbury, Connecticut, United States. The company's chairman and CEO is Ari Bousbib.

In 2002, IMS Health acquired Cambridge Pharma Consultancy, a privately held international firm that provides strategic advice to pharmaceutical management.
In 2003, acquired Marketing Initiatives, a specialist in healthcare facility profile data, and Data Niche Associates, a provider of rebate validation services for Medicaid and managed care.

In 2005, acquired PharMetrics, a U.S. provider of patient-centric integrated claims data.
In 2006, acquired the Life Sciences practice of Strategic Decisions Group, a portfolio strategy consultant to the life sciences industry.
In 2007, IMS Health acquired IHS and MedInitiatives, providers of healthcare data management analytics and technology services. That same year, ValueMedics Research was acquired, extending IMS Health’s health economics and outcomes research capabilities.
In 2007, ranked in the Businessweek 50. This list represents "best in class" companies from the ten economic sectors that make up the S&P 500.[14]

In 2010, acquired Brogan, Inc., a privately held market research and consulting firm serving the Canada healthcare market.

In 2012, acquired DecisionView, a software solutions company that helps life sciences organizations plan and track patient enrollment for clinical trials[16] and TTC,[17] a benchmarking solutions and analytics company that helps clients plan for and negotiate the costs of clinical trials.

In May 2016, the company announced it would merge with Quintiles in an approximate $9 billion deal,[22] in the process creating a new entity called Quintiles IMS. Combined 2015 revenue for the two companies would exceed $7.2 billion and the combined entity is estimated to have a market capitalisation in excess of $17.6 billion.[23] IMS Health shareholders will receive 0.384 shares of Quintiles common stock for each share of IMS Health common stock they hold, leaving the split of ownership at 51.4% IMS and 48.6% Quintiles.[24][25] The merger will create one of the largest providers of healthcare data, technology, and services solutions in the world, and is scheduled to close by the second half of 2016.[26]

Ari Bousbib, President, UTC Commercial Companies to Depart UTC

			
				August 16, 2010
			
			
		







Main ContentHARTFORD, Conn. - United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today announced Ari Bousbib, UTC Executive Vice President and president of its commercial companies, will leave the corporation effective Sept. 1 to accept a position as Chief Executive Officer for IMS Health.
Louis Chênevert, UTC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: “Ari is an exceptional leader and has had a remarkable 14-year career at UTC. Most recently, he led the transformation of UTC’s commercial business portfolio to reduce complexity, lower costs and increase margins.
“Throughout his career, Ari has demonstrated outstanding strategic vision and operational expertise as well as superb teamwork and the highest integrity. I greatly appreciate Ari’s support during UTC’s successful leadership transition over the last five years, and wish him well in his new responsibilities,” Chênevert added.
Bousbib joined UTC in 1997 as vice president, strategic planning. He oversaw important changes to the corporation’s business portfolio, including the acquisition of Sundstrand and the divestiture of UTC’s automotive business. He was named chief operating officer at Otis in 2000, became Otis president in 2002, and was named UTC executive vice president and president, commercial companies, in 2008.
“UTC has been a big part of my life for 14 years,” Bousbib said. “It is a great company of strong businesses and terrific, talented people. While I will miss them, I know the hard work of the last few years has placed Otis, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security on a solid path to continued strong, best-in-class performance in the years ahead.”
To facilitate a smooth transition of responsibilities, Bousbib has agreed to remain available to consult with the corporation through September 2011.
United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., is a diversified company providing high technology products and services to the global aerospace and building industries.
