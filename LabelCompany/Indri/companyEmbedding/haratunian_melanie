Melanie Haratunian 

















Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary 




Melanie Haratunian is Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary for Akamai. Ms. Haratunian oversees all legal and regulatory matters for Akamai's operations worldwide. Her responsibilities include directing the company's transactional, intellectual property, litigation and compliance matters. She brings to Akamai more than 25 years of experience in technology advocacy, corporate leadership, negotiations, business development and strategic planning. 


Before joining Akamai in 2003, Ms. Haratunian served as Vice President and Deputy General Counsel at Allegiance Telecom Company Worldwide. There she managed the legal practice for all lines of business and supervised all transactional and litigation professionals on behalf of the 4,000-employee company. She also worked as General Counsel for Allegiance Internet, Inc., overseeing all legal matters for the company's eight Internet access and web-hosting subsidiaries. Prior to Allegiance Telecom, Ms. Haratunian was Vice President and General Counsel of HarvardNet, Inc., where she established and managed the company's legal department through its entire life cycle. 


As a Partner at the law firm of Halprin, Temple, Goodman & Sugrue in Washington D.C. and as a senior official at the Federal Communications Commission, Ms. Haratunian was recognized as a national expert on customer privacy issues. In that capacity, she provided legal and regulatory counsel on matters impacting privacy legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress, and those affecting her firm's Fortune 100 corporate clients. She also developed the customer privacy regulations that were incorporated into the 1996 Telecommunications Act, a statute that now applies to all U.S. telecommunications carriers. 


Ms. Haratunian holds a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in Political Science from Boston College.
