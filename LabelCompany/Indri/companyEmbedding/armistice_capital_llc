Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Spectrum Pharmaceuticals: Our Thoughts On Armistice Capital's 13D - Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Spectrum Pharmaceuticals: Our Thoughts On Armistice Capital's 13DMay.18.15 | About: Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, (SPPI) The Visible Hand Long/short equity, value, contrarian




SummaryWe continue to find meaningful downside to SPPI from its current stock price. SPPI’s assets do not fit our view of the criteria of recent M&A deals in the industry.The PTCL franchise has been underperforming despite significant investments. Zevalin and Marqibo have minimal real OR option value due to declining and low sales level and short duration of IP.High royalties and future milestone payments to Ligand require overly optimistic assumptions to justify the valuation of Evomel claimed by Armistice.The proper comparison point from the MRK/INSM deal to SPI-2012 is zero since MRK discontinued the products after 2011. If approved, SPI-2012, in our opinion, will face commercial challenges.Armistice may have limited ability to pressure SPPI over the next 12-15 months.The author of this article is an SEC-registered investment adviser. At the time of publication, funds and accounts managed by the author were short Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI).

The author makes no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth in this article and undertakes no duty to update its contents.

We find it amazing how much credit the market is willing to give to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s ("SPPI") management and pipeline despite what we believe are the repeated failure of both to perform.
Last week, Armistice Capital, LLC ("Armistice") filed a 13D on SPPI. Armistice points out management's failures while suggesting that this same management team has somehow assembled a pipeline of valuable drugs that the company could immediately monetize at a significant premium. We believe that Armistice makes many lofty claims in its letter but fails to provide what we regard as any meaningful support for them. A closer look at these claims and SPPI's pipeline reveals what we believe to be more of the same: many projections from management that have yet to materialize.
We believe that thoughtful, knowledgeable buyers of pharma assets should not find any value at SPPI in excess of its current price. In fact, we believe the risk is much higher that SPPI's business and pipeline are worth far less than its current share price justifies. With SPPI continuing to burn cash, the potential for additional financing dilution remains, in our view, a possibility. Moreover, SPPI's common shareholders are already facing an incremental 24 million share dilution, or 36% of common shares outstanding, from options and convertible bonds that are ready to dilute the common shareholders at the first sign of any upside. Thus with 100% of the downside but meaningfully diluted upside, the risk/reward calculus appears to us to be unfavorable for common shareholders. Please see our updated valuation discussion at the end of this article. We continue to find meaningful downside to SPPI from its current stock price. We believe that SPPI's marketed drugs are generously worth no more than $200mm, which implies a $400mm pipeline value assuming a 40% premium to SPPI's stock price the day prior to Armistice 13D filing.
We present an analysis of many of Armistice's points from the 13D. Selling the company at some sort of significant premium presupposes that a single buyer would want all of these assets and ignores the very real problems that we believe each has. We believe a sale is unlikely for the reasons highlighted below.


"Joe Turgeon and Tom Riga did a miraculous job stabilizing and then growing Fusilev."
We disagree with Armistice that Joe Turgeon and Tom Riga have done a miraculous job on Fusilev. Since Joe Turgeon joined SPPI in October 2012, he has been a senior decision maker as SVP of Commercial Operations and more recently as President and COO. We believe Turgeon and Riga bear at least some responsibility for the Fusilev patent problems insofar as, on their watch, the Fusilev patent was successfully challenged. At a minimum, it does not seem to us that Turgeon and Riga have done a miraculous job stabilizing and growing Fusilev. In our opinion, which we shared last year in this matter, the patent case wasn't even close. SPPI now finds itself with a generic entrant to Fusilev that already negatively impacted sales in Q1 (down $10M from Q4) before the generic even entered the market. Fusilev is SPPI's primary source of cash flow. Listening to Dr. Shrotriya, Turgeon, and Riga, you would never know how important Fusilev is to the business, because it appears to us they are trying to focus investors' attention on the pipeline and away from the troubles of the marketed products. But Fusilev's cash flow is what funds this pipeline.
Did Turgeon and Riga really stabilize Fusilev? On the Q4 2012 earnings call on February 21, 2013, SPPI management guided to stability in Fusilev as well as year-over-year growth in 2013 total revenues and operating income as compared to 2012:
"So when we look at FUSILEV business right now, what we see is end-user demand, customer generated demand is very, very stable right now…The second point I think that will help to clarify it is today, 75% of FUSILEV business is in the clinic setting. That is a setting that is very, very sticky for FUSILEV…We expect total revenues in operating income to grow in 2013 over 2012."

However, on March 12, 2013, less than three weeks after providing the above guidance on 2013, SPPI management took down guidance significantly. At that time, the company reported $268M in revenues in 2012 and revised down its 2013 guidance by more than $100M:
"Spectrum Pharmaceuticals anticipates total company revenues in the range of $160 to $180 million for the full-year 2013."
History appears to be repeating itself post Fusilev's patent loss. As recently as February 24, 2015, at the RBC Conference, management downplayed the impact from the negative patent ruling:
"So I want to remind people that orphan drug designation is even more powerful than any patent because this was enacted by Act of Congress in 1993. So - and the orphan drug designation is not for drugs. It's not for molecules. It is actually for indication. Orphan drug designation is given for indication. So the indication for metastatic colorectal cancer is protected under Congress Law that's called orphan drug designation. And it is - that cannot be challenged in the court of law and that is a very powerful message for us. If you look at our revenue base for Spectrum's FUSILEV, almost entirely 99.9% sales come from colorectal cancer indication. FUSILEV also has approval for what is called osteogenic sarcoma and methotrexate overdose poisoning. That patent actually expires in March. Now minding osteogenic sarcoma, it's a pediatric indication. So somebody - if the patent is invalid as the judge has ruled, so clearly, somebody is allowed to market the drug under that scenario for osteogenic sarcoma. But there's a pediatric indication you keep in mind. So it's not good because our patent was good until 2022, and now, we can sell our drug only until 2018…So, I really can't tell you what their position is, but I'll tell you one more thing that the Sandoz generic product is not similar in any way to FUSILEV. It is a liquid formulation that is not stable at room temperature. It has to be refrigerated. While our drug is a lyophilized formulation which is good for three years, you can throw it in the back of your car. Drive day after day and put three years, you can use it for patients. So, I want people to understand that a generic version that to best of my knowledge Sandoz has filed is a liquid formulation and not a FUSILEV - not the same formulation as ours."

Then, less than three months later on the Q1 2015 earnings call, management changed its tune and said the following:
"We have competition from FUSILEV and expect significantly diminished revenue this year. We have been aware of this potential decline in sales and have planned for this eventuality."
In our opinion, the writing is on the wall, but the market has yet to fully digest its implications. Consensus Fusilev estimates for 2016 and 2017 are still at $32M and $25M, respectively.
The reality is that we believe Fusilev will decline much, much more because of how Medicare Part B drug reimbursement functions. For Part B drugs, Medicare reimburses at ASP + 6%. ASP is calculated as the volume-based average of Fusilev and generic Fusilev. Notice that the reimbursements for both brand and generic Fusilev are the same. Thus, in our opinion, there is a strong economic incentive for doctors to purchase generic Fusilev and make outsized profit as illustrated below. In fact, once generic Fusilev has gained a certain market share, doctors who purchase brand Fusilev will lose money on their purchase of brand Fusilev. Given that many of the current Fusilev prescribers appear to be economically savvy since they stuck with Fusilev instead of switching back to generic leucovorin after the generic leucovorin shortage abated, we predict that many will recognize the profit / loss scenarios highlighted below and will switch to prescribing generic Fusilev. Longtime SPPI watchers will know that the company often touted the fact that its prescribing doctors made more money prescribing Fusilev instead of leucovorin and therefore were unlikely to switch completely back. It appears SPPI was right and we think this same rational behavior will now drive the uptake of generic Fusilev.


We find it difficult to agree with Armistice's statement that Messrs. Turgeon and Riga did a miraculous job on Fusilev.
"And they've done a great job growing your PTCL franchise."
It is unclear to us how Armistice drew its conclusion on this. Let's go back to the history of SPPI's PTCL franchise, which is comprised of Folotyn and Beleodaq. On the April 5, 2012 call discussing SPPI's acquisition of Allos Therapeutics, management said the following:
"FOLOTYN was approved in the United States in September 2009, launched in January 2010 and net sales of FOLOTYN were $50.5 million …We expect FOLOTYN's annual sales could reach excess of $100 million."
However, after SPPI acquired Allos, Folotyn has struggled to live up to these expectations. Not only did Folotyn not hit the $100M in sales that management referenced on the call, it also actually never got back to the $50M annual sales that Allos generated prior to being acquired by SPPI despite benefiting from multiple price increases since 2011 (AWP went from $3,750 in 2011 to $4,818 in early 2015). Given that Folotyn hasn't even gotten back to its pre SPPI peak sales generated in 2011, its second full year after launch, how can one conclude that SPPI's team has done a great job here?

Lastly, Teva, Sandoz, Fresenius, Kabi, and Dr. Reddy's are each currently challenging Folotyn's patents in court. The team may not have much more time to "grow" this asset.
Now, some bulls might say that we need to look at the overall PTCL franchise. This means we need to include the contribution from Beleodaq. While it is still early, it does not appear to us that Beleodaq is coming out of the gate strongly. The drug quickly hit a plateau in the third quarter after its launch with a sequential decline in sales. This launch trajectory does not suggest to us that Beleodaq will be a large drug.


Moreover, SPPI has spent more than $90M in milestone payments and R&D expense on Beleodaq so far. The agreement with TopoTarget further stipulates a double digit percentage royalty on sales as well as up to an additional $278M in future milestone payments. At annualized sales of 11M, or 8x sales before including potential future milestone payments, Beleodaq appears to be a very expensive investment to keep the PTCL franchise flat.
Lastly, some bulls may believe the value of Beleodaq to a potential acquirer is understated based on current revenues as they think an acquirer may be able to take a large price increase on Beleodaq similar to what we have seen in some M&A deals in the industry. As one of two approved histone deacetylase ("HDAC") inhibitors but with only the PTCL indication versus Istodax's PTCL and CTLC indications, we believe Beleodaq has little room, if any, to increase its price beyond the premium it already has over Istodax without risking exclusion from payors' formularies.

Overall, SPPI's PTCL franchise has ((i)) most of its revenues coming from a product that appears to be in decline and the patent for which is currently subject to multiple generic challenges (Folotyn), ((ii)) a recently launched drug that appears to have plateaued pretty quickly at a low level and lacks meaningful pricing opportunity (Beleodaq), and ((iii)) more potent competition such as Seattle's Adcetris, which showed 100% ORR in frontline PTCL setting when combined with CHOP. We believe the future of this franchise will resemble its past performance, which is disappointing.

"They need additional high quality assets. Zevalin and Marqibo have significant option value without the threat of generic competition."
Finally, we do agree with Armistice that Zevalin and Marqibo's value are probably only "option value" since they currently have very limited value. While Zevalin was approved as a biologic, hence it would not be subject to generic competition, it could potentially face biosimilar competition after its patents expire sometime between 2016 and 2019. However, if Zevalin continues its decline trajectory, we believe that it may not have much of any sales left to attract biosimilar competition at all.

In terms of Zevalin's option value, it appears it is unlikely to materialize. While SPPI's management previously has touted Zevalin's potential value in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, enrollment into the trial unfortunately was too slow and SPPI already discontinued the trial as announced on the Q2 2014 earnings call. We are not sure what "significant option value" remains for Zevalin at this point:
"We've made an important strategic decision regarding the ZEST trial. This trial was enrolling very slowly, required significant capital investment over time and would not have yielded results leading to an indication expansion in a timely fashion. Therefore we've discontinued the study."
Marqibo is even more interesting. After the acquisition of product, management, as it has in the past with respect to its products, initially expressed optimism. On SPPI's Q3 2013 earnings call, management said the following regarding Marqibo:
"I'm particularly excited about the recent launch of our newest drug, Marqibo, for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Philadelphia negative ALL. These are some early promising indications that Marqibo is being well received by care providers. Our commercial team is launching this product with focus and vigor. And early indications are exceeding our expectations.... Marqibo is off to a nice start."

In reality, Marqibo generated $1.3M in sales in the first full quarter since launch, quickly reached a plateau at around $1.5-$2.0M in quarterly sales and, seven quarters later, does not appear to be showing signs of life.

Moreover, we are not sure why Armistice doesn't think it will be subject to generic competition since it was approved via an NDA instead of a BLA. With all of its patents expiring in 2020, we see no reason why generics can't enter. With respect to further option value in Marqibo, it seems to us to be far-fetched. Marqibo development does not appear to be a part of SPPI's priority as indicated by management's desire to deprioritize certain R&D projects, as expressed on its Q1 2015 earnings call. After all, why spend a lot of money on R&D to develop additional indications over next few years just to launch when all of Marqibo patents, including the composition of matter patent, expire in 2020? Even if new method of use patents can be obtained for the new indications, generics can enter the same way they do now on Fusilev - by getting a carve-out label for the indication that is no longer protected. Perhaps this is one lesson management learned from the Fusilev patent experience.
"Evomela is a meaningful, low risk, near-term commercial opportunity arguably worth half your market capitalization."
We would actually like to see the analysis from Armistice to support this statement. As discussed below, we believe Evolmela is worth approximately 50 cents per share. This figure actually seem generous to us when compared to the $1.33 per share value an FBR analyst recently assigned to all of SPPI's assets outside apaziquone, poziotinib and SPI-2012.
When one assesses the value of Evomela, one needs to keep in mind a number of things. First, the differences between Evomela and standard melphalan are not clinically meaningful, in our opinion, as detailed in one of our previous articles. In fact, we could not find any case of propylene glycol-related toxicity from the use of standard melphalan in the science literature. Doctors we consulted reported never seeing any patient experience propylene glycol toxicity from melphalan. They also reported observing no problems with the short stability of standard melphalan. Even the presenter at the SPPI 2015 Analyst Day Presentation agreed:

"Adverse event safety profile in this study appears consistent with what has been reported with high-dose treatment with standard Melphalan."
Clearly, a solution to a problem that may not exist has little value.
Second, there are currently two companies selling standard melphalan (already genericized). It is unclear what angle SPPI has to displace a proven drug that has worked well for many years. Third, while the market is ~$100M in size, if SPPI decided to discount Evomela to gain share as we think it needs to, the addressable market size would be much smaller at this lower price point so one needs to be careful in having realistic market share AND pricing assumptions. Since melphalan is used in the hospital / transplant center setting where the institutions absorb the costs of melphalan as part of their overall transplant reimbursement, there would be virtually no opportunity to price Evomela at a premium to standard melphalan given the lack of meaningful differentiation. Lastly, some may forget that SPPI owes Ligand 20% royalties and up to $66M milestone payments as disclosed in SPPI's 2014 10-K. Overall, we find it difficult to see Evomela being worth half of SPPI's market cap as claimed by Armistice, unless we start using what we believe to be overly optimistic assumptions (i.e., almost 100% market share at parity pricing to standard melphalan). It is unclear to us why we should repeat the same mistakes management has made in the past. Below is our analysis on Evomela's valuation based on what we believe are reasonable assumptions given the logic explained above.

"Apaziquone appears to be a highly active treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer."
Interestingly, with the presumptive benefit of detailed data, Allergan decided to return its rights on apaziquone to SPPI in early 2013 in exchange for a single-digit royalty on future sales after spending millions of dollars developing it. What did Allergan miss that Armistice sees?

According to SPPI's Q4 2011 earnings call, each of the two pivotal phase 3 trials enrolled 800 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ("NMIBC") patients. According to SPPI's press release in April 2012, neither one of the trials hit the primary endpoint. But when data from the two trials is pooled together, the primary end point has a p-value of 0.0174. For reasons unexplained to investors, SPPI seems to have presented this same p-value as 0.022 at its 2015 Analyst Day. This moves the p-value further away from what FDA typically requires when data from two trials are pooled. SPPI's management further made the following claim at the Deutsche Bank conference in May 2011:
"But interestingly enough, if you make that trial, what I will call a more robust trial, just by combining 800 patients each to give you a total of 1,600 patients, the trial does meet statistical significance."
While a p-value of <0.05 is traditionally perceived to represent statistical significance by the scientific community, it is only in the context of a single trial. When pooling data from two trials, assuming the trials are suitable to pooling based on the trial designs, the FDA typically requires p<0.01 to be considered statistically significantHence, we believe that the statement made by SPPI management is incorrect:
"If the global null hypothesis was not rejected, then the protocol states the null hypothesis would be rejected if the p-value from the pooled analysis was less than 0.01 and at least one of the analyses from a single study had a p-value less than 0.049."
As SPPI previously disclosed, each P3 trial was 80% powered to show a 12% absolute delta between the two treatment arms. Thus, the trials were powered sufficiently to show any clinical meaningful difference between apaziquone and placebo. Nonetheless, the trials failed to hit the primary endpoints. In fact, the p-values weren't even close while the confidence intervals of the active arm and the placebo arms clearly overlap. Moreover, the 6.7% indicates that the efficacy of apaziquone is low, much lower than what Allergan and SPPI originally expected (12%), and, we believe, likely much lower than what would be clinically meaningful or considered "highly active" as Armistice claimed.


Now, as some life sciences companies like to do after a well-designed, large clinical trial fails, we believe that one possible interpretation is that SPPI decided to try to "fit the data with a new hypothesis" by performing a retrospectively defined subgroup analysis. Were that the case, by cutting the data so that one looks at only 217 out of 1,614, or merely 13%, of patients enrolled in the trials, SPPI could demonstrate some efficacy in apaziquone. But, the FDA has requested SPPI perform another P3 study. In our opinion, the new P3 trial design introduces additional risks, given changes compared to the previous P3 studies. Based on the disclosure at the Analyst Day in April, the new P3 study's primary endpoint has changed from relapse rate at two years to time to relapse. Additionally, the drug will be given twice instead of once, and the study has other minor changes that SPPI did not detail publicly. As experienced life sciences investors know, the probability of hitting primary endpoint in a trial increases if the same primary endpoint was hit in a similarly designed previous trial. The more changes in the new trial compared to a prior trial, the less confidence one would have in the probability of success. Even if apaziquone is able to hit the primary endpoint in this new P3 study and gains FDA approval, the label is, we believe, likely to be restrictive and to reflect the significantly smaller patient population in which the new P3 study is tested. At the end of the day, the likelihood of apaziquone having meaningful value is, in our view, extremely low. Perhaps that is the reason Allergan no longer wanted to continue funding the development of apaziquone; as we believe it's a bad return on investment no matter the outcome.

"Finally, your investigational candidate, SPI-2012, has significant value. Merck ("MRK") paid Insmed ("INSM") $130 million to access its Neupogen/Neulasta follow-on biologics. Recent deals by Pfizer ("PFE"), Hospira ("HSP"), Pfenex ("PFNX"), Momenta ("MNTA"), and Amgen ("AMGN") affirm the value of this market, as does the commercial performance of Teva Pharmaceuticals ("TEVA") in the U.S. and HSP and Sandoz in Europe."
In our opinion, the comparison to the Merck / Insmed deal is flawed in many aspects. First, Insmed's products do not carry any royalty or milestone obligations, while SPPI owes Hanmi a mid-teens royalty on SPI-2012 net sales and up to $238M in milestone payments. Second, part of what Merck paid for was a ~50,000 square foot biologic process development analytical laboratory and manufacturing facility, while SPPI has no manufacturing plant to speak of, and is dependent on Hanmi for the production of SPI-2012. Armistice also did not mention that Merck discontinued the development of these products after 2011. So with sunk costs of $130M, Merck still decided to kill the required incremental development costs on these products presumably because they saw low incremental return on investment.
Thus, if one wants to use these products as a benchmark for what SPI-2012 is worth, then we believe the more correct number is at most zero. Note that happens to be pretty close to what SPPI paid to Hanmi in early 2012 to secure the rights to SPI-2012. Moreover, the other deals Armistice referenced are for companies that have real technology and infrastructure for the biosimilar market. All SPPI has in SPI-2012 is a drug it in-licensed at a cost of close to zero.
Lost in all the noise is the fact that SPI-2012 is NOT a biosimilar drug, but rather an undifferentiated brand drug. So it should be evaluated as such. We are going to spend time on this topic since now that much of what could go wrong for SPPI's marketed products has already transpired, and SPI-2012 seems to be the key potential value driver the bulls have latched on to.

After extensive evaluation of SPI-2012, we have identified a number of risks that we believe are worth exploring here. First, SPI-2012 has demonstrated a me-too efficacy and safety profile only in a limited number of patients. Second, SPI-2012 uses LAPSCOVERY technology instead of the pegylation technology used in both Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and biosimilar Neulasta. Bear in mind that both Neulasta and the pegylation technologies have a long history of proven efficacy and safety. There has never been a drug using LAPSCOVERY technology approved by any regulatory agency. Third, the biologic manufacturing plant that Hanmi has in Korea, according to its website, has not been certified by the FDA or European regulators to meet good manufacturing practices. The only marketed products the plant has produced are hyaluronate products being sold in Korea. Biologic manufacturing that meets the US and EU standard is not a trivial process and is different from making hyaluronate to be sold in Korea. Thus, we believe that there is risk related to SPI-2012 manufacturing assuming its efficacy and safety profile holds up in the new P3 trial.
Lastly, the market dynamic of long-acting filgrastim is going to evolve rapidly over the next several years as biosimilars enter the market. For example, biosimilars have taken ~80% of the short-acting G-CSF market in Europe. With prior experience in biosimilar short-acting G-CSF, we expect the pace of adoption in biosimilar Neulasta to be robust. When combining these risks with what we believe is an under-appreciation of how biosimilar Part B reimbursement works, we believe there are going to be commercial challenges for SPI-2012. Let's explore some of these key issues further.
In terms of clinical profile, SPPI presented the following data in its Analyst Day in April of this year:


While the 270 ug/kg arm was shown to be superior to pegfilgrastim, the difference is actually not clinically meaningful, a fact that came out when Dr. Vacirca, the expert who presented the data on behalf of SPPI at the Analyst Day, answered the following question during Q&A:
Q: Can you comment on how important that relative superiority would be for somebody like you? And then put the 3.6 mg dose into perspective tied to the Phase 2 data.
A: I think when you look at the historic data, when the duration of severe neutropenia is less than a day for both of the doses of SPI-2012 as well as for pegfilgrastim obtaining superiority quite frankly is not important. The duration is so non-existent the risk is mitigated by both of the doses of 2012 as well as the pegfilgrastim. In terms of the dose that we came up with for the Phase 3 trial at 3.6 milligrams, it comes out to about 180 micrograms per kilo for a 75-kilogram person. So it came out just in between that 1.35 and the 2.70 dose that we used in the Phase 2 trial, but it also gave us the opportunity to have an equivalent volume to what is utilized now.
In addition, the dose to be used in Phase 3 is not even at the 270 ug/ kg dose so the "superiority" of the 270 ug/kg claim is largely irrelevant. When it comes to safety, the data presented showed SPI-2012 to be comparable to pegfilgrastim. Together with the efficacy data, SPI-2012 appears to be a me-too product that lacks the long history of proven efficacy and safety in tens of thousands of patients that Neulasta can boast. In the current reimbursement environment, we believe it would be difficult for SPI-2012 to compete with both brand and biosimilar pegfilgrastim.

According to publicly available information, Sandoz, Hospira, Apotex, Amneal, Teva and Samsung all have an approved biosimilar Neupogen / filgrastim or are developing one. In addition, eight different manufacturers (Sandoz, Hospira, Pfenex, Apotex, Amneal, Merck KGaA, Coherus and Mylan / Biocon) are developing biosimilar Neulasta / filgrastim with most of them expected to reach market ahead of SPI-2012. Notice almost all of them have much larger commercial infrastructure to support their biosimilar Neulasta than does SPPI. As increasing numbers of these competitors come to market, most sell side analysts expect pricing to come down for both the biosimilar products, as well as for brand Neulasta. As a reference, Amgen's Neupogen revenues have been declining faster than its volume, mainly due to a reduction in Neupogen price to combat biosimilar competition. Thus, we believe that when SPI-2012 reaches the market, if it actually does, the market size for long action G-CSF will be meaningfully smaller than the ~$4.6B market reported by Amgen in 2014.

In addition to a shrinking market, it is unclear to us whether there is a viable commercial strategy for SPI-2012. In the table below, we have presented the incentives for prescribers in the future when choices of long-acting G-CSF are plentiful. Note that this analysis is based on the assumption that SPI-2012 would not be priced at a premium to brand Neulasta, a reasonable scenario, in our opinion, given the undifferentiated profile and the likely number of competitors on the market. However, given SPPI's intention to market SPI-2012 as a brand drug, we have assumed SPI-2012 will be priced at a premium to biosimilar Neulasta. After thinking through the incentives, we could not come up with a reasonable scenario in which a doctor would prescribe SPI-2012 over brand and biosimilar Neulasta. Specifically, in our opinion, here is a non-exhaustive list of certain likely scenarios:
SPPI has repeatedly mentioned that SPI-2012 is not a biosimilar as if that is a competitive advantage. In making such a statement, we wonder whether SPPI and the bulls appreciate how reimbursement for biosimilar Part B drugs works. As part of the Affordable Care Act, it is our understanding that biosimilar Part B reimbursement is set to work differently from Part B reimbursement for generic drugs. In our opinion, this difference will serve as one of the key obstacles for SPI-2012 to gain adoption. For those who want to understand the details on how a biosimilar Part B drug is reimbursed under the Affordable Care Act, they can go to this article.
Here, we will summarize the key points and provide an illustrative example of why doctors would be incentivized NOT to prescribe SPI-2012. The reimbursement of a biosimilar is going to be ASP of the biosimilar, not volume-weighted ASP of brand and biosimilar, plus 6% of the reference drug's price. When combined with the 2% sequester cut on all Medicare payments, this means that a doctor will make more profit prescribing a biosimilar than the brand drug. Since SPI-2012 is a separate brand, its economics will be calculated as if it is a completely different brand drug. As one can see below, it seems that prescribers are heavily incentivized to prescribe biosimilar.


"We request immediate disclosure of formal and informal expressions of interest and/or non-binding offers to acquire the Company. If they have not already, I believe that multiple parties will offer to pay upwards of a 40% premium to the unaffected stock price at Friday's close."
Frankly, we do not see the value of this. We have no idea whether SPPI has received any formal or informal offers. But given that SPPI has just lost patent protection on Fusilev, a product that represents over 50% of its 2014 revenues, whatever offers it received prior to the district court ruling are, in our opinion, unlikely to be indicative of what it could get today.
We previously have provided our valuation analysis on SPPI's marketed products. We would point out that given the magnitude of year over year decline in revenues of Folotyn and Zevalin, by far SPPI's two largest marketed products outside of Fusilev, our valuation of $152M would need to be reduced. However, even if we generously use the $152M value, and add $34M of value for Evomela to it, the value of the marketed and near market drugs are only $186M, more than $400M below the ~$600M value claimed by Armistice.

If we look at the rest of pipeline, we just don't see where the value will come from as we detailed the challenges of SPI-2012 and apaziquone. We also don't believe poziotinib, an early phase breast cancer drug SPPI recently paid close to nothing for in March is all of a sudden worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, based on the abstract presented at ASCO, even the bullish RBC analyst does not appear to be impressed:

"Phase II poziotinib data (abstract #8085) showed some activity in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer who progressed on erlotinib and gefitinib (3/ 39 ?). However, the conclusion was that at least this study does not show poziotinib overcoming acquired resistance secondary to EGFR T790M mutations."
"We request that the Board of Directors immediately engage a top-tier investment bank and initiate a formal process to sell the Company."
If we look at the types of M&A deals that have been happening in the pharmaceuticals industry, they generally fall into three categories: (1) expensive but true innovations that could change the existing treatment paradigm (e.g., Pharmacyclics by Abbvie, Synageva by Alexion); (2) large cost cutting opportunities to generate near term accretion; and (3) ability to increase price on acquired products substantially to generate near term accretion (e.g., Cadence by Mallinkrodt, Marathon by Valeant). However, SPPI doesn't appear to us to fit into any of these three buckets. It is clear SPPI's portfolio is full of me-too products and lacks the true innovation we saw in some of these other deals. As we previously presented and according to FBR research as discussed earlier in this article, the value of SPPI's marketed drugs excluding SG&A and R&D costs not directly associated with these marketed products is, in our opinion, substantially below where the stock is currently trading. So, it will be difficult to envision how an acquirer can pay even current share price and create value from cutting costs. Lastly, given our discussions of SPPI's key products above, none of SPPI's products seems to us to possess pricing opportunities that a potential acquirer can unleash. So what does SPPI have that can attract a buyer? Not much in our opinion.
Despite filing its13D last week, it is unclear to us that Armistice will be able pressure the board of SPPI. It could be that Armistice has already discussed these suggestions with SPPI management in private and decided to make the letter public due to resistance from SPPI's management. However, it appears the timing is suboptimal. With the company's 2015 annual shareholder meeting already set on June 29, 2015, it may be too late for Armistice to bring the matter before the annual meeting under SPPI's bylaws.

"At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before such meeting. To be brought properly before an annual meeting of stockholders, business must be (NYSE:A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (NYSE:B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, or (NYSE:C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received no less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders"
In addition, according to the bylaws, shareholders do not have the right to force a special shareholder meeting. Thus, it appears that Armistice may need to wait more than a year until the next annual meeting in 2016 if it wants to take the next step in pressuring SPPI's management and board. Given the expected rapid deterioration of SPPI as generic Fusilev gains share, we believe it is likely that the already low value of SPPI's assets will decline even more over the next 12-15 months.
"Special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, or by the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting"

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
