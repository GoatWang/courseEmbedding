WaVe Life Sciences Appoints Roberto Guerciolini, M.D., as Senior Vice 
      President and Head of Early Development






April 07, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON & OKINAWA, Japan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--WaVe 
      Life Sciences today announced that Roberto Guerciolini, M.D., has 
      been appointed as Senior Vice President and Head of Early Development. 
      He was most recently Vice President and Product General Manager at Shire 
      and brings tremendous biopharmaceutical research and development 
      experience from lead identification through clinical development across 
      multiple therapeutic areas. Dr. Guerciolini will lead WaVe Life 
      Sciences’ translational and early clinical activities as the company 
      advances a pipeline of stereopure nucleic acid drug candidates across 
      multiple disease areas.
    


      "The addition of Dr. Guerciolini to our team continues WaVe’s trend of 
      attracting extremely talented and accomplished individuals to our 
      organization. He joins Dr. Chandra Vargeese, former head of RNA 
      chemistry and delivery at Novartis and his former colleague at Sirna, 
      where she was Vice President and head of chemistry. Chandra began 
      leading WaVe’s drug discovery efforts in August,” said Paul Bolno, M.D., 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of WaVe Life Sciences. “Roberto’s 
      incredible clinical and regulatory perspective is critical to enhancing 
      the success of our early program selection and development; he will be 
      instrumental in accelerating our Company’s transition from research to 
      development.”
    

      “WaVe is tackling the limitations inherent to complex mixtures of 
      oligonucleotides, and the Company’s platform for rational drug design 
      and precise chemical synthesis is infinitely applicable across 
      antisense, siRNA, mRNA, microRNA and beyond,” said Dr. Guerciolini. 
      “While the possibilities seem endless, WaVe is focused on very important 
      applications and building a pipeline that will demonstrate the 
      revolutionary potential of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics to 
      address important human diseases.”
    

      At Shire AG, a division of Shire plc in Switzerland, Dr. Guerciolini was 
      responsible for building an early-stage pipeline for its Specialty 
      Pharmaceuticals group. Prior to Shire, he was Senior Vice President of 
      Pharmaceutical Development at Dicerna, a company which he co-founded. 
      Previously, he was Senior Vice President of Development and Chief 
      Medical Officer of Sirna Therapeutics, which was acquired by Merck & Co. 
      in 2006. At Sirna, he led clinical development activities and regulatory 
      affairs, conducting the first ever clinical trial with a chemically 
      optimized siRNA. Prior to Sirna, he was Senior Director of Clinical 
      Pharmacology and Experimental Medicine at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, 
      where he was responsible for overseeing the conduct of early stage 
      clinical trials in the areas of oncology, inflammation and metabolic 
      diseases. While at Millennium, he also significantly contributed toward 
      the successful filing of an NDA for VELCADE®. Prior to this, he served 
      in clinical development at Roche, where he played an important role in 
      the filing and registration of XENICAL® in the U.S. and Europe, as well 
      as at Schering-Plough Corporation. Dr. Guerciolini received his Medical 
      degree and Board certification in Internal Medicine from the University 
      of Perugia Medical School in Italy. He completed a postdoctoral 
      fellowship in Clinical Pharmacology at the Mayo Clinic and is certified 
      by the American Board of Clinical Pharmacology. Dr. Guerciolini 
      additionally earned an executive MBA from the Haas School of Business, 
      University of California-Berkeley.
