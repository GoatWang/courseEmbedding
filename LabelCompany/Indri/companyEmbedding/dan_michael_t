Patent number:  9329966

If so, the electronic device may select and transmit and additional matrix code that may be decoded by the reader device to access and present an additional set of information regarding resolution of the error condition or to initiate an electronic device support request.

Ordering via dynamic matrix code generation



Patent number:  8386339
                                            

Abstract:  A content receiver receives ordering information from a content provider for orderable content or products. The content receiver also derives information specific to the content receiver and dynamically generates a matrix code including the ordering information and the specific information. The content receiver then transmits the matrix code to a display and when the displayed matrix code is detected and decoded by a reader, the reader initiates an order for the orderable content to be transmitted to the content receiver or products. In some implementations, the orderable content may be ordered from the content provider, which may then transmit the ordered content to the content receiver. However, in other implementations the orderable content may be ordered from a third party provider. As such, the third party provider may transmit the ordered content to the content provider, which may then transmit it to the content receiver.

Automatic reconfiguration device



Patent number:  8341690
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention provides a method and device that can easily configure an entertainment system automatically or semi-automatically. The reconfiguration of the entertainment system can be achieved by cycling through the possible configurations of the entertainment system (i.e. different combinations of operational states of the components that make up the entertainment system) by changing various operational states of certain components until an operable configuration is found. The invention may be implemented in any component of the entertainment system including a set-top-box, satellite receiver or a remote control.

Facilitating User Support of Electronic Devices Using Dynamic Matrix Code Generation



Publication number:  20120128267
                                            

Abstract:  An electronic device may derive information specific to the device, dynamically generate a matrix code that includes the information as well as user support information, and transmit the dynamically generated code to a display. When a user captures the matrix code with a reader device, the reader device may decode (or use a back end server to decode) the specific information specific and the user support information and initiate a user support request. Thus, user support for electronic devices may be facilitated utilizing dynamically generated matrix codes, such as (but not limited to) QR codes. In response to the initiated user support request, user support may then be provided for the user. Problems may be automatically taken care of for the user, tutorials may be provided for the user, one or more notifications may be provided to the user, service calls may be scheduled for the user, and so on.

Facilitating User Support of Electronic Devices Using Matrix Codes



Publication number:  20120131416
                                            

Abstract:  An electronic device detects occurrence of an error condition and selects a matrix code to include in an error message to transmit to a display device based on the error condition. A reader device decodes the displayed matrix code to present information regarding resolution of the error condition. The electronic device may select the matrix code by looking up the error condition in a table or by dynamically generate the matrix code. In various implementations, the electronic device may determine that the information regarding resolution of the error condition has been utilized to unsuccessfully resolve the error condition. If so, the electronic device may select and transmit and additional matrix code that may be decoded by the reader device to access and present an additional set of information regarding resolution of the error condition or to initiate an electronic device support request.

Ordering Via Dynamic Matrix Code Generation



Publication number:  20120130851
                                            

Abstract:  A content receiver receives ordering information from a content provider for orderable content or products. The content receiver also derives information specific to the content receiver and dynamically generates a matrix code including the ordering information and the specific information. The content receiver then transmits the matrix code to a display and when the displayed matrix code is detected and decoded by a reader, the reader initiates an order for the orderable content to be transmitted to the content receiver or products. In some implementations, the orderable content may be ordered from the content provider, which may then transmit the ordered content to the content receiver. However, in other implementations the orderable content may be ordered from a third party provider. As such, the third party provider may transmit the ordered content to the content provider, which may then transmit it to the content receiver.

Fixed Costs, Audit Production, and Audit Markets: Theory and Evidence

Abstract
We analyze the role of discretionary joint fixed costs in audit production. Given such costs, the investment decision and production of audit services must be analyzed over a client portfolio. We model this problem, and use monotone comparative statics (Milgrom and Shannon [1994]) to show the implications of variations in client-specific losses and the number of clients for the optimum level of fixed investment and audit assurance. We develop four hypotheses concerning the relations between audit quality and (1) the magnitude of potential client-specific losses; (2) average client losses in a portfolio; (3) the number of clients in a portfolio; and (4) the variability of losses in a portfolio. Using discretionary accruals as the audit quality proxy, we find evidence consistent with these hypotheses. Using PCAOB inspection results and financial statement restatements as proxies for audit quality, we find weaker evidence consistent with hypotheses 2, 3 and 4.
