Homepage In 1950, C.J Lindsay started Lindsay Co. The product line consisted of cutting tools for the machining industry. Two years later C.J. was joined by brother Harold and the two of them formed Lindsay Enterprises. As the company grew, a need was realized to manufacture special milling cutters using carbide inserts. With this background in carbide, Lindsay introduced the first carbide tipped debarker arms to the sawmill industry in the mid 1960's.
In 1981, Lindsay Forest Products, Inc was formed as a separate 
              entity to concentrate entirely on the Forest Industry. In the 1980's 
              manufacturing facilities were opened in Portland OR, Carthage, TX 
              and Chilliwack, BC, Canada. This new company was formed and run 
              by Dave Lindsay
Today 
              there are facilities in Vancouver, WA, Carthage, TX, and Chilliwac 
              BC. The Lindex Chipping Systems product line was formed in 
              1999 to promote and manufacture a new knife system for chippings 
              heads in the mills.

Debarker 


Tools & TipsReduce impact on tip while opening. Arms open quicker, reducing wear on arms. Less wear on machine parts because of quicker opening. Drop forged arms for superior strength. Arms also fabricated from Astralloy for strength and durability. New lighter design for improved barking performance. Fabricated arms with replaceable tool holders. Arms available with carbide lead edge.

Replacement Parts Lindsay sells quality replacement parts for debarkers. These replacement parts coupled with innovative airbag tension systems, tooling, infeed conveyors, feed rolls, and new or rebuilt rotors make Lindsay a complete debarker source. 


Lindsay Debarking Systems The LINDSAY air tool tensioning system is designed to give the best debarking results with minimum maintenance in all weather conditions. The system utilizes only two light weight moving parts that result in the best tool response and quality over knots and other irregularities. 

Feed ConveyorsThe addition of a LINDSAY self-centering log infeed conveyor into the debarker line greatly increases the efficiency while reducing the required maintenance of the debarker.
