Cenveo is a Fortune 1000 company based in Stamford, Connecticut engaged in the manufacture of various print-related products.[4] Found in 1921 as Denver-based Rockmont Envelope, the company's products and services include printed labels, packaging and digital print products, print magazine and book solutions, mailing solutions and creative services, and inventory and warehouse management software.[5]

History[edit]
Before changing its name to Cenveo, the company was known as Mail-Well, which was derived from Denver's Rockmont Envelope.[6] After changing ownership several times and acquiring and divesting various label and packing operations, the company changed its name to Cenveo in 2004.[7] Cenveo spent the next few years streamlining its product and service offerings, adding Cadmus Communications to its company lineup in 2007, which made Cenveo one of the "largest printing companies in North America." [8]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
Under its new name and corporate identity, Cenveo first attempted to purchase Banta Corporation, a Wisconsin-based printing and supply chain management company, in August 2006. The $1.21 billion offer was turned down by Banta's then-chairperson and CEO Stephanie Streeter, who then sold the company months later to RR Donnelley for $1.3 billion.[9][10]
After Cenveo successfully purchased Cadmus Communications in 2007, which gave Cenveo a stronger hold on the scientific and technical journal-printing market, it sought to add other companies to its expanding operations. Cenveo acquired Commercial Envelope and PC Ink, otherwise known as Printegra, also in 2007, which extended product and service offerings to the printed envelope, label and business form industry.[11][12]
Cenveo focused next on purchasing companies to expand its commercial offerings, buying California-based Madison/Graham ColorGraphics and Rex Corp. in 2007 and 2008, respectively.[13]
The company did not add another company to its growing list of acquisitions until 2009 when it purchased Nashua Corporation, which increased Cenveo's offerings in the specialty paper and pharmaceutical label industry.[14]
Cenveo also made acquisitions in the publisher services segment by acquiring Glyph International (2010)[15] and Nesbitt Graphics (2011),[16] both full service book production companies.
In 2012, Cenveo sold its Forms and Business Documents Group to Ennis.[17] In September 2013, Cenveo purchased the operating assets of its bankrupt competitor, National Envelope Corporation, for $25 million.[18]
By the end of 2015, the Burton family will have received over $70 million in compensation from their Cenveo employment.

History[edit]
Before changing its name to Cenveo, the company was known as Mail-Well, which was derived from Denver's Rockmont Envelope.[6] After changing ownership several times and acquiring and divesting various label and packing operations, the company changed its name to Cenveo in 2004.[7] Cenveo spent the next few years streamlining its product and service offerings, adding Cadmus Communications to its company lineup in 2007, which made Cenveo one of the "largest printing companies in North America." [8]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
Under its new name and corporate identity, Cenveo first attempted to purchase Banta Corporation, a Wisconsin-based printing and supply chain management company, in August 2006. The $1.21 billion offer was turned down by Banta's then-chairperson and CEO Stephanie Streeter, who then sold the company months later to RR Donnelley for $1.3 billion.[9][10]
After Cenveo successfully purchased Cadmus Communications in 2007, which gave Cenveo a stronger hold on the scientific and technical journal-printing market, it sought to add other companies to its expanding operations. Cenveo acquired Commercial Envelope and PC Ink, otherwise known as Printegra, also in 2007, which extended product and service offerings to the printed envelope, label and business form industry.[11][12]
Cenveo focused next on purchasing companies to expand its commercial offerings, buying California-based Madison/Graham ColorGraphics and Rex Corp. in 2007 and 2008, respectively.[13]
The company did not add another company to its growing list of acquisitions until 2009 when it purchased Nashua Corporation, which increased Cenveo's offerings in the specialty paper and pharmaceutical label industry.[14]
Cenveo also made acquisitions in the publisher services segment by acquiring Glyph International (2010)[15] and Nesbitt Graphics (2011),[16] both full service book production companies.
In 2012, Cenveo sold its Forms and Business Documents Group to Ennis.[17] In September 2013, Cenveo purchased the operating assets of its bankrupt competitor, National Envelope Corporation, for $25 million.[18]
By the end of 2015, the Burton family will have received over $70 million in compensation from their Cenveo employment.

How Confident Are Insiders About Cenveo Inc (CVO)?



Blake Harford 


            				July 27, 2017			        


 Cenveo, Inc. provides print related products in the United States and internationally. CVO is one of United States’s large-cap stocks that saw some insider buying over the past three months, with insiders investing in 484,064 shares during this period. Generally, insiders buying more shares in their own firm sends a bullish signal. A research published in The MIT Press (1998) concluded that stocks following insider buying outperformed the market by 4.5%. But these signals may not be sufficient to gain confidence on whether to invest. I’ve assessed two potential reasons behind the insiders’ latest motivation to buy more shares.

Is This Consistent With Future Growth?
 

 Cenveo (NYSE:CVO) Future Profit Jul 27th 17
 
 From the outside, there are dark clouds on the horizon for Cenveo. Delving deeper into the line items,CVO is believed to experience negative growth in its top-line over the next year, which indicates the company may be facing some headwinds. This is expected to impact its bottom line next year given the large negative growth rate expected, indicating cost-cutting may not be able to pull it through into a positive growth region yet. However, company insiders appear to know something the market doesn’t and have been investing more money into the stock. This may mean they believe in a turnaround or believe the stock is well-undervalued by negative market sentiment. 
Did Stock Price Volatility Instigate Buying?
 Another factor we should consider is whether the timing of these insider transactions coincide with any significant share price movements. This means, if insiders believe shares were heavily undervalued recently, this would provide a prime opportunity to buy more irrespective of its growth outlook. Within the past three months, Cenveo’s share price traded at a high of $6.49 and a low of $4.44. This suggests a fairly large volatility with a share price movement of 46.17%. Insiders may deem this relatively meaningful movement as an opportunity to increase their shareholdings. Or perhaps their reason to buy is not driven by price or growth prospects and merely by their own personal portfolio needs. 
Conclusion
 Tracking insider trading can be a valuable barometer of broad shifts in the sector and company sentiment. And it is undoubtedly encouraging to buy or sell a stock knowing insiders have done the same. Their confidence can be gauged by when and how much they trade. CVO’s net buying tells us the stock is in favour with some insiders, although the expected earnings growth challenges this conclusion, while a relatively volatile share price could be the motivation to trade. 
 Although insider trading can be a useful prompt, following the lead of an insider, however, will never replace diligent research.

Cenveo is a Fortune 1000 company based in Stamford, Connecticut engaged in the manufacture of various print-related products.[4] Found in 1921 as Denver-based Rockmont Envelope, the company's products and services include printed labels, packaging and digital print products, print magazine and book solutions, mailing solutions and creative services, and inventory and warehouse management software.[5]

History[edit]
Before changing its name to Cenveo, the company was known as Mail-Well, which was derived from Denver's Rockmont Envelope.[6] After changing ownership several times and acquiring and divesting various label and packing operations, the company changed its name to Cenveo in 2004.[7] Cenveo spent the next few years streamlining its product and service offerings, adding Cadmus Communications to its company lineup in 2007, which made Cenveo one of the "largest printing companies in North America." [8]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
Under its new name and corporate identity, Cenveo first attempted to purchase Banta Corporation, a Wisconsin-based printing and supply chain management company, in August 2006. The $1.21 billion offer was turned down by Banta's then-chairperson and CEO Stephanie Streeter, who then sold the company months later to RR Donnelley for $1.3 billion.[9][10]
After Cenveo successfully purchased Cadmus Communications in 2007, which gave Cenveo a stronger hold on the scientific and technical journal-printing market, it sought to add other companies to its expanding operations. Cenveo acquired Commercial Envelope and PC Ink, otherwise known as Printegra, also in 2007, which extended product and service offerings to the printed envelope, label and business form industry.[11][12]
Cenveo focused next on purchasing companies to expand its commercial offerings, buying California-based Madison/Graham ColorGraphics and Rex Corp. in 2007 and 2008, respectively.[13]
The company did not add another company to its growing list of acquisitions until 2009 when it purchased Nashua Corporation, which increased Cenveo's offerings in the specialty paper and pharmaceutical label industry.[14]
Cenveo also made acquisitions in the publisher services segment by acquiring Glyph International (2010)[15] and Nesbitt Graphics (2011),[16] both full service book production companies.
In 2012, Cenveo sold its Forms and Business Documents Group to Ennis.[17] In September 2013, Cenveo purchased the operating assets of its bankrupt competitor, National Envelope Corporation, for $25 million.[18]
By the end of 2015, the Burton family will have received over $70 million in compensation from their Cenveo employment.

History[edit]
Before changing its name to Cenveo, the company was known as Mail-Well, which was derived from Denver's Rockmont Envelope.[6] After changing ownership several times and acquiring and divesting various label and packing operations, the company changed its name to Cenveo in 2004.[7] Cenveo spent the next few years streamlining its product and service offerings, adding Cadmus Communications to its company lineup in 2007, which made Cenveo one of the "largest printing companies in North America." [8]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
Under its new name and corporate identity, Cenveo first attempted to purchase Banta Corporation, a Wisconsin-based printing and supply chain management company, in August 2006. The $1.21 billion offer was turned down by Banta's then-chairperson and CEO Stephanie Streeter, who then sold the company months later to RR Donnelley for $1.3 billion.[9][10]
After Cenveo successfully purchased Cadmus Communications in 2007, which gave Cenveo a stronger hold on the scientific and technical journal-printing market, it sought to add other companies to its expanding operations. Cenveo acquired Commercial Envelope and PC Ink, otherwise known as Printegra, also in 2007, which extended product and service offerings to the printed envelope, label and business form industry.[11][12]
Cenveo focused next on purchasing companies to expand its commercial offerings, buying California-based Madison/Graham ColorGraphics and Rex Corp. in 2007 and 2008, respectively.[13]
The company did not add another company to its growing list of acquisitions until 2009 when it purchased Nashua Corporation, which increased Cenveo's offerings in the specialty paper and pharmaceutical label industry.[14]
Cenveo also made acquisitions in the publisher services segment by acquiring Glyph International (2010)[15] and Nesbitt Graphics (2011),[16] both full service book production companies.
In 2012, Cenveo sold its Forms and Business Documents Group to Ennis.[17] In September 2013, Cenveo purchased the operating assets of its bankrupt competitor, National Envelope Corporation, for $25 million.[18]
By the end of 2015, the Burton family will have received over $70 million in compensation from their Cenveo employment.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
