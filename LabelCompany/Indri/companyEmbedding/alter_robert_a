Product Description▼▲
The story of David is the greatest single narrative representation in antiquity of a human life evolving by slow stages through time, shaped by the pressures of political life, family, the impulses of body and spirit, and the eventual sad decay of the flesh. In its main character, it provides the first full-length portrait of a Machiavellian prince in Western literature.. "The beautiful, musical David, loved by all, resourceful slayer of Goliath, is revealed through his life to be a calculating political animal. To advance his own cause, he becomes a collaborator with the archenemies of Israel, the Philistines. Later he commits adultery with Bathsheba, and compounds the betrayal with murder. But through the author's empathy and skill, David also emerges as a fully realized character, a man of passion and intelligence who navigates the ambiguities of belief, loyalty, ambition, temptation, and circumstance with uneven success.

Acclaimed for its masterful new translation and insightful commentary, "The David Story" is a fresh, vivid rendition of one of the great works in Western literature. Alter's translation paints not only the heroic picture of David in his fight with Goliath, but also portrays David as an ambitious, calculating man with a flawed vision.

A seminal text




By Robert, Nov 05 2012

I'd been meaning to read this book for years and am very glad I finally got the opportunity to do so! This book was a watershed when it was first published some 30 years ago, not so much because it approached the Bible was a 'great work of literature,' but because it attended to the Hebrew text of the Old Testament in a literary way. There is actually a big difference here. It is easy to wax lyrical about how the Bible contains great stories and powerful legends and culture-forming narrative, like Homer or Shakespeare. Well, 'The Art of Biblical Narrative' is nothing like that - not even close. What Altar does is he analyses the Hebrew of the Bible for its literary characteristics, such as repetition and characterisation, and shows was a brilliant book it is and how artfully it is constructed. But most importantly, he shows how  easily confessional readings can miss the point, such as attributing David's repetition of "My son, my son" to different sources. I will never forget Altar's comparison of how both the donkey and Balak rebuke their masters three times - the whole story reverses those who 'see' into the 'blind' and those with 'power' into the 'powerless'. The challenge of this book is to realise how fun reading the Bible ought to be, and to let yourself accept that. What a wonderful challenge that is!

Product Description
Publisher’s Description Through a distinguished career of critical scholarship and translation, Robert Alter has equipped us to read the Hebrew Bible as a powerful, cohesive work of literature. The culmination of this work, his masterly new translation and probing commentary combine to give contemporary readers the definitive edition of The Five Books of Moses.
The Five Books of Moses is an enduring source of literary and spiritual renewal. In its powerful narrative we find the primal stories of the Creation and expulsion from the Garden of Eden. The intimacies of Genesis portray the tortuous relations between gathers and sons, husbands and wives. The grand historical narrative of Exodus and Numbers conveys a still–resonant drama of enslavement and liberation. Leviticus and Deuteronomy codify a culture and ensure its transmission over generations.
Alter’s majestic translation recovers the mesmerizing effect of these ancient stories—the profound and haunting enigmas, the ambiguities of motive and image, the distinctive cadences and lovely precision of the Hebrew text. Other modern translations either recast these features for contemporary clarity, thereby losing the character of the original, or fail to five readers a suitably fluid English as a point of contact. Alter’s translation conveys the music and the meaning of the Hebrew text in a lyrical, lucid English. His accompanying commentary illuminates the text with learned insight and reflection on its literary and historical dimensions.
Our age has been graced by brilliant English translations of Homer, Dante, Cervantes, and others. We can now add The Five Books of Moses to the list of great literary works reanimated for our time.

Description












                                            A recipient of the Robert Kirsch Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Los Angeles Times, Hebrew and American literature professor Robert Alter's ongoing translation of the Hebrew Bible won the 2005 PEN Center USA Literary Award for Translation. In this volume the poetry in the Book of Job is restored to its powerful ancient meanings and rhythms; the account of creation in its Voice from the Whirlwind passage is beautiful and incendiary, an unforgettable challenge to the place of man in the universe. In Ecclesiastes, the serene fatalism that construes life as ephemeral and without purpose suffuses the text with a quiet beauty. And the pithy maxims of Proverbs impart a worldly wisdom that is still sound and satirically shrewd. Each of these books both conveys and undermines the universal wisdom that the righteous thrive and the wicked suffer in a rational moral order; together they are essential to the ancient canon that is the Hebrew Bible, and in Alter's translation they regain the energy and force of the original."Magnificent: This translation is superb [and] the commentary is rich in linguistic, historical, and literary insights that immeasurably enrich the reading of these texts."�Library Journal

Product Description
Publisher’s Description To read the books of the Former Prophets in this riveting Robert Alter translation is to discover an entertaining amalgam of hair–raising action and high literary achievement. Samson, the vigilante superhero of Judges, slaughters thousands of Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. David, the Machiavellian prince of Samuel and Kings, is one of the great literary figures of antiquity. A ruthless monarch, David embodies a life in full dimension as it moves from brilliant youth through vigorous prime to failing old age. Samson and David play emblematic roles in the rise and fall of ancient Israel, a nation beset by internal divisions and external threats. A scattering of contentious desert tribes joined by faith in a special covenant with God, Israel emerges through the bloody massacres of Canaanite populations recounted in Joshua and the anarchic violence of Judges. The resourceful David consolidates national power, but it is power rooted in conspiracy, and David dies bitterly isolated in his court, surrounded by enemies. His successor, Solomon, maintains national unity through his legendary wisdom, wealth, and grand public vision, but after his death Israel succumbs to internal discord and foreign conquest. Near its end, the saga of ancient Israel returns to the supernatural. In Elijah’s fiery ascent to heaven many would find the harbinger of a messiah coming to save his people in their time of need.

                Alter's rare combination of fluent translation and insightful commentary makes this the perfect edition of Genesis for anyone drawn to this formative work in our culture. With a translation that attends to the usages, rhythms, and narrative patterns of biblical Hebrew and a commentary which deepens readers' understanding of Genesis without being intrusive, this book is ""the" Genesis for our generation and beyond" (Robert Fagles).

                Genesis begins with the making of heaven and earth and all life, and ends with the image of a mummy-Joseph's-in a coffin. In between come many of the primal stories in Western culture: Adam and Eve's expulsion from the garden of Eden, Cain's murder of Abel, Noah and the Flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham's binding of Isaac, the covenant of God and Abraham, Isaac's blessing of Jacob in place of Esau, the saga of Joseph and his brothers. In Robert Alter's brilliant translation, these stories cohere in a powerful narrative of the tortuous relations between fathers and sons, husbands and wives, eldest and younger brothers, God and his chosen people, the people of Israel and their neighbors.
