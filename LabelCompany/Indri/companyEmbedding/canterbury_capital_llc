THE LONG VIEW Canterbury Capital makes long-term equity investments, primarily with its own equity capital. Canterbury is currently focused on micro-cap manufacturing and business service company investments that are generally overlooked by the broader private equity industry. Although we are always open to looking at unique situations.Long Term PerspectiveWith no pre-determined sale timeline, Canterbury retains each investment until an appropriate opportunity to accelerate company growth presents itself. There is no 5-7 years and out here.Overlooked by the MarketSo you've got a great business that doesn't fit the strict acquisition criteria of traditional market participants. That doesn't mean you don't have a great business. Our flexible structures, broad views and long-term perspective provide the ability to adapt to many deal situations.Not just about EBITDAFinancial returns are important but so are opportunities for your team. We look to provide a suitable return on our invested capital while also providing growth and opportunities for both the company and its team. We believe great companies are built when everyone wins.
