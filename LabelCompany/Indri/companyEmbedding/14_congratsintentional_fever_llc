DeCoster Sentencing in Sioux City Reveals Many Sides of the Story | Food Safety News

DeCoster Sentencing in Sioux City Reveals Many Sides of the Story 
By
Dan Flynn | April 14, 2015


At Monday’s sentencing that took just short of five hours, the man who was once the largest egg producer in the U.S. finally got to tell his side of the story, one victim’s father spoke for thousands of others, and a lively and talkative judge sometimes left one of the nation’s top defense attorneys searching for words.
U.S. District Court Judge Mark W. Bennett first acknowledged that there was nothing ordinary about the sentencing of Austin “Jack” DeCoster, his son, Peter DeCoster, and their Quality Egg LLC. The judge said he spent more time preparing for this sentencing than any of the nearly 4,500 others he has handed down in the past 20 years.
The federal courthouse in Sioux City, IA.
And if there was not already enough anxiety in the courtroom, Bennett said he was still making up his mind about the sentences to impose, causing the courtroom audience to hang on his words. Was it more important that Bennett said he found the Salmonella outbreak that occurred under the DeCosters’ watch to be “shameful,” or that he admires Jack DeCoster as a truly self-made man and Peter DeCoster for his missionary work in sometimes dangerous parts of the world?
During the wait for the judge’s sentence to be imposed, it became increasingly obvious that Jack DeCoster had something to say. At breaks, he paced and spent little time chitchatting with family members who were present in the ornate Sioux City courtroom.
His chance came during the time when defendants have the opportunity to speak directly to the judge before sentencing. It came with a warning from Bennett that such statements can help or hurt a defendant, or make no difference whatsoever.
For Jack DeCoster, that warning seemed to make little difference as he did have something to say. It was something he probably wanted to say ever since the summer 2010 Salmonella outbreak that forced him to recall more than a half-billion eggs.
DeCoster started off in a halting manner, wondering whether the judge could hear him. Bennett was all ears.
“Feel we did a lot,” DeCoster told the court. He tried appealing to the judge’s logic by asking what egg producer would “not take care of his chickens properly?” He told of a problem that for his company began in Maine, not in Iowa, and caused him to put his faith in vaccines.
His work on the issue began in 2008, finding that it took two vaccines to stem Salmonella levels in his chicken flocks. After the success in Maine, he focused on the Iowa flocks but had not reached the second vaccines before the outbreak hit.
DeCoster said his fight against Salmonella ended because “we ran out of time.” He said they ran into trouble with the vaccines because of the negative impact the doses were having on the chickens’ immune systems.
He also wanted Bennett to know that he liked the judge, part of that admiration stemming from the fact that Bennett is the same judge who sentenced him in 2003 for hiring more than 100 illegal aliens, some just over the border, to work for his egg operations.
“Whatever you do with me,” DeCoster said, “I think you are a great judge.”
U.S. District Court Judge Mark W. Bennett
But when it finally came around to the sentencing, it didn’t appear that DeCoster’s telling of his vaccine story carried much weight with the judge. Before producing the sentences, Bennett read into the record large parts of the Pre-Sentencing Investigative Report detailing practices on the egg farms that he said were part of the culture that led to the 2010 Salmonella outbreak and the historic recall.
The passages the judge read into the record included activities such as doctoring audits and other food safety documents.
Before that, however, Bennett heard additional arguments the attorneys wanted to make about whether someone convicted of a so-called “strict liability” misdemeanor could be incarcerated for the offense. Jack DeCoster’s Sidney Austin attorneys, including Thomas C. Green, have maintained that jail time is not an option.
Both father and son pleaded guilty to the same “strict liability” misdemeanor of allowing adulterated food to enter instate state commerce. In doing to, they admitted no personal knowledge of the crime, only responsibility as corporate officials.
Since 1918, when Supreme Court Associate Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo was still on New York Court of Appeals, a doctrine has existed that a judge cannot take someone’s liberty without premeditated conduct, DeCoster attorney Mark D. Hopson said.
Bennett called the argument Green and Hopson were making “a novel idea.” In the end, the judge said that if zero jail time was to be the rule for conviction of a strict liability misdemeanor, it should be done by Congress or the Sentencing Guidelines Commission. He acknowledged that the 8th Circuit U.S Court of Appeals might rule differently, but he was not taking the possibility of incarceration off the table.
The court also heard from Jason Tucker, a Dallas farmer whose son, now 8, was sickened five years ago by the Salmonella pathogen from DeCoster eggs.
“He was almost unrecognizable to us,” Tucker said.
The combination of high fever and antibiotic treatments left the boy with a troubling aftereffect, namely that his adult teeth are coming in without being hard enough. It means that the boy must get stainless steel caps, which his father said is making him self-conscious and inclined to “cover his smile.”
“I mean it breaks my heart to see that he is going to have metal teeth until he is old enough to get implants,” Tucker said.
The boy was one of nearly 2,000 victims with confirmed cases and nearly 60,000 who were likely infected by the contaminated DeCoster eggs.
Jack and Peter DeCoster
When he returned from lunch, Bennett sentenced both of the DeCosters to three months in jail and and one year of supervised probation. The judge set the jail time aside until appeals in the case run their course.
The judge also let all fines stand as were originally outlined in the plea agreement entered last June 3. A total of $7 million has been paid: $6.8 million from Quality Egg LLC and $100,000 each from the two men.
Quality Egg, which is essentially now bankrupt, and the DeCosters also share responsibility for paying a restitution amount of $83,008.19. In addition, the company forfeited $10,000 as part of the plea agreement.
Quality Egg, an egg production company with operations in Wright County, IA, pleaded guilty to one count of bribery of a public official and one count of introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce with intent to defraud, both felonies, and one count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce, a misdemeanor.
Jack and Peter DeCoster each pleaded guilty to one count of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce.  In the plea agreements, the company and the father and son admitted that the company’s shell eggs were adulterated in that they contained a poisonous and deleterious substance, Salmonella Enteriditis, which may have rendered the eggs injurious to health.
During the spring and summer of 2010, adulterated eggs produced and distributed by Quality Egg were linked to thousands of consumer illnesses in multiple states — a nationwide outbreak of salmonellosis that led to the largest raw shell egg recall in U.S. history.
“The message this prosecution and sentence sends is a stern one to anyone tempted to place profits over people’s welfare. Corporate officials are on notice. If you sell contaminated food, you will be held responsible for your conduct.  Claims of ignorance, or ‘I delegated the responsibility to someone else,’ will not shield them from criminal responsibility,” said U.S. Attorney Kevin W. Techau for the Northern District of Iowa.
Former Quality Egg employee Tony Wasmund, 64, of Willmar, MN, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to one count of conspiracy to bribe a public official, selling restricted eggs with intent to defraud, and introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce with intent to defraud and mislead. Wasmund is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Bennett on May 15.
Also revealed during Monday’s sentencing:

His attorneys said Jack DeCoster has made charitable contributions totaling $16 million in the past four years. As he sold off his egg businesses from Maine to Iowa, the Irrevocable DeCoster Trust has reached a value close to $300 million.
The employee charged with bribing a now-deceased USDA egg inspector was once Peter DeCoster’s brother-in-law. There was no evidence that DeCoster had prior knowledge of the transaction.
If they do report for jail, Jack DeCoster would prefer a local county jail in Iowa, while Peter DeCoster’s choice would be a federal minimum security facility in Yankton, SD.

Good recounting of the hearing.

“…talkative judge sometimes left one of the nation’s top defense attorneys searching for words.”
Would’ve liked to read something about that.
I was beginning to feel some sympathy for these two until it got to the parts about illegally hiring illegal aliens (with their stellar hygiene), bribery, intentional fraud, intentional misbranding, the poor suffering little boy and the DeCosters’ possibly SIXTY-THOUSAND other victims. 
The judge should have fried ’em, like eggs.






MaryFinelli



“He tried appealing to the judge’s logic by asking what egg producer would ‘not take care of his chickens properly?’” 
To read how horrifically DeCoster treated workers, Google: Factory farmer Austin “Jack” DeCoster sentenced to prison––but will he really do time? 
Try to imagine how much worse the birds at his mercilessness fared. Per the September 6, 2010 issue of Feedstuffs: “Austin ‘Jack’ DeCoster, who has a history of citations related to environmental, immigration, worker pay and safety and animal care violations at his egg…operations in Iowa, Maine and elsewhere…”
Egregious cruelty to animals is standard practice in animal agriculture, and particularly with factory farming. If you don’t want to be the cause of it, be vegan.

The DeCosters are criminals who belong in prison for life. I remember years ago when it was disclosed that these pathological thugs sprayed nicotine around their suffering hens for some reason I can’t now recall. What I do recall is the report of the hens’ agony compounding the agony they already endured being locked in De Coster’s filthy cages, unable to move their limbs, in chronic pain as a result of their beak amputations. The De Costers have created pure misery for humans and hens. This is their legacy. I do not support the death penalty in part because there are people sitting on death row, or who have been executed, whose felonies do not begin to compare with the criminality of the De Costers whose punishment, including a sentence of death, could never compensate for the evil they have perpetrated. They embody the worst characteristics of our species. Karen Davis, United Poultry Concerns http://www.upc-online.org

“asking what egg producer would “not take care of his chickens properly?” Well, here’s a answer for deCoster, and most of the others of his ilk. What constitutes “properly” is a completely subjective, race to the bottom, unregulated and abysmal level. Lot of slave owners said the same thing, meaning, if the “profit generating unit” (chicken, person, any animal) is still alive and pumping out product, that’s “good ’nuff” The god-awful conditions of the industrial egg production barns this guy kept should be front and center evidence kept consistently in view—manure piled up 5 ft deep and bulging out the sides of the barns, ammonia levels so high as to cause permanent eye damage, disgusting conditions kept out of sight. This is the industry the DeCosters try to defend.

What's In Your Personal Care Products?

By Mary Jo DiLonardo





From the WebMD Archives




It smells good. It feels good on your child's skin. And all her friends are using it. But is it the healthiest choice?
When it comes to choosing shampoos, lotions, and other personal products for your kids -- or helping them make good choices -- it's not an easy question to answer. That’s because although there’s been a great deal of attention about chemicals like phthalates, parabens, and formaldehyde found in many personal care products, it's not clear what the risks are, if any.
While some manufacturers are voluntarily removing a handful of controversial chemicals from their products, you'll still find a number of chemicals in everything from moisturizer to makeup. American teens and adolescents, who tend to like to experiment with new personal care products, may be getting more chemical exposure than American women. In a 2008 study by the Environmental Working Group, 20 teenage girls used 17 products a day, five more than the average U.S. woman. The study found 16 chemicals with potentially harmful health effects in blood and urine samples of the girls, aged 14 to 19.
Many parents assume that ingredients in personal care products are safe or they wouldn’t be allowed to be used. But that’s not necessarily the case, says David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization.
“Premarket safety testing is not something that’s necessarily done for cosmetics or personal care products,” says Andrews. “I know it was eye-opening for me -- the lack of information on the health and safety of the chemicals that end up in our everyday products.”
Here’s a look at three of the more common controversial chemicals and the science behind whether they could be harmful to your kids.

Phthalates

Phthalates work as softeners in personal care products such as cosmetics and shampoo, as well as flexible plastics like children’s toys. Several studies -- both in animals and humans -- have found that phthalates might have some effects on hormones.
Two phthalate studies that attracted a lot of media attention were conducted by Shanna Swan, PhD, an epidemiologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Both looked at how phthalates exposure in pregnant women might affect their sons.


Continued


One study showed that 3- to 6-year-old boys of women who had high levels of phthalates during pregnancy were less likely to engage in “typical male” type play such as play-fighting and playing with trucks. The other study showed that 1-year-old boys of mothers in the high-phthalates group showed signs of impaired production of testosterone, the male sex hormone.
While experts agree that more research is needed to determine whether phthalate exposure affects male fertility, Swan believes that it may affect the development of boys. “We know phthalates are in these products. We know they get in our bodies. The debate comes over how risky they are,” she says. 
In another study in 2008, high levels of phthalates were found in the urine of babies that were recently soaped or slathered with baby shampoo, powder, or lotion. There was no connection made to the amount of phthalates and any reproductive problems, but the study got a lot of attention because the questionable chemicals were in products especially targeted toward babies.
In 2008, Congress banned specific levels of certain phthalates (BBP, DEHP, and DBP) in toys, citing studies showing the toxic effects of these substances. The EPA is adding eight phthalates to their “Chemicals of Concern” list, meaning the agency will keep a close watch on the chemicals with more stringent limitations -- and even banning -- possible in the future.
“We recommend looking to avoid phthalates,” says Andrews. “One of the concerns is that we know the chemicals end up in the bloodstream.”
But if you want to avoid these chemicals, it’s not as simple as shopping for products without phthalates listed on the ingredient label. It’s often difficult to know if phthalates are in a product because manufacturers aren’t required to list the specific chemicals that make up fragrances -- and those fragrances can often contain phthalates, which are used to make smells last longer. To be sure, look for labels that say “no phthalates” or “phthalate-free.”
“The level of risk you want to assume and how cautious you want to be is a personal choice,” says Swan. “Some people will go out of their way to avoid every conceivable risk and some will say they aren’t going to worry about anything. Most people fall somewhere in between.”


Continued

Formaldehyde

That stinky chemical that kept your frog intact in high-school science class may be a preservative in your home, found in some of your family’s cosmetics and other personal care products.
There’s little debate that formaldehyde can pose health risks. Short-term exposure can cause skin irritation from physical contact or wheezing, watery eyes, and burning in the nose when inhaled.
The long-term effects of formaldehyde exposure are less certain. After research found that formaldehyde exposure caused cancer in rats, the Environmental Protection Agency classified the chemical as a “probable carcinogen.” The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified formaldehyde as a human carcinogen.
But the amount of formaldehyde used in grooming products and cosmetics is much smaller than the amounts tested in most studies, making it hard to draw firm conclusions about risk.
Formaldehyde limits for personal care products are set by the Consumer Ingredient Review -- an independent scientific review group funded by the personal care products industry and supported by the FDA and the Consumer Federation of America. The CIR set healthy product limits in 1984 and then revisited them in 2002.
“There was a wealth of new literature all repeating the same studies that high levels of formaldehyde caused cancer,” says CIR Director F. Alan Andersen, PhD, who spent 22 years with the FDA as a regulatory scientist. “So we’re pretty comfortable that we know how the industry is using it and they’re below the levels we’ve established.”
However, if you want to keep your kids from all personal care products containing formaldehyde, you may have difficulty. A recent study commissioned by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics in conjunction with the  Environmental Working Group, found formaldehyde in baby lotion, baby bubble bath, and baby shampoo. The chemical was not an intentional ingredient but was a byproduct of the manufacturing process.

Parabens

Parabens are some of the most commonly used preservatives in cosmetics such as moisturizers, shampoos and conditioners, and many types of makeup. In the Environmental Working Group study of teenage girls, all 20 participants tested positive for two parabens: methylparaben and propylparaben.


Continued


Parabens entered the radar of environmental advocacy groups because several studies have found parabens in tissue samples of breast cancer tumors. However, those studies were far from conclusive and were unable to show a direct connection between paraben exposure and an increased risk of breast cancer.
Because parabens are typically used at levels between 0.01% and 0.3% and have been deemed safe in cosmetics at levels as high as 25%, the FDA official stance is that currently there’s no reason for consumers to be worried about using cosmetics that contain parabens. However, the FDA continues to evaluate the chemicals.
If you are concerned, it’s relatively simple to tell if parabens are in a product your child wants to try. Check the label and look for ingredients such as propylparaben, benzylparaben, methylparaben, or butylparaben.

Looking for Healthy Products

As environmental advocacy groups such as Environmental Working Group point out, the ingredients in cosmetics and personal care products are not regulated. Indeed, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act gives no authority to the agency to approve cosmetic ingredients -- except for specific coloring additives in certain hair dyes.
According to the FDA’s web site, “Cosmetic manufacturers may use any ingredient they choose, except for a few ingredients that are prohibited by regulation.”
However, you can check products for many chemicals -- such as phthalates, parabens, and formaldehyde -- by visiting the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database. The online guide looks at the safety of more than 7,600 ingredients in nearly 62,000 products. You can use it to narrow the cosmetics field to find potentially healthier products.
Until there are comprehensive safety standards for personal care products, read the labels for suspect ingredients in the makeups and lotions your teen is clamoring to use. And use common sense. Mary Beth Genter, a toxicologist and editor-in-chief of International Journal of Toxicology from the American College of Toxicology, says, “Everything depends on the level of exposure.”
