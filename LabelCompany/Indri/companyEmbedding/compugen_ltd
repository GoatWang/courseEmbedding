Operations[edit]
Compugen operates in two areas of the biotechnology industry: it develops and markets bioinformatics software platforms and engages in in silico drug discovery.[2] Over the years it has partnered with companies the likes of Pfizer, Bayer, Novartis, Abbott, BioLineRx, and Seattle Genetics.[3][4][5][6][7] Roche and Five Prime Therapeutics are among Compugen's competitors.[8]
Pipeline[edit]
CGEN-15029[edit]
CGEN-15029 is the lead agent in their immuno-oncology product portfolio.[9]
History[edit]
Compugen was founded in 1993 by Eli Mintz, Simchon Faigler and Amir Natan. Mintz conceived of the idea for the company in 1991 while accompanying his wife, Liat Mintz, to a genomics engagement at the Pasteur Institute in France. She commented that the quantities of data being produced by scientists involved in DNA sequencing exceeded what computers could process at reasonable speeds. Eli Mintz partnered with colleagues Faigler and Natan from the IDF's elite Talpiot program to develop a more powerful computer; and indeed, the company's first computer, dubbed the "Bioccelerator," boasted speeds up to one thousand times faster than other platforms being used at the time.[2][10][11] In 1997, the company followed this success by introducing LEADS, an EST clustering and assembly platform.[12][13] By around 2001, Compugen had effected a shift in its business model from a company whose almost exclusive focus was marketing computer programs and applications to one whose operations extended into the diagnostics and therapeutics fields.[14][15]
Compugen began trading on the Nasdaq in 2000 and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2002.[16] Also in 2002, Compugen spun off its subsidiary Evogene, established as an agriscience division in 1999.[17][18]
Management[edit]
Mor Amitai, Hebrew University alumnus (Ph.D, Mathematics), who joined Compugen in 1994, was the company's CEO and president from 1998 to 2005. He was replaced by Alex Kotzer, Technion alumnus (Chemical Engineering), who was CEO and president through 2008.[19][20][21][22] Anat Cohen-Dayag, Weizmann Institute alumnus (Ph.D, Cellular Biology), became co-CEO of Compugen in 2009, serving alongside Martin Gerstel, Yale alumnus (Engineering). She has been the company's exclusive CEO since 2010.[23][24]

Operations[edit]
Compugen operates in two areas of the biotechnology industry: it develops and markets bioinformatics software platforms and engages in in silico drug discovery.[2] Over the years it has partnered with companies the likes of Pfizer, Bayer, Novartis, Abbott, BioLineRx, and Seattle Genetics.[3][4][5][6][7] Roche and Five Prime Therapeutics are among Compugen's competitors.[8]
Pipeline[edit]
CGEN-15029[edit]
CGEN-15029 is the lead agent in their immuno-oncology product portfolio.[9]
History[edit]
Compugen was founded in 1993 by Eli Mintz, Simchon Faigler and Amir Natan. Mintz conceived of the idea for the company in 1991 while accompanying his wife, Liat Mintz, to a genomics engagement at the Pasteur Institute in France. She commented that the quantities of data being produced by scientists involved in DNA sequencing exceeded what computers could process at reasonable speeds. Eli Mintz partnered with colleagues Faigler and Natan from the IDF's elite Talpiot program to develop a more powerful computer; and indeed, the company's first computer, dubbed the "Bioccelerator," boasted speeds up to one thousand times faster than other platforms being used at the time.[2][10][11] In 1997, the company followed this success by introducing LEADS, an EST clustering and assembly platform.[12][13] By around 2001, Compugen had effected a shift in its business model from a company whose almost exclusive focus was marketing computer programs and applications to one whose operations extended into the diagnostics and therapeutics fields.[14][15]
Compugen began trading on the Nasdaq in 2000 and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2002.[16] Also in 2002, Compugen spun off its subsidiary Evogene, established as an agriscience division in 1999.[17][18]
Management[edit]
Mor Amitai, Hebrew University alumnus (Ph.D, Mathematics), who joined Compugen in 1994, was the company's CEO and president from 1998 to 2005. He was replaced by Alex Kotzer, Technion alumnus (Chemical Engineering), who was CEO and president through 2008.[19][20][21][22] Anat Cohen-Dayag, Weizmann Institute alumnus (Ph.D, Cellular Biology), became co-CEO of Compugen in 2009, serving alongside Martin Gerstel, Yale alumnus (Engineering). She has been the company's exclusive CEO since 2010.[23][24]

Operations[edit]
Compugen operates in two areas of the biotechnology industry: it develops and markets bioinformatics software platforms and engages in in silico drug discovery.[2] Over the years it has partnered with companies the likes of Pfizer, Bayer, Novartis, Abbott, BioLineRx, and Seattle Genetics.[3][4][5][6][7] Roche and Five Prime Therapeutics are among Compugen's competitors.[8]
Pipeline[edit]
CGEN-15029[edit]
CGEN-15029 is the lead agent in their immuno-oncology product portfolio.[9]
History[edit]
Compugen was founded in 1993 by Eli Mintz, Simchon Faigler and Amir Natan. Mintz conceived of the idea for the company in 1991 while accompanying his wife, Liat Mintz, to a genomics engagement at the Pasteur Institute in France. She commented that the quantities of data being produced by scientists involved in DNA sequencing exceeded what computers could process at reasonable speeds. Eli Mintz partnered with colleagues Faigler and Natan from the IDF's elite Talpiot program to develop a more powerful computer; and indeed, the company's first computer, dubbed the "Bioccelerator," boasted speeds up to one thousand times faster than other platforms being used at the time.[2][10][11] In 1997, the company followed this success by introducing LEADS, an EST clustering and assembly platform.[12][13] By around 2001, Compugen had effected a shift in its business model from a company whose almost exclusive focus was marketing computer programs and applications to one whose operations extended into the diagnostics and therapeutics fields.[14][15]
Compugen began trading on the Nasdaq in 2000 and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2002.[16] Also in 2002, Compugen spun off its subsidiary Evogene, established as an agriscience division in 1999.[17][18]
Management[edit]
Mor Amitai, Hebrew University alumnus (Ph.D, Mathematics), who joined Compugen in 1994, was the company's CEO and president from 1998 to 2005. He was replaced by Alex Kotzer, Technion alumnus (Chemical Engineering), who was CEO and president through 2008.[19][20][21][22] Anat Cohen-Dayag, Weizmann Institute alumnus (Ph.D, Cellular Biology), became co-CEO of Compugen in 2009, serving alongside Martin Gerstel, Yale alumnus (Engineering). She has been the company's exclusive CEO since 2010.[23][24]

Operations[edit]
Compugen operates in two areas of the biotechnology industry: it develops and markets bioinformatics software platforms and engages in in silico drug discovery.[2] Over the years it has partnered with companies the likes of Pfizer, Bayer, Novartis, Abbott, BioLineRx, and Seattle Genetics.[3][4][5][6][7] Roche and Five Prime Therapeutics are among Compugen's competitors.[8]
Pipeline[edit]
CGEN-15029[edit]
CGEN-15029 is the lead agent in their immuno-oncology product portfolio.[9]
History[edit]
Compugen was founded in 1993 by Eli Mintz, Simchon Faigler and Amir Natan. Mintz conceived of the idea for the company in 1991 while accompanying his wife, Liat Mintz, to a genomics engagement at the Pasteur Institute in France. She commented that the quantities of data being produced by scientists involved in DNA sequencing exceeded what computers could process at reasonable speeds. Eli Mintz partnered with colleagues Faigler and Natan from the IDF's elite Talpiot program to develop a more powerful computer; and indeed, the company's first computer, dubbed the "Bioccelerator," boasted speeds up to one thousand times faster than other platforms being used at the time.[2][10][11] In 1997, the company followed this success by introducing LEADS, an EST clustering and assembly platform.[12][13] By around 2001, Compugen had effected a shift in its business model from a company whose almost exclusive focus was marketing computer programs and applications to one whose operations extended into the diagnostics and therapeutics fields.[14][15]
Compugen began trading on the Nasdaq in 2000 and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2002.[16] Also in 2002, Compugen spun off its subsidiary Evogene, established as an agriscience division in 1999.[17][18]
Management[edit]
Mor Amitai, Hebrew University alumnus (Ph.D, Mathematics), who joined Compugen in 1994, was the company's CEO and president from 1998 to 2005. He was replaced by Alex Kotzer, Technion alumnus (Chemical Engineering), who was CEO and president through 2008.[19][20][21][22] Anat Cohen-Dayag, Weizmann Institute alumnus (Ph.D, Cellular Biology), became co-CEO of Compugen in 2009, serving alongside Martin Gerstel, Yale alumnus (Engineering). She has been the company's exclusive CEO since 2010.[23][24]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
