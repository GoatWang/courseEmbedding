Maintain the hair you have and help prevent additional thinning with our leading techniques.


Solutions
Rogaine
Propecia

Problem
Advanced Hair Loss

Using today’s latest advances in hair restoration, hair is taken from the donor area, which consists of the follicles around the sides and back of the head. Our state-of-the-art techniques minimize scarring and maximize results to provide the most natural-looking outcome possible. Every patient’s experience is unique, and our customized treatment plans are tailored to your singular needs and goals.
