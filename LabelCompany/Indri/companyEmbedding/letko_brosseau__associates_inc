June 17, 2011

IN THE MATTER OF
THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF
QUÉBEC AND ONTARIO
(the Jurisdictions)
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
THE PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF
APPLICATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
LETKO, BROSSEAU & ASSOCIATES INC.
(the Filer)
DECISION
Background
The securities regulatory authority or regulator in each of the Jurisdictions (Decision Maker) has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdictions (the Legislation) providing an exemption from the requirement in section 13.5(2) b) iii) of National Instrument 31-103 -- Registration Requirements and Exemptions that prohibits a registered adviser from knowingly causing an investment portfolio managed by it, including an investment fund for which it acts as an adviser, to purchase or sell a security from or to the investment portfolio of an investment fund for which a responsible person acts as an adviser, to permit (each purchase and redemption, an In Specie Transaction):

a) the purchase by a Fund (defined below) of securities of another Fund, and the redemption of securities held by a Fund in another Fund, and as payment for such purchase or redemption, in whole or in part, by making good delivery of portfolio securities that meet the investment objectives of that Fund; and
b) the purchase by a Managed Account (defined below) of securities of a Fund, and the redemption of securities held by a Managed Account in a Fund, and as payment:

i) for such purchase, in whole or in part, by the Managed Account making good delivery of portfolio securities to the Fund; and
ii) for such redemption, in whole or in part, by the Fund making good delivery of portfolio securities to the Managed Account.

(the Exemption Sought).
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a dual application):

a) the Autorité des marchés financiers is the principal regulator for this application,
b) the Filer has provided notice that section 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, and
c) the decision is the decision of the principal regulator and evidences the decision of the securities regulatory authority or regulator in Ontario.

Interpretation
Terms defined in the Legislation, National Instrument 14-101 Definitions and MI 11-102 have the same meanings if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined.
Fund means an investment fund managed by the Filer or managed in the future by the Filer to which National Instrument 81-102 -- Mutual Funds does not apply.
Managed Account means an account over which the Filer has discretionary authority.
Certain other defined terms have the meanings given to them above or below.
Representations
This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:

1. The Filer is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act, with its head office in Montreal, Quebec.
2. The Filer is registered as a portfolio manager in Québec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador.
3. The Filer is also registered as investment fund manager in Québec.
4. Each Fund is, or will be, an investment fund established as a trust or corporation under the laws of Canada or a jurisdiction of Canada.
5. The Filer is, or will be the manager and portfolio manager of each of the Funds.
6. Desjardins Trust Inc. acts as trustee, where applicable, and custodian of each of the Funds.
7. The Funds are not, and will not be, reporting issuers in any jurisdiction of Canada.
8. Securities of the Funds are, or will be, distributed pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirements in each jurisdiction of Canada.
9. The Filer and each of the Funds are not in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction of Canada.
10. The Filer is also the portfolio manager of each of the Managed Accounts.
11. Each client who wishes to receive the investment management services of the Filer executes a written agreement (the Letter of Appointment) whereby the client appoints the Filer to act as portfolio manager in connection with an investment portfolio of the client.
12. Pursuant to the Letter of Appointment, the Filer has discretionary authority to trade in securities for the Managed Account without obtaining the specific consent of the client to execute the trade, including investing the Managed Account in Funds for which the Filer is the portfolio manager and for changing those Funds as the Filer determines in accordance with the investment objectives of the Managed Accounts.
13. To ensure that neither the Managed Account nor a Fund incurs significant expenses related to the disposition and acquisition of portfolio securities in connection with the purchase or redemption of securities of a Fund, the Filer proposes to facilitate such purchases and redemptions of the Funds securities by doing In Specie Transactions.
14. The Filer may determine that in lieu of holding individual securities, a Managed Account would be better served to be invested in one or more of the Funds. As a result, the Filer desires to have such Managed Accounts subscribe for securities of the relevant Funds in the form of an In Specie Transaction. Further, future clients of the Filer may have an existing portfolio of securities when they retain the Filer such that the Filer may similarly desire to have the clients subscribe for securities of the relevant Funds in the form of an In Specie Transaction, provided these securities are appropriate for the Fund.
15. In addition, due to portfolio changes for a Managed Account, the Filer may determine to redeem securities of a Fund held by a Managed Account in the form of an In Specie Transaction and subscribe for securities of another Fund or Funds in the form of an In Specie Transaction or simply hold the individual portfolio securities in the Managed Account. Alternatively, the client may determine to terminate its relationship with the Filer or to change its investment objectives and may request a redemption of its securities in a Fund in the form of an In Specie Transaction.
16. The Filer may also determine that a Fund needs exposure to certain investments or categories of asset classes invested by another Fund and would be better served by investing in securities of that Fund. As a result, the Filer wishes to be able to enter into In Specie Transactions between Funds.
17. At the time of an In Specie Transaction, the Filer will have in place policies and procedures to enable the Funds and Managed Accounts to engage in In Specie Transactions with Funds and Managed Accounts, as applicable:

a) prior to engaging in In Specie Transactions on behalf of a Managed Account, the Letter of Appointment or other documentation in respect of the Managed Accounts will contain the authorization of the client for the Filer to engage in In Specie Transactions;
b) the compliance officer of the Filer will pre-approve each In Specie Transaction in connection with the purchase of securities of the Fund and each payment of redemption proceeds in the form of an In Specie Transaction;
c) the portfolio securities transferred in an In Specie Transaction will meet the investment objectives of the Fund or Managed Account, as the case may be, acquiring the portfolio securities;
d) Desjardins Trust Inc. will value the portfolio securities under an In Specie Transaction using the same values that are used to calculate the net asset value for the purpose of the issue price or redemption price of securities of the Fund;
e) none of the portfolio securities which are the subject of each In Specie Transaction will be securities of related issuers of the Filer; and
f) the Fund will keep written records of each In Specie Transaction, including records of each purchase and redemption of portfolio securities and the terms thereof for a period of five years commencing after the end of the financial year in which the trade occurred, the most recent two years in a reasonably accessible place.

18. Effecting In Specie Transactions of securities between a Fund and a Managed Account and between two Funds will allow the Filer to manage each asset class more effectively and reduce transaction costs for the client and the Fund or the two Funds. For example, such trading reduces market impact costs, which can be detrimental to the clients and/or the Fund(s). In Specie Transactions also allow a portfolio manager to retain within its control institutional-size blocks of securities that otherwise would need to be broken and re-assembled.
19. The only cost which will be incurred by a Fund or Managed Account for an In Specie Transaction is an administrative charge levied by the custodian of the Fund in recording the trades.
20. As the Filer is, or will be, the manager and portfolio manager of the Funds and the portfolio manager of the Managed Accounts, as applicable, the Filer would be considered a "responsible person" within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Legislation. Accordingly, absent the granting of the Exemption Sought, the Filer would be prohibited from engaging in In Specie Transactions.

Decision
Each of the Decision Makers is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the Decision Maker to make the decision.
The decision of the Decision Makers under the Legislation is that the Exemption Sought is granted provided that:

a) in connection with an In Specie Transaction where a Managed Account acquires securities of a Fund:

i) the Letter of Appointment or other documentation in respect of the Managed Account contains the authorization of the client for the Filer to engage in the In Specie Transactions;
ii) the Fund would, at the time of the payment, be permitted to purchase the securities;
iii) the securities are acceptable to the Filer as portfolio manager of the Fund and meet the investment objectives of the Fund;
iv) the value of the portfolio securities is equal to the issue price of the securities of the Fund for which they are used as payment, valued as if the securities were portfolio assets of that Fund;

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
