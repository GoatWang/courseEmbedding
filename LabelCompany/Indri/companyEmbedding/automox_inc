The investment will enable Automox to hire more development talent and increase the pace of new product feature releases.Automox is the first company to offer a fully automated platform capable of patching any OS, any software, in any location, eliminating the biggest challenge associated with maintaining patch security - staying protected against new threats. Automox is providing companies of any size access to affordable enterprise-class patching technology that doesn't require additional servers or involve complex setup and configuration. Automox's vision is to enable every company to be 100% patched, 100% of the time. "Patching is the single most impactful security action you can take," said Jay Prassl, Founder and CEO of Automox. "Keeping systems and software consistently patched can reduce your attack surface by up to 90%. With those odds you would think everyone would patch. But the reality is that patching in a complex and geographically dispersed environment is extremely difficult, costly, and time consuming."Cisco's 2017 Cybersecurity Report states that only 72 of every 1,000 threats are remediated, leaving 92% of threats unpatched and open to cyber attacks. The looming security question for corporations is not if a breach will occur but when, and vulnerabilities, like the one exposed by the WannaCry malware attack in May, exist inside every company. With Automox, companies can ensure that all of their systems and software are patched. "For the majority of companies, unpatched systems are a huge security risk," commented Chris Marks, Managing Director at Blue Note Ventures. "IT managers are under huge pressure to provide critical services while improving network security. Automating this critical aspect of corporate security allows IT managers to focus on other more demanding security tasks."Prassl also believes Automox can help companies stay compliant with cyber insurance guidelines. "The majority of cyber policies exclude coverage for losses arising from 'failure to take reasonable steps to design, maintain and upgrade its security.' This means if you file a claim, and the audit shows that you were not patched, the claim might not get paid. The cost of not knowing your patch vulnerability status could be devastating."About AutomoxAutomox's cloud-based platform fully automates patch remediation across Windows, Linux, Mac, and 3rd party software. Automox's simple, manageable process reduces patching time and resources by 90%. Automox also enables management of system configuration and continuous infrastructure monitoring and inventory, providing greater security, improved productivity, and radical time savings. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/automox-inc-launches-company-with-13m-round-bringing-patch-confidence-and-greater-security-to-companies-of-every-size-300489717.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHere's Trump's approval rating in every stateBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredDonald Trump thinks Jeff Bezos is his biggest threatYahoo FinanceConservative media outlets are sending Trump a big warning on Jeff Sessions — and Trump is paying attentionBusiness InsiderEconomists answer, are we at full employment?Yahoo Finance VideoA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredFacebook earnings, Fed announcement — What you need to know in markets on WednesdayYahoo FinanceSenate opens 'Obamacare' debate at last but outcome in doubtAssociated PressChina's army looks like it's getting ready for something big to go down in North KoreaBusiness InsiderWomen Everywhere Should Carry This Tiny DeviceSiren SongSponsoredOil bounce, results keep stocks on highReutersFormer Obama official weighs in on Trump's plan to bring back manufacturing jobsYahoo Finance VideoWhy Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are fightingYahoo FinanceStart Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredMotorola's Moto Z2 Force is a smartphone guaranteed not to shatterYahoo FinanceA conspiracy theory about Chipotle is gaining steamBusiness InsiderSenate Judiciary Committee withdraws subpoena for ManafortNOTconformed777: The Senate withdraws subpoenas for Manafort and Trump Jr. And so the coverup begins.Join the Conversation1 / 5427
