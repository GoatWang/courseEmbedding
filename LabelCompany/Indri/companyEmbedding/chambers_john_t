Technology’s older generation of rebels has now almost completely disrupted itself.Over the last few years, longtime leaders of industry giants like Microsoft, Oracle, Intel and IBM have stepped down, in departures that signal the passing of one tech era and the beginning of another. In many cases, their successors now struggle with updating their companies, which were largely built in a world of personal computers and packaged software, for one of mobile devices, cloud computing, sensors and software everywhere.On Monday, perhaps the last veteran leader of the old guard signaled it was time to leave the corner office — if only for a move down the hall. John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems since 1995, said he was stepping down effective July 26, to be succeeded by a longtime Cisco sales executive.“He is the last of the lions, presiding over years of incredible growth,” said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, a market research firm.

Mr. Chambers’s successor, Charles H. Robbins, is 49, and joined Cisco, the networking equipment maker, in 1997, just two years after Mr. Chambers became C.E.O. Mr. Chambers, 65, will remain as executive chairman. The company said that Mr. Chambers would spend time supporting the company’s new chief and “engaging closely with customers and governments around the world.” Continue reading the main story

The transition is another sign of a generational shift in Silicon Valley. In September, Lawrence J. Ellison announced he would leave the C.E.O. position at Oracle, the world’s largest maker of database software. Like Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ellison became the company’s executive chairman and remains active.

In August 2013, Steven A. Ballmer said he would step down as head of Microsoft, and he was succeeded in February 2014 by Satya Nadella. Unlike Mr. Ellison or Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ballmer cut his ties with Microsoft and left the board in August. He now gives commands from the courtside of the Los 
Angeles Clippers basketball team, which he purchased for $2 billion in May 2014.In addition, just months before Mr. Ballmer announced his decision to step down as Microsoft chief, there was a passing of the guard at the chip maker Intel, with Brian M. Krzanich becoming chief executive to succeed Paul S. Otellini. The year before, in 2012, Virginia M. Rometty took the place vacated by Samuel J. Palmisano as head of IBM.Even as the executive suites at these large companies have turned over, a web-focused and mobile-proficient group of companies now dominate the technology scene, including Facebook and Google. Many of these are run by much younger leaders than Mr. Chambers, especially Google’s Larry Page, 42, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, 30. Their companies have powerful networks but are primarily devoted to software, and an ethos that information should be ubiquitous and shared.“Now it’s a young man’s game,” Mr. Colony said.Cisco makes much of the gear that runs the Internet, notably digital information switches. It also supplies equipment for the world’s telecommunications infrastructure, and for teleconferencing, video and Wi-Fi networks. It had sales of $47.1 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, compared with $1.2 billion in 1994, just before Mr. Chambers took over.Investors appeared to take the news of the executive shift in stride. Cisco stock closed at $29.17, up 4 cents.Yet the world Mr. Robbins is facing is unquestionably changing, and in a way that is fundamentally different from what Cisco is good at, Mr. Colony noted.


            A Cisco Era Closes        

            Under John T. Chambers, who will step down in July as chief executive, Cisco was briefly the world’s most valuable company. Even after the Internet boom, it remained an industry leader.

"Chuck is going to have to break a lot of glass and change a lot of culture at Cisco,” he said.In a call with reporters alongside Mr. Chambers, Mr. Robbins said he would “be looking at ways to support our current strategy,” parts of which he might tweak to move faster.

Mr. Chambers and Mr. Robbins said Cisco would stress its recent forays into building networks for Internet-connected sensors, the so-called Internet of Things. Companies like General Electric and Google have been working extensively in this area as well. Mr. Robbins indicated that Cisco would be investing more in areas like computing and data storage, to add more value to its products.

Mr. Chambers, who has been active in Republican politics, said he “probably won’t” run for office. “My wife is my high school sweetheart,” he said, “I plan on spending more time with her than I have in many years.”Under Mr. Chambers, Cisco became the world’s dominant networking equipment provider. The rise came on a combination of technical excellence, aggressive acquisitions, and Mr. Chambers’s irrepressible salesmanship. For a brief period during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, Cisco was the world’s most valuable company.Yet the stock has struggled for much of the 15 years since the bubble burst, forcing Mr. Chambers to spend billions buying back Cisco’s shares. The shares are at their highest since 2007, though still less than half their value in 2000.Increasingly, Cisco is facing new competitors offering cheap systems consisting largely of off-the-shelf chips and software, instead of Cisco’s proprietary technology. Companies that were once allies, like Dell and EMC, have also become rivals. Dell now sells switches based on open-source software. A company largely owned by EMC, VMware, owns a substantial software-based networking business.


            Highlights From the Archives        

            Mr. Chambers, 65, who became head of the company in 1995, has been one of the longest serving chiefs of a major publicly traded technology company.        



 



Mr. Chambers at first dismissed the new technologies, but lately has offered products with more software, as well as a place for Cisco’s older components. Cisco also began focusing on the Internet of Things.So far it is a modest business, with a lot of competitors — particularly among an old guard looking for a new act.Ms. Rometty at IBM has also made smarter systems a priority, spending several billion dollars on cloud computing and related technology. At Intel, Mr. Krzanich has pushed into both mobile devices and machines to crunch the loads of data created by big new computing systems. And at Microsoft, Mr. Nadella last week held a conference for independent software developers to work on Microsoft’s cloud and mobile products, along with new technologies like three-dimensional goggles.

Along with these competitors, Cisco faces new aspirants, who work more with off-the-shelf components and software. One of these companies is Arista Networks, which is staffed by several former Cisco executives. Mr. Chambers sued Arista last December, citing patent infringement. Arista fired back, calling Cisco’s actions “a smear campaign.”Mr. Robbins will be running Cisco under the close watch of Mr. Chambers, who in the eyes of some Cisco watchers is only nominally leaving the corner office.“He’s from the same cloth as John, a sales guy,” said Timothy Zimmerman, an analyst with Gartner. “The major issue is that there has to be a stronger hand in product creation.”Mr. Robbins must also contend with the fact that Mr. Chambers’s nonstop salesmanship over the last two decades, along with the departure of so many executives over the years, has made him very much the public face of Cisco.

Chambers, John T.
Business Leader Profiles for Students 
COPYRIGHT 2002 The Gale Group, Inc.




Chambers, John T.(1949-)
Cisco Systems Inc.OverviewAn impassioned promoter of electronic commerce and all that the Internet has to offer, John T. Chambers heads Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of data networking equipment. Since taking over as Cisco's chief executive officer in January 1995, Chambers has led the company from annual sales of $1.2 billion to nearly $22.3 billion in fiscal 2001, which ended July 31, 2001. A born salesman, Chambers has helped his company to win control of nearly two–thirds of the international market for the switches and routers that power the Internet and connect networks. He has also positioned the company to compete for a larger share of the telecommunications market with its line of products able to carry data, voice, and video traffic. So effectively has Chambers preached the Net religion that fellow executives in the business have been made to sit up and take notice. Eric E. Schmidt, chief executive of software maker Novell Inc., said of the Cisco CEO: "Chambers has made himself into the No. 1 communicator of the networked vision." Chamber's effectiveness as a salesman for the Internet has not escaped the attention of the nation's top leaders. A few years back, President Bill Clinton and Vice–President Al Gore described the Cisco CEO as "a true leader in this industry, in America's economy, and in the global economy." Clinton and Gore hailed Cisco as "one of the most respected companies, not only in [the networking] field, but in any field."Personal LifeChambers was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 23, 1949. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to



Charleston, West Virginia, where he grew up. Both his mother and father were physicians. As a boy, he struggled with dyslexia, but his parents hired a private tutor who helped Chambers to overcome this disability. So well did he overcome it, in fact, that he graduated second in his high school class. He attended West Virginia University in Morgantown, where he earned his bachelor's degree in business administration in 1971. He went on to Indiana University in Bloomington for his master's degree in finance and management and later returned to Morgantown to earn a law degree.Chambers and his wife, Elaine, live in Los Altos Hills, California, not far from the executive suites of Cisco in nearby San Jose. The couple has two children, a daughter, Lindsay, and a son, John. When not traveling about the country extolling the virtues of the Internet and networking in general, Chambers enjoys fishing and tennis.Career DetailsChambers began his business career in 1976 at IBM, where he remained for six years before moving on to Wang Laboratories. During his eight–year stay at Wang,



Chambers as vice–president was forced to lay off some 5,000 employees, an experience he found profoundly disturbing. So disturbing, in fact, that he abruptly left Wang, even though he had not yet landed another job. Of the massive layoff at Wang, he later said, "I'll do anything to avoid that again."In 1991, Chambers joined Cisco as senior vice–president of worldwide operations. The company at that point had annual sales of about $70 million. In the fall of 1994, Cisco's board announced Chambers' appointment as president and chief executive officer, effective in January 1995. By 2001, Cisco had increased its annual revenue to more than $22 billion, a phenomenal increase due in no small part to the leadership of Chambers.Almost from the start, Chambers began selling the Internet and networking with missionary zeal. In a November 1997 interview with ZD COMDEX, Chambers predicted that "companies that don't adopt networking and the Internet will be left behind, regardless of their size. The productivity gains are too large. Every major aspect of how business will be done will be affected by this new technology." And Cisco has certainly been practicing what Chambers preached. The company transacts more than 80 percent of its business over the Internet. More than that, Chambers has made Cisco a shining example of the productivity gains that can be achieved through use of the Internet, both by speeding up most processes and sharply reducing costs. Every corporate function—including customer support, finance, manufacturing, and human resources—at Cisco is performed through Net systems, winning a reduction of $1.5 billion in costs between 1996 and 1999. Chambers himself is obsessed with customer satisfaction. Every night before he retires, he routinely listens to ten or so voice–mail messages from staffers in the field who have phoned in reports on the status of Cisco's top accounts.Asked by ZD COMDEX about the challenges likely to face companies seeking to implement a network–centric approach to doing business, Chambers conceded that companies will have to make some significant adjustments. "The first is there are five to maybe ten applications that are the big payback applications. You want to select the right applications at the right time for your industry. . . . The second is to really think about how your network is going to work and what the true cost of the network is. . . . And the third thing is to determine what they are going to do themselves and what they're going to look for their partners to help them do in the implementation of the network."To speed Cisco's growth and diversify its product base, Chambers has engineered the acquisition of more than 60 companies since becoming the CEO. A key area he has targeted for growth is the telecommunications sector, envisioning a time in the not–too–distant future when "data, voice, and video will be delivered over a single connection in our homes." In Chambers' vision, Cisco's vast data networks could in time become the world's leading voice networks. Cisco's maneuvers in the telecommunications arena will not go unchallenged. As the longtime telecommunications leaders become increasingly Internet–savvy, they are moving to head off Cisco's move into the sector. In mid–1998, Nortel bought Bay Networks Inc., a longtime rival of Cisco.

Chambers has traveled the country to promote the new world that has been opened up by the Internet for business and consumers alike. He spends nearly half his time on the road, spreading his message. In his keynote address at ComNet '97 in Washington, D.C., Chambers used several examples to press his case for connecting companies globally and to prove how pervasive both networking and the Internet have become. He pointed out that at a growing number of colleges, the traditional college library has been replaced by the World Wide Web and term papers are submitted via e–mail. He also pointed to the rapidly growing number of company meetings conducted through videoconferencing.Chronology: John T. Chambers1949:   Born.1971:   Graduated with B.A./B.S. in business from West Virginia University.1974:   Graduated with J.D. from West Virginia University.1976:   Began business career at IBM.1982:   Moved to Wang Computers.1991:   Joined Cisco Systems Inc. as SVP, worldwide sales and operations.1994:   Named Cisco's president and CEO.1995:   Assumed position as president and CEO.

1997:   Cisco transacted one–third of world's electronic commerce.2000:   Given Internet Industry Leader Award by U.S. Internet Council.In selling the Internet around the world, Chambers often cites a University of Texas study, commissioned by Cisco, that predicts that by 2010 electronic commerce will account for roughly a quarter of the world's gross national product. Companies that fail to take advantage of the Internet's business potential, he warns, very likely will face irrelevancy.In August of 2001, Chambers announced major changes in Cisco's organizational structure, changes designed to help the company better serve its customers. At the heart of the changes was a move from Cisco's line of business structure to centralized engineering and marketing organizations. In announcing the restructuring, Chambers said, "Our line of business structure has served us very well in the past, when customer segments and product requirements were very distinct. Today, the differences have blurred between these customer segments, and Cisco is in a unique position to provide the industry's broadest family of products united under a consistent architecture designed to help our customers improve productivity and profitability."Chambers speaks with a slight southern twang, but nobody is likely to mistake him for a country bumpkin. He was once described as "a West Virginia choirboy who will eat you for lunch." The Cisco CEO expresses unshakable confidence in the future of his company, predicting that "there's no reason Cisco can't be the most successful company in history. Perhaps the highest market cap, but also the most generous with its employees, with payback for its shareholders and also the best giver to the community." One indicator of Cisco's generosity to its employees came when Forbes magazine named it the third–best company to work for. ABC News' 20/20 magazine show dubbed Chambers the "best boss in America."In addition to being a big booster for the Internet, Chambers has been a major cheerleader for the development of San Jose, the California city that serves as Cisco's headquarters. He has proposed massive office complexes on the northern and southern edges of the city, expansions that would allow Cisco to triple its workforce in the San Jose area. Perhaps the biggest project planned by Cisco has been the construction of a $1 billion corporate park in San Jose's Coyote Valley. The complex would house up to 20,000 Cisco employees. Chambers isn't above using strong–arm tactics to get what he wants for Cisco. After he announced his plan for the Coyote Valley office complex in 1999, he made it clear that he could take Cisco's business elsewhere if the necessary approvals weren't handled expediently. "It takes one phone call to North Carolina," he said. "It's a much easier place to do business." Although Chambers' threat ruffled the feathers of some of San Jose's city fathers, "a lot of us were cheering," said San Jose Chamber of Commerce President Steve Tedesco. "Finally somebody could tell the city like it is."Social and Economic ImpactChambers has not only guided Cisco to phenomenal success, but he's been a passionate advocate for electronic commerce and the Internet. He's traveled the world to convince government and business leaders how important it is that they embrace the new Net economy. "We're living through the second Industrial Revolution," he tells all who will listen. And for those who may be tempted to ignore his warning and let the Internet bandwagon pass them by, he warns: "You can be Amazoned in a moment."Chambers has molded Cisco into one of the biggest and most successful companies of all time, while at the same time ensuring that the company's employees look upon their employer as concerned and sensitive about their needs. In this arena, he's been amazingly successful, having won the plaudits of ABC News' 20/20 as "America's best boss" and having Cisco consistently rated among the best places to work in countless surveys. It's not hard to understand when you hear Chambers talk about his personal credo as Cisco's CEO: "Never ask your employees to do something you wouldn't be willing to do yourself."Chambers hasn't neglected his civic duties either. He has a long and admirable record of philanthropy, ranging from sponsorship of the world's first Internet–based charity concert to forking over $1 million for a San Jose area community center. Among the causes about which Chambers cares the most is education. A couple of years back, he contributed a quarter of a million dollars of his own money to help get a measure making it easier to build and repair schools on the California ballot. An enthusiastic supporter of the Republican Party, he has served as an adviser to President George W. Bush and also co–chaired the Technology Network, which pushes for legislation that will foster the growth of this country's high–tech sector.Sources of InformationContact at: Cisco Systems Inc.

Where to start

Making the decision going to college, pursuing an advanced degree or obtaining an industry recognized certificate is one of the most important decisions an individual will make in their lifetime. When considering an educational institution there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account before an education decision can be made. 
Here are the main factors to consider when looking at pursuing an advanced degree or completing a certificate program:
Online VS In Person: This is the first fundamental question that prospective students need to ask themselves. If you are the kind of person that is self driven, has a tight schedule or is not in a commutable distance to an in person institution, then pursuing an online degree could be a good fit. However, if you find yourself needing to be in a physical classroom environment and learn better that way, then you should seek out in person programs that can better suite your needs. People learn in all different kinds of ways. Some are visual learners, some experiential and some need to hear things to have the information really sink in. No one knows himself or herself better than you, so listen to your gut and first determine what kind of learner you are before embarking on the next steps. Rasmssen College goes into greater depth about the plusses and minuses of online v.s. traditional educational settings. 
Career Opportunities: When exploring areas of study that you are interested in, one recommendation is to first explore the types of jobs and careers in that industry. Often times people find that after obtaining a degree that has set them back a significant amount of money, that the career field that they have their degree in is either not growing or is underpaid in relation to the cost of the degree. We suggest exploring a variety of careers and use the information contained here in conjunction with The Bureau of Labor and Statistics Data to determine if you are making a wise investment in your degree. All of the statistics we have assembled on career and degree data come from the BLS website and are intended to help students make wise decisions about their studies and career options with a degree or certificate. 



 
Time Commitment: The amount of time that you have available to apply to your studies is going to be one of the most important factors in your decision. If you are working a full time job, you will have to figure out a way of balancing your personal life, with your schoolwork. This article from US News and World Report will help you come up with a game plan for managing your time
Financial Aid, Scholarships and Student Loans: Once you have decided that you want to go to college and have a career path planned out once you obtain your degree, then it’s time to figure out how to pay for the degree. Most institutions have different financing options that you will have to do your homework on, but all usually have some form of financial aid or scholarships available. When looking for information on student aid and the resources available to students, we recommend starting at the Federal Student Aid website. This is an office of the U.S. Department of Education and here, students will find a wealth of resources and information that will help them better determine what kind of aid or grants are available to them.

Q&A: John Chambers - MIT Technology Review































































Business Impact

Q&A: John Chambers


The executive chairman of Cisco has become a Silicon Valley statesman, whether he’s promoting the expansion of digital networks or calling for limits on government surveillance.


					by 
Jason Pontin

June 14, 2016
























Cisco Systems designs, makes, and sells the routers, switches, and other networking equipment with which businesses connect their computers, manage data centers, and access the Internet. Since its founding in 1983 as a maker of multiprotocol routers, it has survived every market change through aggressive acquisition, sometimes of competing technologies. John Chambers, who led much of Cisco’s growth, retired as CEO in 2015, after 20 years, but continues to serve as executive chairman. Jason Pontin, MIT Technology Review’s editor in chief, spoke to Chambers in India, where he was conferring with Narendra Modi about the prime minister’s campaign to bring Internet access and services to the country’s vast population.
What are the challenges in giving online access to nearly everyone in the world?

The number one objective is that people who make the investment in digitization, whether they are governments or service providers, get a reasonable return. Some programs have not moved as aggressively as I would like, like in the United States. Others are very aggressive, like India’s. The numbers in Andhra Pradesh are just amazing. They think they can bring 10 to 15 megabytes to the home for $2.50 per month. That’s a magical number in terms of local family income, because anything below 2 percent per capita income is when you really get broad penetration. If it’s successful, India will be a model for other countries to follow.

How important is the industrial Internet—the Internet of things—to Cisco’s future?
Extremely important. It’s connectivity that really makes the industrial Internet work: it’s giving the right information at the right time to the right person or right machine to make the right decision. That decision can be on the manufacturing shop floor. It can be in a supply chain. It can be in the retail store to your customer. It can be in how you service that product remotely, either in a home or a mining site. 
Aren’t you a little concerned about the security of these devices?
Organized crime and rogue nation states and terrorists are very much focused on the Internet of things. The challenge that goes with connectivity is always security. The bad guys go wherever the return is, and now it’s more lucrative for bad guys to focus on cybercrime than traditional crime. Japan had 54 billion cyberattacks and issues last year, up 100 percent over the prior year.
Edward Snowden showed that the NSA intercepted Cisco equipment and installed backdoors. You complained that the NSA had undermined trust in U.S. tech companies. Do you see evidence that any standards of conduct on government surveillance will be approved?
It’s taking longer than all of us, including government leaders, would like. But I think the discussion between the president of China and the president of the U.S. was constructive. They are making reasonable progress on corporate espionage by coming together with what we call rules of the road. Governments will always spy on each other; that’s been going on from the very beginning of time. For that, you want rules for acceptable, legal intercept, which has to be done by court order. But in terms of corporate espionage, we need conduct that people can count on.
Was Apple right to refuse the FBI’s demand to unlock the San Bernardino gunman’s iPhone?
Once you put in backdoors, once you allow a government to intercept anything they want, you have to give it to other governments around the world. Once you do that, there is no privacy, there is no security, there is no protection for democracy. So be very careful what you wish for: you might get it. And that’s why I think Tim Cook was courageous to say “There’s got to be a better way,” because doing carte blanche was not going to be acceptable.
You’re still an active chairman, but when you look back on your tenure as CEO, what was your biggest success?
The people and the culture we built at Cisco. At Cisco we are able reinvent ourselves every three to five years. We can do innovation at a speed that our peers over time have not kept up with, and that’s why we have no competitors from 15 years ago. We encourage a healthy paranoia.
How much risk is acceptable in managing market transitions?
The penalty for missing them is much more than the risk of going after them aggressively.
Between Trump and Clinton, who has the better technology policies?
If you’re asking, “How do you give middle-class America a pay raise? How do you create opportunities? How do you make the country more competitive on a global basis in a way that allows everybody to benefit? How do you change health care and education?”—well, those questions are all about a digital agenda, and yet I’ve not heard a single candidate articulate a vision on that.

John T. Chambers, in full John Thomas Chambers  (born  August 23, 1949, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), American business executive who, as CEO (1995–2015) of Cisco Systems, Inc., elevated the technology company into one of the largest corporations in the world in the early 21st century.Chambers grew up in Charleston, West Virginia, and attended West Virginia University, from which he received a bachelor’s degree in business (1971) and a law degree (1974). He subsequently earned an M.B.A. in finance and management (1975) from Indiana University at Bloomington. Chambers began his business career at IBM Corp. in 1976, and after six years there he moved to Wang Computers. During his eight-year tenure at Wang, he had to lay off 5,000 employees, and he later said, “I’ll do anything to avoid that again.” In 1991 Chambers took a position at Cisco as senior vice president of worldwide operations.From the moment he joined Cisco, Chambers made it clear that he did not intend to let the company rest on its laurels as the world’s chief provider of routers, the powerful network computers that sort the information packets that speed data through the Internet. Although the firm continued to improve the speed and capacity of the routers so that they could process one billion bits of information per second, Chambers had loftier goals. He presciently viewed the future as a time when “data, voice, and video will be delivered over a single connection in our homes.” With that in mind, he engineered the acquisition of more than 60 companies, aiming to broaden Cisco’s expertise and range of products. In his first five years as CEO, Cisco experienced a more than 10-fold increase in annual revenues. By 2000 the company was the third largest in the world. Although growth slowed considerably over the next several years, under Chambers’s leadership Cisco remained among the largest companies worldwide. Chambers stepped down as CEO in 2015, but he continued with the company as executive chairman.David Calhoun
