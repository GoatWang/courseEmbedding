 Educational Background



 


Norwich University

                  NORWICH'S MISSION IS TO GIVE OUR YOUTH AN EDUCATION THAT SHALL BE AMERICAN IN ITS CHARACTER.                




 


U.S. Army War College

                  The US Army War College educates and develops leaders for service at the strategic level while advancing knowledge in the global application of Landpower.
Root Hall Entrance
The purpose of US Army War College at this time in our Nation's history is to produce graduates from all our courses who are skilled critical thinkers and complex problem solvers in the global application of Landpower. Concurrently, it is our duty to the Army to also act as a "Think Factory" for Commanders and Civilian Leaders at the strategic level worldwide and routinely engage in discourse and debate on ground forces' role in achieving national security objectives. We will accomplish this dual purpose along the following lines of effort:

    Provide high quality Professional Military Education at the strategic level that further develops accomplished officers and civilians, both graduates and faculty, who depart our institution armed with the right balance of theory, history, practice, and communication skills to clearly articulate options for solutions to complex strategic problems and immediately be of value to any organization.
    Aggressively Conduct Research, Publish, Engage in Discourse, and Wargame with the entire faculty, staff, students and fellows; generate ideas and test concepts as the Army's intellectual broken field runner for the application of Landpower at the strategic level.
    Conduct Strategic Leader Development through agile, constantly reviewed and updated courses of instruction and other products that advance strategic leadership skills and senior leader abilities in the Profession of Arms.
    Attract, Recruit, and Retain a high quality faculty and staff.
