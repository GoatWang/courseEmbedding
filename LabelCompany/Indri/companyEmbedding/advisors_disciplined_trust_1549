Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Factoid of the Day


Tuesday, July 25, 2017






The Weather Company announced yesterday that it expects a total of 15 named storms and eight hurricanes (three will be major in scope) in the Atlantic this hurricane season. The 2017 season began on June 1. Its forecast matches the average amount of activity posted from 1995 through 2016 (15 named storms and eight hurricanes/three major in scope). Since 1980, there have been 32 hurricanes in the U.S. that produced damages in excess of $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and Bloomberg. The combined losses, adjusted for inflation, totaled $549.9 billion, with Katrina (2005) accounting for $156.3 billion of it.

Why You Still Can’t Trust Your Financial Advisor 


 


Liz Weston 

June 13, 2016




















SavedSave 



Investing, IRA, Retirement Income, Retirement Planning





If you haven’t already, expect to hear from your financial advisor soon about a great new investment opportunity for your IRA.
The reason: There’s a loophole in a strict new rule that requires advisors to act in their clients’ best interests when counseling them about retirement funds. That loophole allows advisors to continue lining their pockets at the expense of yours until the federal rule takes effect April 10, 2017, and even beyond.
“There’s a grandfather clause,” explains Barbara Roper, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. “People need to be watching out for advisors who are trying to earn last-minute excess profits before the rule goes into effect.”
Not all advisors are out to get you, of course. But enough of them are taking advantage of small investors that the Department of Labor finally has called foul.
The department’s so-called “fiduciary rule” holds advisors to a much higher standard when their advice pertains to a workplace retirement plan or an IRA. The rule doesn’t prohibit advisors from earning commissions on their investment recommendations, but it does require them to disclose their conflicts of interest and charge “only reasonable compensation” while forbidding financial incentives that encourage advisors to act contrary to their clients’ best interests. Clients will have to sign this “best interests contract exemption” and can sue their advisors in court if they believe their interests haven’t been properly served.
The fallout will be huge
Among the many consequences, expect that:
Annuity sales will drop. It’s going to become a lot harder for an advisor to justify recommending high-cost, high-commission products such as variable annuities and indexed annuities for your retirement plan. The primary advantage of annuities is tax deferral, and you’ve already got that in your IRA and 401(k). It’s pretty clear who’s benefiting from these recommendations — and it’s not you.
Rollovers will be trickier. Advisors are often eager to get their hands on 401(k) money and they promote rollovers into IRAs as a way to get at it. Once the new rule is in effect, advisors will have to explain why you’re better off in a higher-cost retail IRA than you were in your lower-cost, institutional 401(k).
“Incentives” are on the endangered species list.  Annuity providers have long proffered bonuses, prizes and other inducements, including trips to luxury resorts on tropical islands, something known as “incentive travel,” to advisors who push their products. The effect of the Labor rule is expected to be so significant that two industry groups, the Financial & Insurance Conference Planners and the Society for Incentive Travel Excellence, issued a joint statement warning meeting planners to brace for its impact.
You’re not out of the woods
Elimination of these obvious conflicts of interest is good, but there still are many substantial threats to your financial well-being. Among them:
The rule doesn’t apply to nonretirement accounts. Your advisor can continue to sell you expensive or poorly performing investments for your brokerage account or your kids’ college funds even though better, cheaper ones are available — just because the advisor gets paid more to push the inferior versions. Advisors get away with this on nonretirement accounts because instead of being held to a fiduciary standard, they’re covered by the much lower “suitability standard,” which only requires the advisor to “have a reasonable basis for believing the recommendation is suitable for you,” according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Wall Street is still fighting the new rule. The U.S. House of Representatives voted in April to block the rule, but Republicans failed to gain enough support to override a sure presidential veto. Now, financial industry groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have filed a lawsuit challenging the fiduciary standard. The Department of Labor says it’s confident the rule can withstand any legal challenges, but it’s possible the battle could delay implementation.
Financial firms still will try to justify the unjustifiable. Some companies will seek ways around the rule so they can continue to push “high-commission garbage” on their unsuspecting customers, says Bob Veres, publisher of the financial planning trade publication Inside Information. Investor lawsuits eventually will bring that behavior to a halt, since “the whole enforcement mechanism is the court system,” Veres says.
“One of the things that scares the brokerage firms and independent broker-dealers is the fact that they aren’t going to be dealing with regulators, who they can slyly promise a nice, lucrative post-DOL employment career if they ‘play ball,’” Veres says.
Even with the new rule in place, your advisor could be a skunk. The suitability standard isn’t that hard to meet, and yet many advisors couldn’t even manage that. More than 7% of advisors overall and up to 20% at some big firms have been disciplined for misconduct or fraud, according to a working paper by researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of Minnesota who studied 10 years of records from BrokerCheck, a financial advisor database. The advisors were disciplined for unsuitable investments, unauthorized activity, omission of key facts, fraud, negligence, misrepresentations and excessive trading.
The researchers allege that some firms “specialize in misconduct” by tolerating bad behavior and hiring advisors with spotty records. Most of those disciplined either kept their jobs or promptly were hired by another firm.
How to find a good advisor
You might conclude, as many others have, that you’re better off avoiding financial advisors entirely. You’re not.
The best advisors can save you time and money, protect you from threats to your wealth and get you to your goals a lot faster. A really good financial planner is especially important in the five years before and after retirement, when you’ll be making a lot of decisions that can’t be reversed. These choices can spell the difference between a comfortable retirement and running out of assets before you run out of breath.
So how do you make sure you have one of the good ones? These tests can help:
Your advisor has earned a CFP or a PFS credential. Certified Financial Planners and CPA-Personal Financial Specialists have to take comprehensive financial planning coursework, pass a rigorous test and agree to certain ethical standards, including acting as a fiduciary when advising you about financial planning. Advisors without comprehensive financial planning credentials don’t know what they don’t know, which makes them a potential menace to your financial life. (You can check credentials with the CFP Board of Standards, the AICPA or CPAVerify.)
Your advisor will sign the fiduciary oath. This plain-English promise, created by a group of financial planners promoting the standard, spells out that your advisor is committed to putting your best interests ahead of his own. It’s simple, it’s straightforward and if he balks, you’ve learned all you need to know about whose side he’s on.
You’ve done a background check. You don’t get to skate on doing your due diligence. Not all bad actors have a checkered history — witness former investment advisor and fraudster Bernie Madoff — but there’s no excuse for hiring someone who’s already screwed over previous customers, however charming or highly recommended he or she may be. There are too many other good, honest advisors out there to entrust your savings to someone with a history of misconduct.
Your advisor’s not human. The Department of Labor pointed to robo-advisors as a low-cost source of fiduciary advice for small investors — and for good reason. Robo-advisors such as Betterment and Wealthfront use computer algorithms and dirt-cheap exchange-traded funds to manage your investments for a fraction of what a human advisor would cost. The services typically cost between 0.3% and 0.5% of the amount you invest, a charge that includes the expense ratios of the underlying funds. Contrast that with human advisors who may charge 1%, on top of the 1% or more cost of the underlying investments.
Some robo-advisors take a cyborg approach, combining computerized portfolios with phone and email access to a human advisor. Even when a human is involved, though, the services are committed to a fiduciary standard of care to put your best interests first.
Not all robo-advisors are conflict-free. Some, including Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Blackrock’s FutureAdvisor, use proprietary products that could run afoul of the new Department of Labor rules, says financial planner Michael Kitces, who blogs at Nerd’s Eye View.
Still, we’re typically talking about fee differentials measured in tenths or even hundredths of a percent. That’s a far cry from the 5% commissions and 20% surrender charges that plague investments sold by nonfiduciary advisors.
And no one will ever offer a trip to a luxury resort to a computer as an incentive to tilt the portfolio their way.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Powers granted to an acting Trustee of this Living Trust include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Trustee will have the same rights and obligations to manage the Property as if the Trustee were the owner of the Property.

The Trustee may lend funds to any borrower where the loan is adequately secured by sufficient collateral and where the loan is reasonable and in the best overall interest of this Living Trust.

The Trustee may make the Final Distribution in any combination of cash and property. Property selection and valuation in the course of the Final Distribution will be made in the good faith discretion of the Trustee and will be binding on all Beneficiaries.

All decisions of the acting Trustee, made in good faith, regarding the management of this Living Trust will be final and binding on all parties.

Homestead Tax Exemption

If the principal residence of the Grantor is held within this Revocable Living Trust, the Grantor maintains the right to possess and inhabit the residence without rent and charge-free, for the duration of their lifetime. This is intended for the purpose of giving the Grantor a beneficial interest and possessor rights in the residence and to ensure that the Grantor does not lose any eligibility for a state homestead tax exemption that they would otherwise qualify for. 

Vote of Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiaries

Where a Beneficiary is a Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary and a vote, consent, or decision of the Qualified Beneficiaries is required, then the parent, custodian or guardian for that Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary, acting in the best interest of that Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary, will be allowed to take the place of that Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary for the purpose of that vote, consent, or decision.

Termination of Trust

This Living Trust will terminate where the Property of this Living Trust is exhausted through distributions.

In the event that the acting Trustee concludes that the value of the Property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration and that the aggregate value of the Property is less than $50,000.00 (USD), the acting Trustee may terminate this Living Trust after providing notice to the Qualified Beneficiaries. Where this Living Trust is terminated under this section, the acting Trustee will distribute the Property in a manner consistent with and as described in the distributions sections of this Living Trust.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Where there are no other resources available, and where the Trustee is compelled to do so, the Trustee may resolve any legally enforceable debts, taxes, reasonable funeral expenses, burial expenses and any expenses related to the final illness of the Grantor out of the resources of this Living Trust.

The Trustee may make the Final Distribution in any combination of cash and property. Property selection and valuation in the course of the Final Distribution will be made in the good faith discretion of the Trustee and will be binding on all Beneficiaries.



It is incumbent on the Trustee to act as fiduciaries, in good faith and in the best interest of the Living Trust.

All decisions of the acting Trustee, made in good faith, regarding the management of this Living Trust will be final and binding on all parties.

The above authority and powers granted to the Trustee are in addition to any powers and elective rights conferred by state or federal law or by other provision of this Living Trust and may be exercised as often as required, and without application to or approval by any court.

In the event that the acting Trustee concludes that the value of the Property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration and that the aggregate value of the Property is less than $50,000.00 (USD), the acting Trustee may terminate this Living Trust after providing notice to the Qualified Beneficiaries. Where this Living Trust is terminated under this section, the acting Trustee will distribute the Property in a manner consistent with and as described in the distributions sections of this Living Trust.

Abstract of Trust

The acting Trustee may execute an abstract of this Living Trust (the "Abstract of Trust") and may present the Abstract of Trust to a financial institution as proof of the existence of this Living Trust.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

Trust Purpose

The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust.

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.
