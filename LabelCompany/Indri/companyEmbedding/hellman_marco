Early life and education[edit]
Hellman was born to a Jewish family[3][4] in New York and spent his early childhood in Manhattan,[5] the son of Ruth (née Koshland)[6] and Marco "Mick" Hellman.[5] During World War II, his family moved to Vacaville, California where his father served as a Major in the Army and his mother worked as a Women Airforce Service Pilot, flying military planes from aircraft factories to bases.[5] After the war, they moved to San Francisco where he graduated from Lowell High School. In 1955, he graduated from University of California, Berkeley and in 1959, he graduated with an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.[5]
Career[edit]
After school, he worked in investment banking at Lehman Brothers becoming a partner at age 26, the youngest in the firm's history.[6] In 1973, he was named president and head of investment banking.[6] and also head of the Investment Banking Division and Chairman of Lehman Corporation. In 1977, he moved to Boston and co-founded with Paul J. Ferri a venture capital firm, Hellman, Ferri Investment Associates (later renamed Matrix Partners), an early-stage investor in SanDisk and Apple.[5] In 1984, he moved back to San Francisco and co-founded the buyout firm, Hellman & Friedman with Tully Friedman where he served as chairman of the firm as well as a member of the Firm's Investment and Compensation Committees.
Hellman & Friedman's strategy was to buy companies heavy on intellectual acumen (typically financial services or software companies) and light on physical assets (such as manufacturers) with strong cash flows that need operational improvements.[5] In 1995, the firm purchased Levi Strauss & Co. from 250 family shareholders and consolidated it among four men including Hellman and then-CEO Robert D. Haas.[5] The company reduced its debt and improved its earnings.
Family history[edit]
Though his fortune was largely self-made, Hellman was the great-grandson of Isaias W. Hellman, a prominent early California banker (President of Wells Fargo Bank), philanthropist, and a founding father of the University of Southern California.[7] Isaias Hellman's sister-in-law was married to Mayer Lehman, one of the founders of Lehman Brothers. Warren Hellman's mother, the former Ruth Koshland, was the granddaughter of Jesse Koshland, a pioneer wool merchant of San Francisco (a nephew of Jesse Koshland, Daniel E. Koshland, Sr., served as the CEO of Levi Strauss & Co).
The Hellman family is not connected to the Hellmann’s mayonnaise company.[8]
Hellman was married to Patricia Christina "Chris" Sander;[4] they had four children: Marco "Mick" Hellman; Frances Hellman; Judith Hellman; and Patricia Hellman Gibbs. His daughter, Frances Hellman, is the Dean of the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at UC Berkeley.[9] His funeral was held at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Hellman was born to a Jewish family[3][4] in New York and spent his early childhood in Manhattan,[5] the son of Ruth (née Koshland)[6] and Marco "Mick" Hellman.[5] During World War II, his family moved to Vacaville, California where his father served as a Major in the Army and his mother worked as a Women Airforce Service Pilot, flying military planes from aircraft factories to bases.[5] After the war, they moved to San Francisco where he graduated from Lowell High School. In 1955, he graduated from University of California, Berkeley and in 1959, he graduated with an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.[5]
Career[edit]
After school, he worked in investment banking at Lehman Brothers becoming a partner at age 26, the youngest in the firm's history.[6] In 1973, he was named president and head of investment banking.[6] and also head of the Investment Banking Division and Chairman of Lehman Corporation. In 1977, he moved to Boston and co-founded with Paul J. Ferri a venture capital firm, Hellman, Ferri Investment Associates (later renamed Matrix Partners), an early-stage investor in SanDisk and Apple.[5] In 1984, he moved back to San Francisco and co-founded the buyout firm, Hellman & Friedman with Tully Friedman where he served as chairman of the firm as well as a member of the Firm's Investment and Compensation Committees.
Hellman & Friedman's strategy was to buy companies heavy on intellectual acumen (typically financial services or software companies) and light on physical assets (such as manufacturers) with strong cash flows that need operational improvements.[5] In 1995, the firm purchased Levi Strauss & Co. from 250 family shareholders and consolidated it among four men including Hellman and then-CEO Robert D. Haas.[5] The company reduced its debt and improved its earnings.
Family history[edit]
Though his fortune was largely self-made, Hellman was the great-grandson of Isaias W. Hellman, a prominent early California banker (President of Wells Fargo Bank), philanthropist, and a founding father of the University of Southern California.[7] Isaias Hellman's sister-in-law was married to Mayer Lehman, one of the founders of Lehman Brothers. Warren Hellman's mother, the former Ruth Koshland, was the granddaughter of Jesse Koshland, a pioneer wool merchant of San Francisco (a nephew of Jesse Koshland, Daniel E. Koshland, Sr., served as the CEO of Levi Strauss & Co).
The Hellman family is not connected to the Hellmann’s mayonnaise company.[8]
Hellman was married to Patricia Christina "Chris" Sander;[4] they had four children: Marco "Mick" Hellman; Frances Hellman; Judith Hellman; and Patricia Hellman Gibbs. His daughter, Frances Hellman, is the Dean of the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at UC Berkeley.[9] His funeral was held at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Hellman was born to a Jewish family[3][4] in New York and spent his early childhood in Manhattan,[5] the son of Ruth (née Koshland)[6] and Marco "Mick" Hellman.[5] During World War II, his family moved to Vacaville, California where his father served as a Major in the Army and his mother worked as a Women Airforce Service Pilot, flying military planes from aircraft factories to bases.[5] After the war, they moved to San Francisco where he graduated from Lowell High School. In 1955, he graduated from University of California, Berkeley and in 1959, he graduated with an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.[5]
Career[edit]
After school, he worked in investment banking at Lehman Brothers becoming a partner at age 26, the youngest in the firm's history.[6] In 1973, he was named president and head of investment banking.[6] and also head of the Investment Banking Division and Chairman of Lehman Corporation. In 1977, he moved to Boston and co-founded with Paul J. Ferri a venture capital firm, Hellman, Ferri Investment Associates (later renamed Matrix Partners), an early-stage investor in SanDisk and Apple.[5] In 1984, he moved back to San Francisco and co-founded the buyout firm, Hellman & Friedman with Tully Friedman where he served as chairman of the firm as well as a member of the Firm's Investment and Compensation Committees.
Hellman & Friedman's strategy was to buy companies heavy on intellectual acumen (typically financial services or software companies) and light on physical assets (such as manufacturers) with strong cash flows that need operational improvements.[5] In 1995, the firm purchased Levi Strauss & Co. from 250 family shareholders and consolidated it among four men including Hellman and then-CEO Robert D. Haas.[5] The company reduced its debt and improved its earnings.
Family history[edit]
Though his fortune was largely self-made, Hellman was the great-grandson of Isaias W. Hellman, a prominent early California banker (President of Wells Fargo Bank), philanthropist, and a founding father of the University of Southern California.[7] Isaias Hellman's sister-in-law was married to Mayer Lehman, one of the founders of Lehman Brothers. Warren Hellman's mother, the former Ruth Koshland, was the granddaughter of Jesse Koshland, a pioneer wool merchant of San Francisco (a nephew of Jesse Koshland, Daniel E. Koshland, Sr., served as the CEO of Levi Strauss & Co).
The Hellman family is not connected to the Hellmann’s mayonnaise company.[8]
Hellman was married to Patricia Christina "Chris" Sander;[4] they had four children: Marco "Mick" Hellman; Frances Hellman; Judith Hellman; and Patricia Hellman Gibbs. His daughter, Frances Hellman, is the Dean of the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at UC Berkeley.[9] His funeral was held at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco.[10]

At Hellmann’s, we’re about bringing out the best in real, pleasurable moments. And food is a big part of life (a fact that pleases us). So for us, every meal should be relished not rushed. We believe in real food, made with real simple ingredients.

So we’re standing up for wonderful, magical, tasty, flavourful, happy, joyful, naughty, heart-warming, belly-filling, life-affirming, proper, lovely, amazing, familiar, exotic, fast, slow, delicious, good food.Let’s defend food from those who would exploit it. Let’s put taste back on its pedestal and protect it from blandness. Let’s make good food available to all, and make sure it doesn’t cost the earth. And let’s have a proper, honest, grown-up conversation about what ‘good food’ really means.Because at Hellmann’s, we’re on the side of food.
Good from farm to fork
Any great cook will tell you that great taste starts with great ingredients. And we’ve always found that the best ingredients come from a good place.Richard Hellmann thought so, too. Which is why, when he created that very first jar of blue-ribbon mayonnaise in 1913, he used the best ingredients he could get his hands on.For a long, long time, we’ve been committed to sustainable farming and doing right by the people who help us make Hellmann’s. Not just because we think it makes our products better, but also because it’s the right thing to do.It’s why we only use 100% free-range eggs and source 100% of our oils responsibly in our mayonnaise.Because we’re on the side of food.

Warren Hellman, a Wall Street investor who was president of Lehman Brothers and whose passion for bluegrass inspired him to create a San Francisco music festival that draws hundreds of thousands of people a year, died on Sunday in San Francisco. He was 77.The cause was complications of leukemia, according to a spokeswoman for Hellman & Freidman, the investment firm he co-founded.Mr. Hellman, whose parents came from two prominent San Francisco families, had a finance career on both coasts. After nearly 20 years at Lehman in New York, he started several money management businesses, including Hellman & Friedman in San Francisco, one of the country’s most successful private equity funds.More recently Mr. Hellman focused on philanthropy, bestowing millions of dollars on cultural, educational and medical charities in the Bay Area.

Wiry, impish and informal — he favored frayed khakis and cowboy shirts — Mr. Hellman was something of a free spirit. He traveled around the country with his bluegrass band, the Wronglers, performing with them as recently as October. An accomplished endurance athlete, he twice completed a 100-mile running race through the Sierra Nevada mountains.“Warren was an individualist,” said James D. Wolfensohn, the former president of the World Bank and a business-school classmate of Mr. Hellman’s. “He had the confidence and access that comes along with being from a prominent family, but never rested on his laurels and lived the life he wanted.”Frederick Warren Hellman was born on July 25, 1934, in Manhattan. He was not, as many assumed, an heir to the Hellmann’s mayonnaise fortune; his pedigree was in the finance and rag trades. His father was Marco F. Hellman, an investment banker. His mother was the former Ruth Koshland, whose relatives were prosperous wool merchants in California.His great-grandfather, Isaias W. Hellman, was a Jewish immigrant from Bavaria who became one of California’s leading financiers and served as president of Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank, which later became Wells Fargo.Mr. Hellman grew up in San Francisco and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, where he played varsity water polo. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1959, he joined Lehman Brothers, where his uncle, Frederick L. Ehrman, was a senior executive and later chairman.

An aggressive dealmaker at Lehman, Mr. Hellman earned the nickname Hurricane Hellman. At 26, he became the youngest partner in the firm’s history, and in 1973, at 39, president. The firm’s partners ousted Mr. Ehrman that year, and Mr. Hellman had to deliver the news to his uncle.In Ken Auletta’s 1985 book, “Greed and Glory on Wall Street: The Fall of the House of Lehman,” Mr. Hellman is quoted as saying that he couldn’t recall the expression on Mr. Ehrman’s face because he had stared at his uncle’s feet for the entire conversation. (He clearly remembered that Mr. Ehrman’s socks were gray and bunched around his ankles, however.)

After leaving Lehman in 1977, Mr. Hellman moved to Boston, where he helped start two investment firms: Hellman, Jordan, a manager of stock portfolios; and a venture capital fund that invested in start-up technology companies. That fund, now called Matrix Partners, was an early backer of Apple Computer.

After moving back to San Francisco, Mr. Hellman and Tully Friedman, an investment banker at Salomon Brothers, started Hellman & Friedman in 1984. He said he had set out to build a firm that did the exact opposite of Lehman, which he described as nasty and corrosive.With Hellman & Friedman he orchestrated its buyout of Levi Strauss as well as its investments in the Nasdaq and the advertising company Young & Rubicam. Today the firm’s holdings include the media companies Getty Images and Nielsen.Until recently Mr. Hellman arose daily at 4:30 a.m. for a 16-mile run through the Presidio before heading into the office. He was a five-time age group national champion in ride and tie, a combination of cross-country running and horseback riding. In the 1970s he co-founded the Stratton Mountain School in Vermont for competitive junior skiers and later served as president of the United States ski team.He gradually turned over the management of Hellman & Friedman to his partners and concentrated on civic pursuits, among them the construction of an underground parking garage in Golden Gate Park and providing the financial backing for The Bay Citizen, a nonprofit local news organization that provides content to The New York Times.Banjo picking and bluegrass were his longtime loves, and in 2001 he hosted a one-day free concert featuring Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss. Hardly Strictly Bluegrass is now a three-day event that draws more than 750,000 people a year, its organizers say. And it offers more than bluegrass; the rock stars Elvis Costello, Patti Smith and John Mellencamp have been among the performers. It has also featured the Wronglers, Mr. Hellman’s band, which released an album this year, “Heirloom Music,” with Jimmie Dale Gilmore.Last week, city officials renamed Speedway Meadow, the site of the festival, Hellman’s Hollow.Mr. Hellman’s wife of 56 years, Chris, survives him, as do four children, Mick, Tricia Gibbs, Frances Hellman and Judith Hellman; 12 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.In 2009, Mr. Hellman and his daughter Tricia, a doctor, celebrated a joint bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies typically for 13-year-olds. Though he began studying the Torah in the 1980s, Mr. Hellman grew up secular, and neither he nor his children or grandchildren had had a bar mitzvah.Mr. Hellman told a local Jewish weekly newspaper that the ritual — during which he wore a yarmulke bearing a “Cal” logo, an homage to his alma mater — had connected him to his past.“After 75 years, I have come home,” he said.

 Correction: December 21, 2011  
An obituary on Tuesday about Warren Hellman, the Wall Street investor and patron of bluegrass music, misspelled the name of the mayonnaise company that some mistakenly assumed his family founded. It is Hellmann’s, not Hellman’s.
