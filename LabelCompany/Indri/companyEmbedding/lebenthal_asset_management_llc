Lebenthal, CEO of Lebenthal Asset Management. “Griffin has achieved its success by delivering competitive returns to its clients through some of the most challenging markets in history. We are committed to making this business combination mutually beneficial for everyone involved, particularly the Griffin clients, as we continue to expand Lebenthal’s footprint in wealth and asset management. I believe that Doug and his team will play a meaningful role in extending the strong brand legacy and growth potential of Lebenthal.” 





Doug Famigletti started his investment career in 1996 with Massachusetts Financial Services. He then joined Griffin Asset Management LLC where he spent four years as an equity research analyst. In 2000 Mr. Famigletti joined Goldman Sachs’ Institutional Sales Desk and was responsible for providing sales coverage for some of their largest clients. Mr. Famigletti returned to Griffin Asset Management LLC in 2004. Mr. Famigletti is a Chartered Financial Analyst, a member of the CFA Institute and the New York Society of Security Analysts. He earned a B.A. in Economics from Hamilton College.
Tom Famigletti entered the investment business in the 1960’s, starting his career in the Trust Department of First National City Bank (now Citigroup) as an analyst and Investment Officer managing trust assets. Mr. Famigletti then joined European American Bank in 1972 where he started the investment management division. After ten years of managing institutional and private client assets at EAB, he joined Dreman Value Management, and as one of three original partners at Dreman he helped grow the assets under management from under $50 million to over $4 billion. Mr. Famigletti earned a B.A. in Economics from Hofstra University and is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts, and the Financial Analysts Federation.

Doug Famigletti commented on the transaction: “We are excited to be joining the team at Lebenthal. At Griffin, our primary focus for all of our clients—individuals and institutions—has always been to partner with them for the long term, a value which is abundantly shared by the culture and tradition of Lebenthal. Not only will this be a good fit for our clients and our management team, I believe that the platform, infrastructure and brand strength of Lebenthal will help our business grow.”

                Alexandra Lebenthal to retain majority stake in broker-dealer
            



                Former Barclays CEO Diamond is among South Street investors
            



Lebenthal Holdings LLC agreed to sell its asset-management business and woman-owned broker dealer to South Street Securities Holdings Inc., the brokerage whose investors include former Barclays Plc Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond.South Street purchased a 49 percent ownership interest in Lebenthal & Co., led by CEO Alexandra Lebenthal, and a 100 percent stake in Lebenthal Asset Management, run by her brother James, according to a statement Tuesday from Pi Capital International LLC, which was South Street’s investment bank for the transaction. Terms of the deal, which also include the Lebenthal Family Office, weren’t disclosed.Alexandra Lebenthal will retain her 51 percent stake in Lebenthal & Co. after the transaction is completed, enabling the firm to keep its woman-owned status. Lebenthal has struggled to keep her business afloat in recent years, having opened and shuttered a municipal-bond operation as underwriting opportunities dwindled and the amount of municipal debt dropped to a multi-year low. In August, she also closed a 3-year-old wealth-advisory unit that never gained traction.








Alexandra and James “held the businesses together” under difficult circumstances in recent years, Jim Tabacchi, South Street’s CEO, said in a telephone interview. “They deserve some kudos for that and I’m looking forward to helping them shift gears” and expand their businesses, he said.Read more: Jimmy Cayne’s loan to LebenthalLebenthal was founded in 1925 by Alexandra’s grandparents, Louis and Sayra, as an odd-lot clearinghouse. Her father James joined the family business in 1967, and began a series of television ads with taglines like “bonds are my babies” as he tried to popularize municipal bonds for investors.




James retired as president in 1995, handing the reins to Alexandra, who was 31 at the time. Six years later, she sold the business to insurer Mony Group Inc.’s Advest subsidiary for $25 million. Merrill Lynch & Co. bought Advest in 2005, retiring the Lebenthal name. In 2007, Alexandra reached a deal to get the family name back from Merrill and revived her family’s business as Lebenthal Holdings. “It’s just another chapter in 91 years of a name that’s still here -- and that, at the end of the day, is something I’m really proud of,” Alexandra Lebenthal said in a telephone interview.

Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital invested in South Street in June 2015. He said in October of that year that he sees an “incredible entrepreneurial opportunity” to invest in financial companies competing with so-called systemically important banks that are facing increasing scrutiny from regulators. Tabacchi said Tuesday that Diamond has increased his holding to 35 percent since the original investment, making him the firm’s largest stakeholder.Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy was South Street’s legal counsel. Gordian Group served as investment banker to Lebenthal, and Saul Ewing was legal counsel.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
