There's a lot that you have to do each day. With an easy-to-use calendar, professionals can easily keep track of important dates, times and events. Browse 2016 calendars at Staples to find tools that help you stay on schedule.

Choose the Right Calendar Layout
While comparing planners and calendars, users can explore various layout options. Factors to consider when choosing a layout include planner size, the amount of detail on each page and your scheduling needs. Academic calendars typically run from August of one year to December of the following year, allowing students to start each school year with a fresh planner. Other planners generally start in January and include one year of spreads. 

Wall calendars with daily layouts make it easy to plan each day down to the hour, while those with weekly spreads permit users to look at the week ahead on one page. For on-the-go planning, many people prefer planners with monthly spreads. These thin, lightweight options are ideal for scheduling appointments and vacation plans. Monthly layouts are the most common option for calendars.

Calendars of Different Sizes Suit Various Needs
Calendars and planners come in a variety of sizes for each user's needs. Book-style planners and calendars are easy to transport and offer convenience to those who need constant access to their schedule. Binder planners are similar, but they have additional customizable features. Desk calendars lie flat on desks for reference and schedule changes during work hours. Wall calendars are designed to be hanged on the wall, freeing up desk space and making schedule information available to everyone in the room.

2017 Calendars Make It Easy to Plan Ahead
Any of the 2017 calendars you choose should help you plan ahead, keep track of various schedules and make full use of your day. For many professionals, combined use of wall calendars and portable planners is the solution.

Can You Choose Which Pages Are in a Calendar?
Users who like to customize their daily planners often prefer binder planners. This design permits professionals to choose the pages and spreads they want to include. Binder planners often feature options such as contact and address pages, daily schedule spreads, monthly spreads and to-do lists.

Are Academic Calendars Different from Standard Calendars?
Academic planners have some key differences that set them apart from other personal organization tools. In addition to starting at the beginning of the school year, rather than January, they usually have pages for class schedules and teacher contact information. Some academic calendars have spots to note exam dates and homework due dates.

Which Calendars Are Optimal for Business Use?
Since business needs vary, users should compare multiple monthly calendars to find one that fits their style. Those who have frequent meetings, appointments and deadlines benefit from planners with daily scheduling pages. These pages let professionals plan out each hour of the day without running out of space.

Make it to every meeting on time with calendars and planners. Use planners to keep track of personal, professional and medical appointments and feel confident about what each day will bring.

Staples also offers a collection of free printable 2017 calendars for your office or home needs.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in NY, I'd be happy to help.Learn More 5 Tips for Insurance Shopping OnlineThe choices you make when selecting insurance coverages, limits and deductibles can affect what you'll pay for a policy. Learn about what to expect when you're shopping for car insurance online.Learn More Vacation Home CoverageWhether you're looking for that perfect spot on the beach, want a kitchen to use or need somewhere with room for extended family, sometimes a vacation rental is the best fit for your getaway. And while you probably thought about the cost, you may not have thought about the insurance implications of staying in a rental. Are you covered if your suitcases are stolen during your stay? What happens if the home is damaged while you're there? Before you start packing, make sure you'll be covered while you're away.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater. Start here for some helpful information on selecting or changing your beneficiary.Learn More Tips for Managing Small Business Insurance CostsBeing a small business owner can mean working long after you've "closed" for the day. The to-do list is never done, and you're frequently juggling priorities. But you may want to move reviewing your business insurance to the top of that list. There's a lot to consider when covering the business you put your heart into. From making sure you having the right amount of protection to managing risks and bundling coverages, I'm here to help you choose the coverage that is right for your business.Learn More Insurance That Protects Your BikeYour motorcycle is more than just a way to get around. You've invested your time in it, you've made sure it's in perfect working order and you took classes and bought the right gear so you could enjoy it safely. It only make sense that you put the same effort into safeguarding your bike, and you, with insurance. Whether it's collision coverage or a custom paint job, it's important to make sure you have the protection that fits your bike. Here's a breakdown of coverages to help you decide what is right for you.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Water Damage In Your CondoOne of the great perks to living in a condo is that it's fairly low-maintenance. You likely don't have to worry about lawn care or replacing the roof. But what about water damage? Whether your washer overflows or a bathroom pipe bursts, water damage can wreak havoc. If you have condo insurance, though, you'll generally have coverage for accidental damage caused by your plumbing or appliances. While I hope your home stays dry and cozy, it's a good idea to know what your condo policy may cover just in case.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Washingtonville.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(845) 497-3633(845) 497-3633Fax(845) 497-3655(845) 497-3655Email:lindalang@allstate.comlindalang@allstate.comAddress:19 Goshen AveWashingtonville, NY 10992Get DirectionsLandmarks:I am at 19 Goshen Avenue which is in the center of Washingtonville at the intersection of Route 94 and Route 208.
