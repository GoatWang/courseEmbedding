(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations  For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014  The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014. For detailed financial information, see the financial statements included in this annual report.  Balance Sheet Data: 6/30/2015 6/30/2014 Cash $ 1,195 $ 574 Total assets $ 1,370 $ 749 Total liabilities $ 566 $ 12,499 Shareholders' equity (deficit) $ 804 $ (11,750 )  The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included herein. Our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:   Years Ended June 30 2015 2014 Revenue $ 0 $ 0 Operating Expenses 34,208 1,939 Net Loss $ (34,208 ) $ (2,108 )  Revenues  We have not earned any revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014. We are presently in the development stage of our business and we can provide no assurance that we begin earning revenues.  Expenses Our expenses for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 are outlined in the table below: Years Ended June 30 2015 2014 Audit Fees $ 12,800 - Professional Fees 20,700 1,795 Other 708 144 Total Expenses $ 34,208 $ 1,939  Professional Fees  The professional fees for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 were $20,700, and $1,795, respectively. Professional fees include our accounting expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of our financial statements, professional fees that we pay to our legal counsel and other professional fees. The increase in our audit fees and professional fees is associated with our developmental business activity.  Net Losses  Operating expenses were composed of professional fees and general and administrative expenses during the year ended June 30, 2015. The net loss for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 were $34,208, and $2,108, respectively. In addition to professional fees and general and administrative expenses we also incurred interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2014.  Going Concern  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no business operations and has recurring losses, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party. There is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future.  Plan of Operation  At this time, the Company's purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. The Company will not restrict its search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. This discussion of the proposed business is intentionally general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company's virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because the Company has nominal assets and limited financial resources. See "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to shareholders of the Company because it will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  The Company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. The Company may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. However, there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful.  The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, the officers and directors of the Company. Management intends to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities, which may be brought to its attention through present associations of the Company's officers and directors. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, management will consider such matters as the available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the Company; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition of acceptance of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. The Company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained prior to the closing of the proposed transaction.  It is anticipated that the Company will require approximately $50,000 during the next 12 months to implement its business plan described herein. The Company has limited capital with which to pay these anticipated expenses. It is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the Company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the Company. The Company has not identified any alternative sources and there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  There is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and have not generated revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in implementing our business plan, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services.  To become profitable and competitive, we must implement our business plan and generate revenue.  Summary of significant accounting policies:  This summary of significant accounting policies of Aladdin International, Inc. (the "Company") is presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.  (a) Organization and Description of Business  The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota on May 3, 1972. The Company was a franchisee of fast food restaurants in Milwaukee, Wisconsin until the franchised restaurants were sold in October 1998. After the sale, the Company has been engaged in searching for a merger candidate that would expand the Company's business plan.  The Company held a shareholder meeting on November 25, 2014 to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of the Company to eight hundred million (800,000,000) shares. The shares of common stock consist of 780,000,000 shares of common stock with full voting rights and a par value of $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The merger of the Minnesota company into the Nevada company was effective on December, 23, 2014 and the Articles of Merger were filed on December 30, 2014.  (b) Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  (c) Per Share Information  Earnings (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is not shown for periods in which the Company incurs a loss because it would be anti-dilutive.  (d) Basis of Presentation - Going Concern  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no business operations and has recurring losses, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party. There is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future.  Management has opted to commence filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and then to seek a business combination. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  (e) Recent Accounting Pronouncements  There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued during 2015 and 2014, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.  (f) Risks and Uncertainties  The Company is subject to substantial business risks and uncertainties inherent in starting a new business. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a business combination.  (g) Revenue Recognition  It is the Company's policy that revenue will be recognized in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." Under SAB 104, product revenues (or service revenues) are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or service has been performed), the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  (h) Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to consist of cash on hand and demand deposits in banks with an initial maturity of 90 days or less.  (i) Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC Subtopic 825-10 ("ASC 825-10"), "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments." ASC 825-10 requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments when it is practicable to estimate that value. The carrying amount of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, accounts payable, and advance from affiliates approximate their estimated fair values due to their short-term maturities.  (j) Income Taxes  The Company records deferred taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The statement requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements, the effect of net operating losses, based upon the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  (k) Concentrations  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the Company had no amounts of cash or cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by agencies of the U.S. Government.  (l) Reclassification  Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.  Sep 25, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2017




	(Unaudited)




	 




	(1)




	Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies






	Basis of Presentation





	The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements of Aladdin International, Inc. (the Company or Aladdin) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 and for the periods then ended have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys June 30, 2016 audited financial statements. The results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no business operations, has had recurring losses and has negative working capital and shareholders deficits, and due to the uncertainty of the Companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of its business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party.  There is no assurance that these advances will continue in the future.  The condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  





	The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed on October 13, 2016 (Annual Report).  Interim results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.





	(a)


	Related Party Debt






	Convertible Note






	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable which are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock. The Company accounts for convertible notes and debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options; ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity; ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity; EITF 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock; and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.





	The terms of such convertible notes payable are analyzed by management to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.





	The intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of related party convertible notes payable are included in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method. The Companys management also estimates the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of the Companys common stock as of the date of issuance.






	Non-convertible Note






	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable. The Company accounts for such notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470, Debt, and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

	On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Rewards Development (Billion Rewards), a British Virgin Island corporation whose beneficial owner is Mr. Shi Jianxiang, entered into a Loan Agreement (October Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the October Loan) to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2016 extended to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.






	 




	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.







	Certain statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, anticipate, estimate, plan, potential, project, continuing, ongoing, expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.







	The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.







	The "Company", "we," "us," and "our," refer to Aladdin International, Inc.







	Overview






	The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota on May 3, 1972. The Company was a franchisee of fast food restaurants in Milwaukee, Wisconsin until the franchised restaurants were sold in October 1998. The Company held a shareholder meeting on November 25, 2014 to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada through merging into Aladdin International, Inc. incorporated in Nevada and amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of the Company to eight hundred million (800,000,000) shares. The authorized shares of stock consist of 780,000,000 shares of common stock with full voting rights and a par value of $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The merger of the Minnesota Company into the Nevada Company was effective on December 23, 2014 and the Articles of Merger were filed on December 30, 2014.





	On July 20, 2015, Michael Friess and Sanford Schwartz (collectively, the "Shareholders"), majority shareholders of the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Billion Reward Development Limited (the "Purchaser"), a British Virgin Islands corporation, pursuant to which the Shareholders sold to the Purchaser an aggregate of 3,638,748 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company (the "Majority Interests") for $300,000 (the "Change in Control Transaction").





	In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on July 20, 2015, Michael Friess, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President and member of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company resigned from all of his officer positions with the Company except that his resignation as a member of the Board was not effective until the tenth day following the Company's mailing of the Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 to its shareholders as of the record date of July 20, 2015. Sanford Schwartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and member of the Board resigned from all of his positions with the Company. Also effective on July 20, 2015, Ningdi Chen was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Board.





	Since June 2010, the Company has had insignificant operations and assets consisting primarily of cash. As such, the Company is presently defined as a "shell" company under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). The Company has opted to become a "blank check" company and to further engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. At this time, the Company's purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. The Company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. The Company may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. However, there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful.

	The Company is planning to acquire a private company for a business combination and has had informal discussions with potential acquisition targets.  Previously disclosed informal discussions regarding a potential acquisition of a company in the business of creating and monetizing products based on licensed film and television intellectual property have ceased. No definitive documentation has been entered into in connection with any acquisition and there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully make any acquisition. If an acquisition occurs, the Company would likely issue a substantial number of additional shares of its common stock at a price which could be substantially below the current trading price of the Companys common stock. There may be no independent valuation done of any proposed target and there can be no assurance that the value of any proposed target would approximate the value of securities of the Company to be issued in connection with such acquisition.





	On October 1, 2015, Kai Ming Zhao accepted an offer prescribed in the offer letter ("Offer Letter") from the Company to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Zhao's total salary is $150,000 per year, with cash bonus based on performance. On October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation of Mr. Ningdi Chen as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Also on October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Kai Ming Zhao as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Kai Ming Zhao was also the principal accounting officer of the Company.





	On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Reward Development Limited ("Billion Reward"), our majority shareholder which owns 80% of total issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement ("October Loan Agreement"), whereby Billion Reward agrees to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the "October Loan") to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2017 extended to January 31, 2018 and bearing no interest. Under the October Loan Agreement, if the Company conducts an offering for a total amount of $2,000,000 (the "Offering") on or before February 28, 2017, the Loan will be automatically converted into shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Stock") of the Company at the conversion price equal to the purchase price in the Offering. Pursuant to the October Loan Agreement, Billion Reward will be entitled to convert any portion or all of the October Loan into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at the conversion price of volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg for twenty trading days prior to such conversion. On November 5, 2015, the Company received the October Loan in the amount of $200,000; the October Loan remains outstanding as of March 31, 2017.





	On January 7, 2016 the Company and Billion Reward entered into a loan agreement (January Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Reward agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $100,000 (the January Loan) to the Company with the maturity date of January 31, 2017 extended to January 31, 2017and bearing no interest. On January 12, 2017 the Company received the January Loan in the amount of $100,000.  





	On May 19, 2016 the Company and Billion Rewards entered into a loan agreement (June Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $43,840 (the June Loan) to the Company with the maturity date of April 30, 2017 extended to January 31, 2018 and bearing no interest. On June 9, 2016 the Company received the June Loan in the amount of $43,840.





	As of March 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit was ($634,411). Our stockholders' deficit as of March 31, 2017 was ($295,898). Our net income for the three months and net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 were $41,058 and ($53,034), respectively. Our losses have principally been attributed to a lack of revenues while incurring operating expenses.

	Operating expenses are comprised of audit, professional fees, payroll, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses decreased by $157,805 or 139.52%, from $113,105 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 to ($44,700) during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Also, operating expenses decreased by $173,541, or 80.53%, from $215,492 during the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $41,951 during the nine months ended March 31, 2017.  These decreases are primarily due to the rent refund, and elimination of payroll expenses associated with a new executive officer and assistant hired in fiscal 2016, and reduction of legal.


	 



	Net Income (Loss)






	The net income (loss) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $41,060, and ($119,700), respectively, and for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were ($53,033) and ($226,294), respectively. The changes in net income (loss) are primarily due to the changes in operating expenses as discussed above.

	Cash flows from operating activities were mainly comprised of the operating income and decrease in pre-paid expenses and security deposits offset by the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. These cash flows increased by $304,686, from ($290,714) for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $13,972 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to decreases in the operating loss of $173,261 or 76.6%, as discussed above, and prepaid expenses and deposits of $169,843, being partially offset by decreased accrued liabilities of $39,041, from $27,225 to ($11,816) for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The changes in prepaid expenses, deposits and accrued liabilities mainly resulted from refund of operating lease of office space and the security deposit (refer to Note 4).





	Financing cash flows decreased by $295,262, or 100%, from $295,262 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to none for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 (refer to Note 3).

	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.





	It is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the Company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the Company. It is anticipated that the Company will require approximately $200,000 during the next 12 months to implement its business plan. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has limited capital with which to pay anticipated expenses.





	In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party. There is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future.

	As of March 31, 2017, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates







	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, (U.S. GAAP), on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern.


	Due to the uncertainty of the Companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. Our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.







	The preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.







	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K


	for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed on October 13, 2016 (Annual Report)


	, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.







	(a)




	Related Party Debt








	Convertible Notes










	Occasionally, we obtain financing from related parties in the form of notes payable convertible into shares of our common stock. We analyze the terms of such convertible notes payable to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable and warrants as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.







	We include the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of convertible notes payable in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method.  We also estimate the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of our common stock as of the date of issuance.







	Convertible notes to related parties are separately identified in our financial statements.







	Non-convertible Notes







	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable and are identified in our financial statements.







	We also disclose significant terms of all transactions with related parties.







	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.








	ITEM 3. 







	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.





	 


	Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).  








	11







	 






	ITEM 4. 




	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.





	 



	Disclosures Control and Procedures






	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:





	·


	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;





	·


	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and





	·


	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.





	As of March 31, 2017, our CEO evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and analyze such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on such evaluation, our CEO has concluded that as of March 31, 2017, the disclosure controls and procedure of the Company were effective.





	As of March 31, 2017, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.





	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31, 2017.





	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1), (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.






	12







	 






	Managements Remediation Initiatives






	In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:





	We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.





	Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.





	We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2017. Additionally, we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year 2017.






	Changes in internal controls over financial reporting







	Except the above, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	December 31, 2016




	(Unaudited)










	(1)




	Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies






	Basis of Presentation





	The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements of Aladdin International, Inc. (the Company or Aladdin) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the periods then ended have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys June 30, 2016 audited financial statements. The results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no business operations, has had recurring losses and has negative working capital and shareholders deficits, and due to the uncertainty of the Companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of its business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party.  There is no assurance that these advances will continue in the future.  The condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  





	The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed on October 13, 2016 (Annual Report).  Interim results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.





	(a)


	Related Party Debt






	Convertible Note






	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable which are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock. The Company accounts for convertible notes and debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options; ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity; ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity; EITF 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock; and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.





	The terms of such convertible notes payable are analyzed by management to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.





	The intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of related party convertible notes payable are included in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method. The Companys management also estimates the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of the Companys common stock as of the date of issuance.






	Non-convertible Note






	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable. The Company accounts for such notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470, Debt, and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

	Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies


	(Continued)






	(b)


	Concentrations





	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.  At December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had no amounts of cash or cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by agencies of the U.S. Government.





	(c)


	Reclassifications





	Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.





	(d)


	Operating Leases





	The Company accounts for operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13,

	Accounting for Leases,

	and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Technical Bulletin 88

	−

	1,

	“


	Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases.

	”


	Accordingly, rent expense under operating leases for the Company

	’

	s administrative office is recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of each lease, inclusive of predetermined rent escalations or modifications.






	(2)




	Capital Stock






	Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, the Company is authorized to issue 780,000,000 shares of common stock with $.001 par value and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with $.001 par value. There were 4,548,435 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.





	There were no preferred shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016.





	The Company occasionally incurs expenses that are paid by related parties. When the related parties do not expect repayment these amounts are recorded as increases in additional paid-in capital. However, during the six months ended December 31, 2016 related parties paid no expenses. Also included in additional paid in capital is $7,442 of imputed interest incurred during the six months ended December 31, 2016.






	(3)




	Related Party Transactions






	Before February 7, 2016, the Company used the offices of its former President for its minimal office facility needs for no consideration. No provision for these costs has been provided since it has been determined that they are immaterial.





	On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Rewards Development (Billion Rewards), a British Virgin Island corporation whose beneficial owner is Mr. Shi Jianxiang, entered into a Loan Agreement (October Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the October Loan) to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2016 extended to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. Under the October Loan Agreement, if the Company conducted an offering for a total amount of $2,000,000 (the Offering) on or before February 28, 2016, the October Loan would be automatically converted into shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company at the conversion price equal to the purchase price in the Offering. In addition, pursuant to the October Loan Agreement, Billion Rewards would be entitled to convert any portion or all of the October Loan into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at the conversion price of volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg for twenty trading days prior to such conversion. The Company estimated the intrinsic value of this embedded conversion feature and recorded it as a discount to related party convertible debt of $8,059 and amortized it fully as of June 30, 2016. On November 5, 2015 the Company received the October Loan in the amount of $200,000; the October Loan remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016.  On May 5, 2016 the Company and Billion Rewards entered into an amendment  agreement (Amendment No 1 to October Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to modify and amend the October Loan to make it nonconvertible and to extend the due date from April 30, 2016 to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest.





	On January 7, 2016 the Company and Billion Rewards entered into a loan agreement (January Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $100,000 (the January Loan) to the Company with the maturity date of January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. On January 12, 2016 the Company received the January Loan in the amount of $100,000; the January loan remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.






	 




	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.







	Certain statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, anticipate, estimate, plan, potential, project, continuing, ongoing, expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.







	The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.







	The "Company", "we," "us," and "our," refer to Aladdin International, Inc.







	Overview






	Aladdin International, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota on May 3, 1972. The Company was a franchisee of fast food restaurants in Milwaukee, Wisconsin until the franchised restaurants were sold in October 1998. Since June 2010, the Company has had insignificant operations and assets consisting solely of cash. As such, the Company is presently defined as a "shell" company under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).





	On February 14, 2008, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Michael Friess and Sanford Schwartz, both of whom have been successful in completing merger transactions between public blank-check companies they controlled with private operating companies. The Stock Purchase Agreement provided that some time following the sale of the Companys real estate and the distribution of the sale proceeds to the Companys shareholders, each of Mr. Friess and Mr. Schwartz would purchase 1,819,374 shares of the Companys common stock (representing 40% of the then-to-be outstanding shares of the Companys common stock) for $10,000. On June 24, 2010, the Company sold the real estate. The Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.148 per share paid on May 6, 2011, to its shareholders of record on March 31, 2011. On July 16, 2014, in connection with the sale of the shares to Mr. Friess and Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Friess and Mr. Schwartz were appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, the then current Directors resigned from the Board, Mr. Friess was appointed CEO of the Company, and Mr. Schwartz was appointed CFO and Secretary.





	On November 25, 2014, the Company held a shareholder meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of the Company to seven hundred eighty million (780,000,000) shares of common stock and to authorize the creation of 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock.





	On July 20, 2015, Mr. Michael Friess and Mr. Sanford Schwartz (each, a Seller, together, the Sellers) and Billion Rewards Development Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation (the Purchaser), entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which the Sellers sold to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser purchased from the Sellers, an aggregate of 3,638,748 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the Shares), which represented 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock for the purchase price of $300,000.





	The closing of the transaction occurred on July 20, 2015 (the Closing). In connection with the Purchase Agreements, Mr. Sanford Schwartz resigned as the CFO and director of the Company, and Mr. Michael Friess resigned as a CEO and president of the Company. Mr. Ningdi Chen was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary, and director of the Company as of July 20, 2015. As a result of the transactions, control of the Company passed to the Purchaser (the Change of Control Transaction). Post-Closing, Michael Friess resigned as a director effective on the tenth day following the Companys mailing of this Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 to its shareholders (the Effective Date), which occurred on July 23, 2015. Immediately after the Closing, the Shares acquired by the Purchaser comprised 80% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company.

	The Company has opted to become a "blank check" company and to further engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. At this time, the Company's purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation.





	The Company has opted to register its common stock pursuant to section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) in an effort to maximize shareholder value. The best use and primary attraction of the Company as a merger partner or acquisition vehicle will be its status as a reporting public company. Any business combination or transaction is expected to result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders of the Company.





	The proposed business activities described herein classify the Company as a "blank check" company. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any additional offerings of the Company's securities, either debt or equity, until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein.





	At this time, the Company's purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. The Company will not restrict its search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. This discussion of the proposed business is intentionally general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company's virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because the Company has nominal assets and limited financial resources. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to shareholders of the Company because it will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.





	The Company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. The Company may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. However, there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful.





	The Company intends to advertise and promote the Company privately. The Company has not yet prepared any notices or advertisements.





	The Company anticipates that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. Such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes), for all shareholders and other factors.





	The Company has little or no capital with which to provide the owners of business opportunities with any significant cash or other assets. However, management believes the Company will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in a publicly registered company without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering. The owners of the business opportunities will, however, incur significant legal and accounting costs in connection with the acquisition of a business opportunity, including the costs of preparing Form 8- K's, 10-K's and 10-Q's, agreements and related reports and documents. The Exchange Act specifically requires that any merger or acquisition candidate comply with all applicable reporting requirements, which include providing audited financial statements to be included within the numerous filings relevant to complying with the Exchange Act. The officers and directors of the Company have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data which would support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity.

	The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, the officer and director of the Company. Management intends to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities, which may be brought to its attention through present associations of the Company's officer and director. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, management will consider such matters as the available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the Company; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition of acceptance of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. The Company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained prior to the closing of the proposed transaction.





	The Company will not restrict its search for any specific kind of firms, but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its corporate life. It is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer. The Company may also, at its discretion, obtain funds in one or more private placements to be used to finance and consummate a merger or acquisition of a business opportunity.





	On October 1, 2015, Kai Ming Zhao accepted an offer prescribed in the offer letter ("Offer Letter") from the Company to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

	On May 20, 2016, the Board of Directors of Aladdin International Inc. (Company) accepted the resignation of Mr. Kai Ming Zhao as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company, effective immediately after the election of Mr. Qinghua Chen to the Board of Directors as described below and the filing of this Form 8-K. Mr. Zhous resignation as an officer does not result from any disagreement with the Company, its management, or the Board of Directors, on any matter relating to the Companys operations, policies or practices. Also on May 20, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Qinghua Chen as a Director and, effective upon the resignation of Mr. Zhao referenced above, as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Also on May 20, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation of Mr. Ningdi Chen as, effective immediately after the election of Mr. Qinghua Chen to the Board of Directors. Mr. Ningdi Chens resignation as a Director does not result from any disagreement with the Company, its management, or the Board of Directors, on any matter relating to the Companys operations, policies or practices.





	On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Reward Development Limited ("Billion Reward"), our majority shareholder which owns 80% of total issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement ("October Loan Agreement"), whereby Billion Reward agrees to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the "October Loan") to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2016 extended to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. Under the October Loan Agreement, if the Company conducts an offering for a total amount of $2,000,000 (the "Offering") on or before February 28, 2016, the Loan will be automatically converted into shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Stock") of the Company at the conversion price equal to the purchase price in the Offering. Pursuant to the October Loan Agreement, Billion Reward will be entitled to convert any portion or all of the October Loan into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at the conversion price of volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg for twenty trading days prior to such conversion. On November 5, 2015, the Company received the October Loan in the amount of $200,000; the October Loan remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016. On May 5, 2016 the Company and Billion Rewards entered into an amendment  agreement (Amendment No 1 to October Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to modify and amend the October Loan to make it nonconvertible and to extend the due date from April 30, 2016 to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest.





	On January 7, 2016 the Company and Billion Rewards entered into a loan agreement (January Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $100,000 (the January Loan) to the Company with the maturity date of January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. On January 12, 2016 the Company received the January Loan in the amount of $100,000; the January loan remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016.

	On May 19, 2016 the Company and Billion Rewards entered into a loan agreement (June Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Rewards agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $43,840 (the June Loan) to the Company with the maturity date of April 30, 2017 and bearing no interest. On June 9, 2016 the Company received the June Loan in the amount of $43,840; the June loan remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016.





	As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $675,471. Our net loss for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2016 were $48,559 and $94,093, respectively. Our losses have principally been attributed to a lack of revenues while incurring operating expenses.

	Net Loss






	Operating expenses were composed of audit and professional fees and general and administrative expenses. The net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $94,093 and $106,594, respectively.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources  






	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.





	It is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the Company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the Company. It is anticipated that the Company will require approximately $200,000 during the next 12 months to implement its business plan. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has limited capital with which to pay anticipated expenses.





	In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party. There is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future.





	As of December 31, 2016, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates







	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, (U.S. GAAP), on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern.


	Due to the uncertainty of the Companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. Our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.







	The preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.







	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K


	for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed on October 13, 2016 (Annual Report)


	, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.







	(a)




	Related Party Debt








	Convertible Notes









	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable which are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock. The Company accounts for convertible notes and debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options; ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity; ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity; EITF 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock; and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.









	11







	 





	The terms of such convertible notes payable are analyzed by management to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.





	The intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of related party convertible notes payable are included in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method. The Companys management also estimates the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of the Companys common stock as of the date of issuance.






	Non-convertible Notes






	The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable. The Company accounts for such notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470, Debt, and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.








	ITEM 3. 







	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.





	 


	Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).  








	ITEM 4. 




	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.





	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Management maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	In connection with the preparation of this annual report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2016.





	Based on that evaluation, management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.






	Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting






	As of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of managements last evaluation.

	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of December 31, 2016, using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Control  Intergrated Framework as a basis for our assessment.





	Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.





	A material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the Companys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, we identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. (1) The Company has inadequate staffing and supervision within the bookkeeping and accounting operations of our company. The relatively small number of employees who have bookkeeping and accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system. The inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform


	timely and effective reviews. (2) The Company has installed accounting software that does not prevent erroneous or unauthorized changes to previous reporting periods and does not provide an adequate audit trail of entries made in the accounting software. (3) The Company has a limited corporate governance structure. Our corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors, none of whom are independent under applicable standards: we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee. Because our Board of Directors only meets periodically throughout the year, some of our corporate governance functions are not performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transactions including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures relating to those

	transactions.

	(4) Certain internal controls were not fully operating and effective in a manner to effectively support the requirements of the financial reporting and period-end close process. Principally, this related to the controls and procedures surrounding the consistent completion, review and approval of key balance sheet account analyses and reconciliations. Material errors were corrected in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2016. It is reasonably possible that, if not remediated, these control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements in a future annual or interim period. Management is aware of these issues and is planning to implement more stringent controls in the future.





	As we are not aware of any instance in which the company failed to identify or resolve a disclosure matter or failed to perform a timely and effective review, we determined that the addition of personnel to our bookkeeping and accounting operations is not an efficient use of our resources at this time and not in the interest of shareholders.





	Because of the above condition, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2016.

ALADDIN INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2016
(Unaudited)

(1)
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements of Aladdin International, Inc. (the Company or Aladdin) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the periods then ended have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys June 30, 2015 audited financial statements. The results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no business operations and recurring losses and has negative working capital and shareholders deficits, and due to the uncertainty of the Companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of its business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party.  There is no assurance that these advances will continue in the future.  The condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  

The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015, filed on September 25, 2015 (Annual Report).  Interim results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.

Change in Control of the Company 

On July 20, 2015, Michael Friess and Sanford Schwartz (collectively, the Shareholders), majority shareholders of the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Billion Reward Development Limited (Billion Reward), a British Virgin Islands corporation, pursuant to which the Shareholders sold to Billion Reward  an aggregate of 3,638,748 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company (the Majority Interests) for $300,000, resulting in Billion Reward owning approximately 80% of the total outstanding shares of the Company, and a change in control of the Company. 

In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on July 20, 2015, Michael Friess, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company resigned from all of his officer positions with the Company except that his resignation as a member of the Board was not effective until the tenth day following the Companys mailing of the Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 to its shareholders as of the record date of July 20, 2015. In addition, Sanford Schwartz, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and member of the Board resigned from all of his positions with the Company. 

Also effective on July 20, 2015, Ningdi Chen was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Board. 

On October 1, 2015, Kai Ming Zhao accepted an offer letter (Offer Letter) from the Company to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Zhaos total salary is $150,000 per year, with cash bonus based on performance. 

On October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation of Mr. Ningdi Chen as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company.

(1)
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies, Continued 

Also on October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Kai Ming Zhao as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Kai Ming Zhao is also the principal accounting officer of the Company. 

Significant Accounting Policies

Refer to the Companys Annual Report for a summary of significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, other than the addition of the policies below regarding related party debt and operating leases.  

(a)
Related Party Debt

Convertible Note

The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable which are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock. The Company accounts for convertible notes and debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options; ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity; ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity; EITF 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock; and ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

The terms of such convertible notes payable are analyzed by management to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.

The intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of related party convertible notes payable are included in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method. The Companys management also estimates the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of the Companys common stock as of the date of issuance.

Non-convertible Note

The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable. The Company accounts for such notes following the guidance set forth in ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

(b)
Concentrations

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.  At March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company had no amounts of cash or cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by agencies of the U.S. Government.

(c)
Reclassifications

Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, anticipate, estimate, plan, potential, project, continuing, ongoing, expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

The "Company", "we," "us," and "our," refer to Aladdin International, Inc. 

Overview 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota on May 3, 1972. The Company was a franchisee of fast food restaurants in Milwaukee, Wisconsin until the franchised restaurants were sold in October 1998. The Company held a shareholder meeting on November 25, 2014 to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada through merging into Aladdin International, Inc. incorporated in Nevada and amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of the Company to eight hundred million (800,000,000) shares. The shares of stock consist of 780,000,000 shares of common stock with full voting rights and a par value of $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The merger of the Minnesota company into the Nevada company was effective on December 23, 2014 and the Articles of Merger were filed on December 30, 2014. 

On July 20, 2015, Michael Friess and Sanford Schwartz (collectively, the "Shareholders"), majority shareholders of the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Billion Reward Development Limited (the "Purchaser"), a British Virgin Islands corporation, pursuant to which the Shareholders sold to the Purchaser an aggregate of 3,638,748 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company (the "Majority Interests") for $300,000 (the "Change in Control Transaction"). 

In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on July 20, 2015, Michael Friess, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President and member of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company resigned from all of his officer positions with the Company except that his resignation as a member of the Board was not effective until the tenth day following the Company's mailing of the Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 to its shareholders as of the record date of July 20, 2015. Sanford Schwartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and member of the Board resigned from all of his positions with the Company. Also effective on July 20, 2015, Ningdi Chen was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Board. 

Since June 2010, the Company has had insignificant operations and assets consisting primarily of cash. As such, the Company is presently defined as a "shell" company under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). The Company has opted to become a "blank check" company and to further engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. At this time, the Company's purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. The Company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. The Company may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. However, there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful.

The Company is planning to acquire a private company for a business combination and has had informal discussions with potential acquisition targets.  Previously disclosed informal discussions regarding a potential acquisition of a company in the business of creating and monetizing products based on licensed film and television intellectual property have ceased. No definitive documentation has been entered into in connection with any acquisition and there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully make any acquisition. If an acquisition occurs, the Company would likely issue a substantial number of additional shares of its common stock at a price which could be substantially below the current trading price of the Companys common stock. There may be no independent valuation done of any proposed target and there can be no assurance that the value of any proposed target would approximate the value of securities of the Company to be issued in connection with such acquisition.

On October 1, 2015, Kai Ming Zhao accepted an offer prescribed in the offer letter ("Offer Letter") from the Company to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Zhao's total salary is $150,000 per year, with cash bonus based on performance. On October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation of Mr. Ningdi Chen as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Also on October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Kai Ming Zhao as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Kai Ming Zhao is also the principal accounting officer of the Company. 

On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Reward Development Limited ("Billion Reward"), our majority shareholder which owns 80% of total issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement ("October Loan Agreement"), whereby Billion Reward agrees to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the "October Loan") to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2016 extended to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. Under the October Loan Agreement, if the Company conducts an offering for a total amount of $2,000,000 (the "Offering") on or before February 28, 2016, the Loan will be automatically converted into shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Stock") of the Company at the conversion price equal to the purchase price in the Offering. Pursuant to the October Loan Agreement, Billion Reward will be entitled to convert any portion or all of the October Loan into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at the conversion price of volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg for twenty trading days prior to such conversion. On November 5, 2015, the Company received the October Loan in the amount of $200,000; the October Loan remains outstanding as of March 31, 2016.

On January 7, 2016 the Company and Billion Reward entered into a loan agreement (January Loan Agreement), whereby Billion Reward agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $100,000 (the January Loan) to the Company with the maturity date of January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. On January 12, 2016 the Company received the January Loan in the amount of $100,000.

As of March 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was ($538,878). Our stockholders' deficit as of March 31, 2016 was ($224,134). Our net loss for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2016 were ($139,868) and ($252,622), respectively. Our losses have principally been attributed to a lack of revenues while incurring operating expenses. 

The following table provides selected condensed interim financial data about our company for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended June 30, 2015. For detailed financial information, see the condensed interim financial statements included elsewhere herein.

Operating expenses are comprised of audit, professional fees, payroll, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses increased by $124,639 or 1,443.6%, from $8,634 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $133,273 during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Also, operating expenses increased by $210,444, or 670.7%, from $31,376 during the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to $241,820 during the nine months ended March 31, 2016.  These increases are primarily due to payroll expenses associated with a new executive officer and assistant hired in fiscal 2016, rent for office space and legal services associated with potential debt and equity financings and potential business combination. 
 
Net Loss 

The net losses for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ($139,868), and ($8,634), respectively, and for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ($252,622) and ($31,376), respectively. The increased net losses are primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above.

Total cash flows increased by $1,886, or 468% from $403 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to $2,289 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in cash flows from financing activities offsetting a decrease in cash flows from operating activities. 

Cash flows from operating activities were mainly comprised of the operating loss and increase in pre-paid expenses and security deposits offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. These cash flows decreased by $284,373, or 983.6% from ($28,911) for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to ($313,284) for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was due to increases in the operating loss of $221,246 or 705.1%, as discussed above, and prepaid expenses and deposits of $98,869, or 56,496.6%, being partially offset by increased accrued liabilities of $24,935, or 1,088.9%, from $2,290 to $27,225 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The changes in prepaid expenses, deposits and accrued liabilities mainly resulted from prepaid legal fees and the operating lease of office space (refer to Note 4). 

Financing cash flows increased by $286,259, or 976.5%, from $29,314 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to $315,573 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. These changes were primarily the result of the $200,000 related party convertible note, the $100,000 related party loan (refer to Note 3) and $15,573 increased additional paid-in capital.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. 

It is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the Company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the Company. It is anticipated that the Company will require approximately $200,000 during the next 12 months to implement its business plan. As of March 31, 2016, the Company has limited capital with which to pay anticipated expenses.

In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party. There is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future.

As of March 31, 2016, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, (U.S. GAAP), on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. Due to the uncertainty of the Companys ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. Our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

The preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015, filed on September 25, 2015 (Annual Report), we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.


11


 

(a)
Related Party Debt

Convertible Notes 

Occasionally, we obtain financing from related parties in the form of notes payable convertible into shares of our common stock. We analyze the terms of such convertible notes payable to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable and warrants as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.

We include the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of convertible notes payable in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method.  We also estimate the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of our common stock as of the date of issuance.

Convertible notes to related parties are separately identified in our financial statements. 

Non-convertible Notes

The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable and are identified in our financial statements.

We also disclose significant terms of all transactions with related parties.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

ITEM 3. 
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
 
Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).  

ITEM 4. 
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
 
Disclosures Control and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

·
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

·
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

·
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

As of March 31, 2016, our CEO evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and analyze such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on such evaluation, our CEO has concluded that as of March 31, 2016, the disclosure controls and procedure of the Company were effective. 

As of March 31, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31, 2016. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1), (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Managements Remediation Initiatives 

In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2016. Additionally, we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year 2016. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

Except the above, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

View ALADDIN INTERNATIONAL INC /MN/ Quartely report 2/2016 SEC Filing for free. The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
