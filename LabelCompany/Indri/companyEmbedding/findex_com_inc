Findex.Com, Inc. Enters Manufacturing and Distribution Joint Venture Agreement with Nanotech Materials LLC
Aug 23 16
Findex.com Inc. entered into a certain manufacturing and distribution joint venture agreement with Nanotech Materials LLC. The agreement centers around a certain rubber-glass fusion coating proprietary technology/material developed and possessed by Nanotech, and the purpose of the joint venture is to commercially exploit this technology/material through a combination of product manufacturing and global/worldwide distribution, marketing, and sales. To date, there have been no sales of product based on this technology/material. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company will be manufacturing/producing the subject product for the benefit of the joint venture, as well as playing a role, both individually and together with Nanotech, in its distribution, marketing, and sales. The JV will not exist as a separate legal entity, but rather as a contractual collaboration. It is not expected that the JV will have any employees, but rather rely, for purposes of production, on production staff, and, for purposes of marketing, on employees of each the two co-venturers as well as independent manufacturer’s representatives. The agreement details a basic operational framework within which the JV will be conducted, and provides a certain governance framework for managing the JV and resolving potential disputes between the two co-venturers. In general, the decision-making associated with the JV will be shared equally by the two co-venturers, though certain exceptions exist based on relative and specific economic risk. The agreement lays out a formula for calculating profits of the JV on a quarter-annual basis, which profits will be divided equally between the two co-venturers. It further provides certain detail for equitably determining the respective co-venturers’ interests in the assets and liabilities of the JV at any given time in the event of a liquidation, voluntary or otherwise. In addition to a variety of customary representations and warranties ordinarily included in similar contractual joint venture agreements, the agreement also contains certain covenants surrounding and governing the ongoing obligations and commitments of the co-venturers to one another, including those focused on maintaining the secrecy of the underlying technology. The agreement additionally provides for certain indemnification obligations between the co-venturers for liabilities and/or losses. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will result in the JV being maintained for a term of 10 years. Termination may occur by mutual consent of the co-venturers, sale of the business of the JV, or unilateral withdrawal by either one of the co-venturers. In the event that Nanotech withdraws unilaterally at any time, the Company retains the right to continue to produce and sell product based on the proprietary technology around which the JV is centered.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
