WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Phase Forward (NASDAQ: PFWD), a leading provider of data management 
      solutions for clinical trials and drug safety, today announced that Russell 
      J. Campanello, the company’s senior vice president of human 
      resources and administration, has been honored with a Stevie® 
      Award for the Human Resources Executive of the Year. The award was 
      presented at The 7th Annual American Business AwardsSM 
      gala this past Monday night at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York 
      City.
    


      Stevie Awards were presented in over 40 categories this year including 
      Best Overall Company of the Year, Executive of the Year and Corporate 
      Social Responsibility Program of the Year. More than 2,600 entries from 
      companies of all sizes and in virtually every industry were submitted 
      for consideration. In addition, more than 200 executives across the 
      country participated in the judging process to determine the Finalists 
      and Stevie Award winners.
    

      “It’s gratifying to be presented with this award and recognized among 
      the many talented executives in the human resources profession,” said 
      Campanello. “I’m grateful to the organizers of the Stevie Awards and to 
      the dedicated employees of Phase Forward, whose hard work and commitment 
      I find inspiring and energizing.”
    

      Campanello was recognized for his efforts in creating an environment 
      that maximizes the contributions of Phase Forward’s talented employees. 
      He has focused in particular on fostering an atmosphere of consistent 
      and open communication, soliciting employee feedback through multiple 
      channels on a wide variety of issues, and responding to the feedback 
      with both formal programs and less formal interpersonal communication. A Boston 
      Globe article about companies’ efforts to communicate with their 
      employees regarding the economic downturn cited Campanello’s emphasis on 
      “honesty and transparency.”
