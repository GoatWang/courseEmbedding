Today, thanks to Century Casinos, they can do basically the same thing (but via midsized regional casinos, rather than through prospecting). The company's Womacks Casino & Hotel in Cripple Creek offers some 440 slot machines and video devices, as well as a handful of gaming tables. It also owns the Century Casino & Hotel in Central City, Colorado, and another Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton, Canada. In addition, it operate four cruise ship casinos and is the casino concessionaire for cruise lines run by TUI Cruises, a joint venture between German travel operator TUI and #2 cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean.

Mbps, or megabits per second, is the speed of your Internet connection. Higher Mbps speeds will load web pages more quickly, allow more devices to run on the same connection simultaneously, and enable fast download speeds for music, photos, streaming movies and more.









Go with CenturyLink® High-Speed Internet and  choose from a wide range of available speeds.
