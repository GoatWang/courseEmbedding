If you would like a go-kart that is a little different and yet still cool then choose the BERG Street-X for the greatest moves. This green race monster is steered by moving your body without losing your balance. This is inspired by the movement of motorbike and racing car drivers when they lean into corners. In addition, the BERG Street-X has pneumatic tyres, making it extra comfortable to ride. The BFR system allows you to brake using the pedals, but also to reverse immediately after coming to a standstill. Give your child something really special with the unique go-kart.

Petition · Jerry Berg: Microsoft needs to add an 'off' option to telemetry for Windows 10 · Change.org

Petitioning CEO Microsoft Satya NadellaDecision makersSatya NadellaCEO MicrosoftMicrosoft needs to allow Windows 10 users to opt out of telemetry data collection!Jerry Berg Duvall, WAJerry BergDuvall, WA13,991SupportersUnder the leadership of new CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has changed their company policies to violate the trust of their customers by collecting personally identifiable data without our knowledge or consent in the Windows 10 consumer version of their operating system. Microsoft has made some progress in the latest Windows 10 Creators Update to disclose some the information they are gathering but offer no mechanism to disable the personal data gathering entirely on the consumer based versions of their Windows 10 Operating System.
The Enterprise versions of their software have off setting to prevent Windows 10 from sending any personal data to Microsoft from machines running that variant. However, they have not extended this option to the consumer versions of Windows 10 that we all run on our desktops and laptop computers. Microsoft has disclosed some of the information they gather in the two available modes called 'basic' and 'full' however the basic setting which is the lowest level of personal data gathered still collects thousands of fields, many of which people are uncomfortable sharing.
Microsoft has also gone on record stating that the data they collect is not 'personally identifiable' because they don't have access to the databases that contain details about the end user but they fail to mention that everything is logged under the 'Windows Live' account the person is using on the system along with their IP address which can be traced back to the system and confirmed with the MAC address of the networking hardware which is also sent to them as a part of the data that is gathered. Not to mention they collect text fields that could contain your name, address, phone #, credit card information, etc. This means that Microsoft has the capaibility to link all the data collected from your system in the background 24/7 back to you personally if they chose to or they are compelled to by a 3rd party.
This petition is to encourage Microsoft to offer the same 'off' option for data collection in all versions of the Windows 10 operating system and not just the enterprise version of the software. Microsoft has no right to consume our bandwidth to send our personal data to their databases for their own personal gain. Microsoft hides behind the message that this data is all collected to make the product better for us and it should not concern us in the slightest. If you do your research on the data actually gathered you will see that much of it has absolutely no use in debugging or making software better but rather would have a purpose for market research and targeted advertisement. 
Let's all sign this petition and encourage Microsoft to do the right thing by providing an 'off' option for data collection in every version of the Windows 10 operating system and not just the enterprise version that is used by businesses. I would also like to note the reason that an 'off' option exists in the enterprise version of the product is because hospitals and other instutitions would be violating their policies and laws by allowing Microsoft to collect potentially private and sensitive data from those machines. Now ask yourself. "Why don't I have this same right to protect my information, bandwidth, identity and intellectual property on my own machine?"
Please watch my full video on this topic and please share it with as many people as you can and let's hold Microsoft accountable and get them to do the right thing. The CEO Satya Nadella of Microsoft will personally receive this petition as more signatures are gathered and I've also received some interest from some local and international news outlets to cover this story if we get enough exposure.Link to videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFbAqICUJoThis petition will be delivered to:CEO MicrosoftSatya NadellaRead the letterLetter toCEO Microsoft Satya NadellaMicrosoft needs to add an 'off' option to stop collecting telemetry from machines that request it. Currently only the Enterprise SKU of the Windows 10 operating system supports this option and all consumer level versions still must at least select a 'basic' option which sends 90% of the overall collected data to Microsoft which is unacceptable. The end users should be allowed to lock down their machine from sending data that could be sensitive to Microsoft. Doctors, Lawyers and other professionals that have data on their computer that cannot be seen by outside sources are at risk because of Microsofts data collection policies. This has to change and it needs to change quickly. Please listen to this petition and the thousands of people that don't want Microsoft spying on them and add this option to the consumer SKU's and make the option highly visible and explained during the installation of the Creators Update or any future update.OKMicrosoft Windows 10microsoftwindows 10privacy rightsPrivacy ViolationJerry Berg started this petition with a single signature, and now has 13,991 supporters.

Our Story


Berg Drywall was founded in 1967 by Jerry A. Berg. The first “shop” was located in Deephaven, MN with about ten employees. The company showed steady growth over the years through the highs and lows of the construction industry. Jerry’s wife, Kathy Berg, joined the company in 1988 overseeing the finances of the organization. As the company expanded in the field, the office needs expanded as well. Berg moved to a newer facility allowing for additional staff. Our current CEO, Randy Schneewind joined the company as a project manager in 1992, shortly after college.
The drywall industry was new for Randy and he worked hard to learn about the industry. As he grew within the business, so did his customer relationships. The company began to take on larger projects and expand their services. Randy was promoted to Vice President in 1999. Jerry, Kathy and Randy worked together to build the company with a shared vision of customer relationships maintained by a quality job every time. Relationships based on mutual respect and understanding were always at the core of the business. In 2005, Jerry proudly appointed Randy as President of Berg.
Randy purchased the company with two minority partners in 2005, as Jerry and Kathy moved into retirement. In February of 2013, Randy transitioned to CEO and warmly welcomed Brian Teeters to the company as President. Offering new services allows our customers more choices for a “one-stop” shop for drywall, painting, plastering and acoustical services. Berg continues to work nationwide expanding on the core values that originally started the company and continue to direct the entity today.

About
Jerry Berg has been drawing, painting and 
      printmaking from a very early age.  In college 
      he was then guided down a path into the 
      realm of graphic design and soon discovered 
      the excitement and challenge of interactive 
      design in the form of CD-ROM and early 
      web site development.  After completing
      a Master of Fine Art in Visual Communication he moved to San Francisco.
      In San Francisco he was a founding member of the team and the Creative Director that started Golf Media, Inc. which was a design firm that created CD-ROM and Web sites for the largest golf resorts and clubs around the world, including Pebble Beach, Loch Lomond, The Prince and many more.
Jerry eventually left to co-found a new design firm, called Spark Online, Inc., taking emerging interactive design techniques and using that technology for advertising and other marketing purposes on the web.  The firm was eventually purchased and Jerry moved on.
After Spark Online, Jerry created his own design firm and bringing on a few select team members from his previous companies and started creating highly creative and innovative interactive web sites and online advertising for many Fortune 500 companies.  His clients include ABC, Buick, Chevy, Armor All, Chase Bank, Charles Schwab, and many many more.
With a passion for the studio arts, Jerry picked up a paintbrush, knocked off the rust and started painting as well as printmaking again.  Spending time on the weekends in figure drawing drop-in sessions as well as drop-in printmaking studios to get used to traditional image making techniques again. 
Throughout his career, Jerry has always desired to pass on his wealth of knowledge as an innovator in interactive design to new designers.  After much success and thought, Jerry scaled down his company, took a position as a professor at a university in Louisiana, and moved his family.  This move has afforded him a good deal of time to further his painting career as well as spend more time with his other passions which include his wonderful wife and beautiful daughter.
