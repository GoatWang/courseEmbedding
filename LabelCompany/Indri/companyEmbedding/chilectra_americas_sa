Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Fitch Affirms Enersis Americas S.A.'s IDRs at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Enersis Americas S.A.'s IDRs at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable
    





September 28, 2016 05:51 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed Enersis Americas S.A.'s Long-Term Foreign and 
      Local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB', and long-term 
      national scale rating at 'AA-(cl)'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A 
      complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The ratings affirmation follows the company's recent announcement to 
      proceed with a public acquisition of shares ("OPA" by its Spanish 
      acronym) for all shares issued by Endesa Americas S.A. The OPA expires 
      on October 28. This is one of the last steps of the company's 
      reorganization process that started last year and it is expected that 
      the merger will be effective during 2016. The ratings incorporate the 
      assumption that Enersis Americas S.A.'s organizational structure will be 
      simplified by merging the intermediary entities Endesa Americas S.A. and 
      Chilectra Americas S.A. After the transaction has been completed, Endesa 
      Americas' and Chilectra Americas' shares will be exchanged for Enersis 
      Americas' shares.
    

      The operation will be funded with a combination of cash on hand, and 
      incremental debt. Shareholders will have 30 days to exercise their 
      withdrawal rights after Enersis Americas, Endesa Americas and Chilectra 
      Americas approve the merger during their respective extraordinary 
      shareholder meetings. Today, each of the entities approved the merger. 
      Enersis Americas', Endesa Americas' and Chilectra Americas' 
      shareholders' deadline to exercise their withdrawal rights is Oct. 28, 
      2016.
    

      If shareholders exercising the withdrawal rights for Enersis Americas, 
      Endesa Americas and Chilectra Americas exceed 10.0%, 10.0% and 0.91% 
      respectively, the merger will not be formalized and the company may call 
      for another shareholders meeting to submit the merger to a new vote. 
      Fitch believes the future conclusion of the tender offer and merge of 
      Endesa Americas S.A. and Chilectra Americas S.A. into Enersis Americas 
      S.A. is neutral to the company's ratings.
    

      Enersis Americas' investment grade ratings reflect its solid business 
      platform with a strong degree of business and geographic 
      diversification, and solid financial/operational metrics. Enersis 
      Americas operates in four countries in the generation, transmission and 
      distribution businesses, yet is confronted by several economic 
      challenges facing the region, particularly in Brazil (rated 'BB', 
      Outlook Negative) and Argentina (rated 'B', Outlook Stable). The risk of 
      operating in lower rated sovereign environments is somewhat mitigated by 
      the size of the exposure to these higher risk markets; only 30% of the 
      company's 2015 pro forma EBITDA (excluding Chile) relates to 
      non-investment grade countries (Argentina and Brazil) and approximately 
      67% of the dividends paid to Enersis Americas relate to investment grade 
      countries, mainly Colombia.
    

      The Stable Outlook is driven by Enersis Americas' adequate liquidity 
      profile and credit metrics and the expectation that a balanced mix 
      between generation and distributions businesses will be maintained.
    

      Credit risks associated with the company include potential pressures 
      from the shareholder Enel to promote any extraordinary dividends, 
      possible environmental and/or political issues that could result in cost 
      overruns or modifications of projects under construction; although these 
      risks appear manageable. The ratings also consider the company's 
      dependence on dividend payments from its subsidiaries to repay its own 
      debt and incorporate the seasonal and regional cash flow volatility.
    

      STRONG LEVERAGE METRICS:
    

      On a pro forma basis, Enersis Americas maintains a strong capital 
      structure with gross leverage defined as total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA 
      of 1.5x as of December 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was USD2.4 
      billion, versus USD3.4 billion in the predecessor company. Results 
      slightly improved during the first half of 2016 (1H16), with EBITDA of 
      approximately USD1.3 billion, which was approximately 12% higher than 
      1H15 pro forma EBITDA (excluding the Chilean operations). Argentina and 
      Brazil represented approximately 35% of the company's EBITDA generation 
      during the 1H16. Improved results for 2016 were supported by better 
      results in the generation segment in the region, coupled with better 
      results in the distribution business for Argentina and Peru which 
      partially offset the deteriorated results related of the Brazilian 
      distribution business. Fitch expects EBITDA for 2016-2019 to be 
      approximately USD2.5 billion-USD3.3 billion and gross leverage measured 
      as total debt/EBITDA to remain below 2.0x.
    

      MODERATE EXPOSURE TO BRAZIL:
    

      Fitch believes that after the spinoff and as a result of the company's 
      decision to spin-off the Chilean assets from the precedent Enersis 
      portfolio, the volatility on the company's cash flow generation has 
      moderately increased. Brazil's economic downturn led to lower 
      electricity demand and higher energy losses affecting the company's 
      distribution results, which was offset by the improved results in Peru 
      and Argentina. As of December 2015, Brazil and Argentina represented 
      approximately 30% of the company's EBITDA; Fitch believes the company's 
      exposure to Argentina and Brazil is mitigated by the company's solid 
      cash flow generation from the remaining investment grade countries, 
      which comfortably covers its hard currency denominated debt service. Per 
      Fitch's criteria, Enersis Americas applicable country ceiling is Peru's 
      of 'A-', and the ratings are not constrained by the country ceiling of 
      Brazil.
    

      MANAGEABLE INVESTMENT PROGRAM:
    

      Fitch expects capex investment for 2016-2019 to amount approximately 
      USD4 billion, with 75% invested in distribution to mainly reduce losses, 
      which would improve the company's results. Fitch also believes the 
      company's investment plan should not require additional significant 
      indebtedness given the company's solid free cash flow generation. During 
      2015, the company invested USD587 million in generation on a pro forma 
      basis (excluding the Chilean operations). The main investments in 
      generation during 2015 were related to the construction of the hydro 
      terminal El Quimbo (400 MW), in Colombia, which started operations on 
      December 2015.
    

      KEY ASSUMPTIONS
    

      Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Enersis Americas 
      include:
    

      --Total production of 44,000 - 47,000 GWh on average per year.
    

      Average margins per MWh for generation during 2016-2019 of: USD11 for 
      Argentina, USD40 for Brazil, USD78 for Colombia, and USD37 for Peru;
    

      --Average margins per MWh for distribution during 2016-2019 of: USD22 
      for Argentina, USD55 for Brazil, USD77 for Colombia, and USD37 for Peru;
    

      --An average of USD1 billion of annual capex;
    

      --Dividends 50% of net income.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to 
      negative rating actions include:
    

      --A change in Enersis Americas' power generation business' commercial 
      policy that results in an imbalanced long-term contractual position.
    

      --A material and sustained deterioration of credit metrics (reflected in 
      a debt to EBITDA ratio greater than 3.5x and EBITDA to interest coverage 
      below 4x).
    

      --The deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions, and respective 
      sovereign ratings, in the company's key markets.
    

      --A significant increase in Enersis Americas' exposure to non-investment 
      grade countries; a downgrade of Brazil's sovereign rating would not 
      necessarily trigger a downgrade of Enersis Americas' ratings.
    

      Considerations that could lead to a positive rating action (Rating or 
      Outlook) include:
    

      --A material improvement in credit metrics that could be sustained over 
      time.
    

      --A reduction in debt levels and higher earnings retention.
    

      --An improvement in the mix of cash flow generation towards higher 
      credit quality markets would be viewed positively.
    

      Once the company establishes a long-term history of sustained gross debt 
      to adjusted EBITDA ratios under 2.5x level with a balanced geographical 
      and business mix, the company's credit ratings could be upgraded or the 
      Outlook revised to Positive.
    

      LIQUIDITY
    

      The company's liquidity continues to be solid. On a pro forma basis, the 
      company has nearly USD1.7 billion of cash and equivalents as of June 
      2016, and has available committed lines of credit totaling USD211 
      million. This compares favorably with short-term financial debt of 
      USD814 million for the same period.
    

      FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      Enersis Americas S.A.
    

      --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at

      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to
