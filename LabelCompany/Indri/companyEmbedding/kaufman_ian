Canine products — Kauffman’s canine nutrition supplements are created by a licensed and board-certified veterinarian with a Master’s degree in nutrition. Made from natural, non-synthetic nutrients, try our canine supplements to relieve shedding and for better joint, coat and skin health.

Testimonial

Thank you for a great product that my picky mare will actually eat.  I started using it about a year ago when we were battling chronic thrush and I was at my wits end.  When we pulled her shoes for the winter they instantly started chipping apart and I had her re-shod.  Fast forward a year and her hooves are in much better shape.  Not only do we rarely see any thrush but when her shoes came off this year they stayed in one piece.  Thank you! 
– Heather
