†This program is available to U.S. residents who purchase a new Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump integrated with Dexcom G4® CGM technology or a new OneTouch Ping® Insulin Pump between March 14, 2017 and August 30, 2017. To be eligible, patients must be using an out-of-warranty pump from Animas or another manufacturer. Trade-ins cannot be accepted from patients who are new to pumping. In certain cases, trade-ins may be available to patients who are upgrading from an in-warranty, non-Animas pump for clinical reasons with a Letter of Medical Necessity from their healthcare provider. Eligible patients will be billed for their full co-payment amount and will receive up to $800 credit when Animas receives the trade-in pump. Animas must receive the trade-in within 90 days of the new pump purchase. Patients covered under federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, are not eligible to participate. Patients whose insurance prohibits programs that reduce out-of-pocket costs may not participate. This program may be discontinued without notice. Other limitations may apply. To find out if you are eligible and to learn more call the Animas customer service team at 1-866-792-8926.
§The pump upgrade offer is available to U.S. residents who purchase a new Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump with Dexcom G4® CGM technology or a new OneTouch Ping® Insulin Pump between March 14, 2017 and August 30, 2017. This offer is not available for patients who have an insulin pump that is still within its warranty period. Patients covered under federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, are not eligible to participate. This offer is only available for the first 90 days following the launch of Animas’s next CGM-integrated pump. You must return your current Animas® Vibe® System or OneTouch Ping® System within three (3) months of shipment of the upgraded pump. Animas will inform you of the estimated date of shipment for the upgraded pump when you place your upgrade order. Initially, you will be charged $1099.00 for the upgraded pump at the time of shipment. Payment must be made by credit or debit card. Within 3-4 weeks after Animas receives your returned pump, Animas will credit $300.00 to your credit or debit card. The warranty period remaining for your existing pump at the time of the upgrade will apply to the upgraded pump. Animas will not bill any insurance company for the upgraded pump. Participants of previous Animas upgrade programs who have not purchased a full-price pump since their last upgrade are not eligible to participate in this promotion. Animas reserves the right to provide new or refurbished pumps to fulfill any upgrade orders. This promotion is effective for limited time only and may be discontinued without notice. Other limitations may apply. To find out if you are eligible and to learn more call the Animas customer service team at 1-866-792-8926.
*See the Animas® Vibe® or OneTouch Ping® Owner’s Booklet for full warranty details. If your pump is in warranty and you upgrade to a new Animas pump, the warranty period remaining for your existing pump at the time of the upgrade will apply to the upgraded pump.

Important Safety Information





Fine-tuned
insulin delivery
Our Swiss-made motor offers basal rate increments as low as 0.025 U/hr (available range of 0.025 to 25 U/hr) and bolus increments as low as 0.05 U across the available range (0.05 to 35 U) to deliver precise increments of insulin to help the body’s changing needs.





CGM in full color
Compared to the snapshot in time of a blood glucose meter test result, CGM shows you what’s happening between meter tests—that way, you can observe levels and patterns that may not have been detected before. The Animas® Vibe® System shows you where your glucose is heading and how fast, revealing trends and rates of change at a glance.1





Small
introducer needle
The Dexcom G4® PLATINUM Sensor's
introducer needle is tiny, round, and
flexible with one of the smallest
introducer needles on the market.2
Dexcom® has the only sensors approved
for up to 7 days of wear, which means
less frequent changes.





Reliable
accurate sensor
Measured by mean ARD (Absolute Relative
Difference), the industry’s standard for
determining CGM accuracy, the Dexcom
G4® PLATINUM Sensor weighs in at 13%
for exceptional performance and accuracy,
and reliable results.3





Waterproof
durability
Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump is waterproof at 12 feet (3.6 meters) for 24 hours. And because we're committed to your freedom, we've teamed our pump with the Dexcom G4® PLATINUM Sensor and Transmitter, water-resistant up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) for 24 hours.4





Customizable
alerts
The Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump has customizable alarms to indicate high and
low glucose levels. There is also a
built-in, non-adjustable hypoglycemia
safety alert set at 55 mg/dL for extra
peace of mind.

Home > News > Chore-Time Purchases CUBO™ Product Line Assets from CGMChore-Time Purchases CUBO™ Product Line Assets from CGMCUBO™ Air Mixer with Hot Water HeatOctober 2, 2015MILFORD, Indiana, U.S.A. — Chore-Time, a division of CTB, Inc., today announced that it has purchased the intellectual property, including all manufacturing and marketing rights, associated with the CUBO™ Line of air destratifying and heating systems from CGM S.R.L. of Cuneo, Italy.  Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
CUBO Air Destratifiers circulate air downward within a poultry building and distribute it at bird level. By mixing the air, the CUBO Units create more uniform temperatures throughout the poultry house, thereby improving litter condition, eliminating the need for stir fans and promoting more even bird distribution. Various CUBO Models are available including those with and without heat.  Unlike typical poultry house heaters, CUBO units with heat do not introduce a visible flame in the bird chamber of the house.
Chore-Time and CGM agreed in November 2014 to expand their previous relationship by establishing Chore-Time as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customer of CGM with authority to purchase and resell CUBO Systems in select territories around the world. Ownership of the line will permit Chore-Time to further expand its sales of CUBO Systems globally, including stocking CUBO air destratifiers and heaters at its facilities in Indiana and in Poland for supply to customers in the Americas, Europe, Asia and other regions.
Chris Stoler, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Chore-Time, noted, “Chore-Time has enjoyed a successful collaboration with CGM since 2009, and this acquisition was the next logical step in extending Chore-Time’s product offering throughout the world. The CUBO Heating and Air destratifying products have been reducing overall energy usage for chicken producers throughout the world, and we expect them to continue to grow in popularity.”
“We’re really excited to bring this product into our heating systems portfolio, further expanding our full system solutions,” said Dave Laurenz, Global Director of Marketing for Chore-Time.  “Maintaining even air distribution and better litter conditions in the poultry house are vital to promoting a healthy growing environment for the birds,” Laurenz continued.  
CUBO System inventor, Gianpiero Massimino, will consult with Chore-Time on the CUBO Line on an ongoing basis while continuing as CGM’s Chief Executive Officer, further developing and promoting the company’s other products.  “CGM is pleased to see its former CUBO line turned over to a strong, reputable company such as Chore-Time, with global distribution and a worldwide customer base,” added Massimino.  “We’ve appreciated Chore-Time’s trust in working with us these last several years and the success we have enjoyed together.”

†This program is available to U.S. residents who purchase a new Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump integrated with Dexcom G4® CGM technology or a new OneTouch Ping® Insulin Pump between March 14, 2017 and August 30, 2017. To be eligible, patients must be using an out-of-warranty pump from Animas or another manufacturer. Trade-ins cannot be accepted from patients who are new to pumping. In certain cases, trade-ins may be available to patients who are upgrading from an in-warranty, non-Animas pump for clinical reasons with a Letter of Medical Necessity from their healthcare provider. Eligible patients will be billed for their full co-payment amount and will receive up to $800 credit when Animas receives the trade-in pump. Animas must receive the trade-in within 90 days of the new pump purchase. Patients covered under federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, are not eligible to participate. Patients whose insurance prohibits programs that reduce out-of-pocket costs may not participate. This program may be discontinued without notice. Other limitations may apply. To find out if you are eligible and to learn more call the Animas customer service team at 1-866-792-8926.
§The pump upgrade offer is available to U.S. residents who purchase a new Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump with Dexcom G4® CGM technology or a new OneTouch Ping® Insulin Pump between March 14, 2017 and August 30, 2017. This offer is not available for patients who have an insulin pump that is still within its warranty period. Patients covered under federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, are not eligible to participate. This offer is only available for the first 90 days following the launch of Animas’s next CGM-integrated pump. You must return your current Animas® Vibe® System or OneTouch Ping® System within three (3) months of shipment of the upgraded pump. Animas will inform you of the estimated date of shipment for the upgraded pump when you place your upgrade order. Initially, you will be charged $1099.00 for the upgraded pump at the time of shipment. Payment must be made by credit or debit card. Within 3-4 weeks after Animas receives your returned pump, Animas will credit $300.00 to your credit or debit card. The warranty period remaining for your existing pump at the time of the upgrade will apply to the upgraded pump. Animas will not bill any insurance company for the upgraded pump. Participants of previous Animas upgrade programs who have not purchased a full-price pump since their last upgrade are not eligible to participate in this promotion. Animas reserves the right to provide new or refurbished pumps to fulfill any upgrade orders. This promotion is effective for limited time only and may be discontinued without notice. Other limitations may apply. To find out if you are eligible and to learn more call the Animas customer service team at 1-866-792-8926.
*See the Animas® Vibe® or OneTouch Ping® Owner’s Booklet for full warranty details. If your pump is in warranty and you upgrade to a new Animas pump, the warranty period remaining for your existing pump at the time of the upgrade will apply to the upgraded pump.

Important Safety Information





Fine-tuned
insulin delivery
Our Swiss-made motor offers basal rate increments as low as 0.025 U/hr (available range of 0.025 to 25 U/hr) and bolus increments as low as 0.05 U across the available range (0.05 to 35 U) to deliver precise increments of insulin to help the body’s changing needs.





CGM in full color
Compared to the snapshot in time of a blood glucose meter test result, CGM shows you what’s happening between meter tests—that way, you can observe levels and patterns that may not have been detected before. The Animas® Vibe® System shows you where your glucose is heading and how fast, revealing trends and rates of change at a glance.1





Small
introducer needle
The Dexcom G4® PLATINUM Sensor's
introducer needle is tiny, round, and
flexible with one of the smallest
introducer needles on the market.2
Dexcom® has the only sensors approved
for up to 7 days of wear, which means
less frequent changes.





Reliable
accurate sensor
Measured by mean ARD (Absolute Relative
Difference), the industry’s standard for
determining CGM accuracy, the Dexcom
G4® PLATINUM Sensor weighs in at 13%
for exceptional performance and accuracy,
and reliable results.3





Waterproof
durability
Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump is waterproof at 12 feet (3.6 meters) for 24 hours. And because we're committed to your freedom, we've teamed our pump with the Dexcom G4® PLATINUM Sensor and Transmitter, water-resistant up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) for 24 hours.4





Customizable
alerts
The Animas® Vibe® Insulin Pump has customizable alarms to indicate high and
low glucose levels. There is also a
built-in, non-adjustable hypoglycemia
safety alert set at 55 mg/dL for extra
peace of mind.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
