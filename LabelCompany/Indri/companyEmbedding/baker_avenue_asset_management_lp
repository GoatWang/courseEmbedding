Investment Philosophy: How We’re Different

						There are a hundred ways to manage money. 
						And a hundred ways to manage money successfully.
						We practice a prudent approach.
					


					By that we mean actively managing asset allocation with a pragmatic view to managing 
					risk, rather than a passive, conventional buy-and-hold method.
				

					For example, on one end of the spectrum, if the market moves from low risk to high risk, 
					we actively move to raise cash — in an attempt to minimize capital losses.  
					If the market moves on the other end of the spectrum — from “risk-on” to high-risk 
					exuberance — we actively move to take profits, and change the allocation.
				

					Across all of our portfolio strategies we pursue a point-of-view embracing three perspectives: 
					fundamental, technical, and macro.  These are at the heart of our actively managed mix of 
					prudence and pragmatism that has historically given us solid performance while 
					substantially limiting downside risk.
				

					Obviously, this is in stark contrast to those funds or firms who actively seek the highest returns — 
					while assuming the accompanying high levels of risk. For our clients who wish to have a level of 
					peace of mind without moving into full-blown conservatism, BakerAvenue has proven to be an important 
					performing part of their portfolio.

Easily access high-quality real estate deals.
High Returns
LendingHome’s high-yield real estate assets have returns that range from 8% to 10%. We fund all of our loans before they become available to you as investments, so you start earning interest from the very first day you invest.
Backed by Real Assets
We source creditworthy real estate professionals looking for short-term mortgages of 12 months or less to be used for purchasing and rehabilitating homes. These mortgages are backed by the underlying value of the properties that they fund.
Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.
Build a Diversified Portfolio With the Click of a Button
Our online platform makes it easy to build a diverse real estate portfolio. The AutoInvest feature can do the work for you, spreading out your investment across a variety of fractional notes based on your preferences. Or, customize your portfolio by selecting individual loans on your own.
Easy Access
Individuals can access LendingHome’s opportunities with as little as $5,000 per investment and none of the fees of traditional real estate investing. Once you’ve built a portfolio, you’ll get on-demand updates on its performance.

Easily access high-quality real estate deals.
High Returns
LendingHome’s high-yield real estate assets have returns that range from 8% to 10%. We fund all of our loans before they become available to you as investments, so you start earning interest from the very first day you invest.
Backed by Real Assets
We source creditworthy real estate professionals looking for short-term mortgages of 12 months or less to be used for purchasing and rehabilitating homes. These mortgages are backed by the underlying value of the properties that they fund.
Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.
Build a Diversified Portfolio With the Click of a Button
Our online platform makes it easy to build a diverse real estate portfolio. The AutoInvest feature can do the work for you, spreading out your investment across a variety of fractional notes based on your preferences. Or, customize your portfolio by selecting individual loans on your own.
Easy Access
Individuals can access LendingHome’s opportunities with as little as $5,000 per investment and none of the fees of traditional real estate investing. Once you’ve built a portfolio, you’ll get on-demand updates on its performance.



"Unlike other FinTech platforms that offer investments backed by unsecured loans, LendingHome provides an opportunity to participate in the market for senior secured, collateralized mortgage loans backed by real assets."
