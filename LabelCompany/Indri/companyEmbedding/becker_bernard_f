Bernard Becker Named Iowan of the Day 





DES MOINES, IA (07/25/2017) (readMedia)-- The Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation and Cookies Food Products are pleased to present Bernard Becker of Lakota as an Iowan of the Day for the 2017 Iowa State Fair.
Honoring Veterans is a passion that Bernard started sharing with his community when he began the nonprofit "Hunting with Heroes" annual hunting event in Lakota. Each year Bernard hosts United States Marine Corps Purple Heart Medal recipients to his hometown to enjoy a pheasant hunt and banquet in honor of their service. These Marines are based out of the Wounded Warrior Battalion in North Carolina, have been deployed multiple times and suffered from injuries while serving our country.
"Bernie has an unequaled passion for supporting our Veterans, and his nonprofit event has hosted approximately 30 Purple Heart Marines for pheasant hunting and healing in the last six years," says nominator Steve Smith.
Along with "Hunting for Heroes," Bernard is active in his community through other ways. He has served on the Volunteer Ambulance Service for 13 years, as well as the Volunteer Fire Department for 15 years. Serving as the Mayor of Lakota for five years, Bernard's dedication and passion for bettering his town is well known throughout.
Bernard's day of recognition will be on Saturday, August 19 at the 2017 Iowa State Fair. He will be recognized with a presentation on the Anne & Bill Riley stage at 2:30 P.M. Along with accommodations at the Des Moines Marriott Downtown, he will receive a gift bag, grandstand tickets and use of the Iowan of the Day golf cart.
Founded in 1997, the Iowan of the Day program allows the Blue Ribbon Foundation to recognize Iowa's most outstanding individuals. The program continues to honor Iowans across the state who have made a difference in others' lives, while upholding the characteristics associated with Iowa-dependability, integrity, hard work and sense of community.
The Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. Since its inception in 1993, the Foundation has generated more than $135 million for renovations and improvements to the Iowa State Fairgrounds. For more information, please contact the Blue Ribbon Foundation at 1-800-450-3732 or Info@BlueRibbonFoundation.org.

UTQG (Uniform Tire Quality Grade):A government-mandated tire rating system based on a tire's performance in treadwear durability, traction, and temperature resistance. UTQG ratings are branded on the tire's sidewall.  Generally under controlled conditions, the higher the treadwear number (normally between 60-780), the less the tire will wear over time.  Traction is based on lettering AA, A, B, C.  Having an “AA” means the manufacturer rated tire high for traction.  Temperature (A-C) represents how well a tire disperses heat at maximum speeds.  An “A” rating means it dissipates heat at a higher speed.Service Description: A service description is a number and a letter that together describes the tire’s load index and speed rating.   This is generally molded into the sidewall of the tire.  For instance, using 225/60R/18 99H as an example, the 99H denotes the tire’s service description.  (See Load index, and Speed Rating).Load Range: The maximum weight that the tire is designed to carry; dictated by the tire's construction. Metric passenger type tires are offered with a Standard Load (SL) Rating (up to 35 psi), or Extra Load (XL) Rating (up to 41 psi). LT Metric (truck type) tires are offered with ply ratings of C (6 ply), D (8 ply), and E (10 ply) and at various inflation pressures up to 80 psi.Tread Depth: Measured in 32nds of an inch, Tread depth measures the top of the tire tread rubber to the bottom of its grooves.
