 Allegheny Technologies' CEO Hassey To Retire 
 Mon, 02/28/2011 - 8:48am 
 Comments 
 by  

 



PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Specialty metals maker Allegheny Technologies Inc. said Monday that Chairman and CEO L. Patrick Hassey has decided to retire on May 1.
He'll be replaced by Richard Harshman, 54, who was named president and chief operating officer in August as part of the company's succession plan. The 32-year company veteran previously served as an executive vice president and chief financial officer.
"ATI is well-positioned for continued profitable growth as our key global markets expand in the coming years. Now is the right time for a change in leadership," Hassey said in a statement. Hassey has been in the metals business for more than 40 years, and has been with ATI since 2003.
Shares rose 43 cents to $66.79 in midday trading.

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2007 Allegheny Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Fab and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Dan Greenfield, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Dan L. Greenfield - Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications
Thank you, Fab. Good afternoon and welcome to Allegheny Technologies' earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2007. This conference call is being broadcast live on our website at alleghenytechnologies.com and on ccbn.com. Members of the media have been invited to listen to this call.
Participating in the conference call today are Pat Hassey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Rich Harshman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. After some initial comments, we will ask for questions. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to two questions to be considered of others on the line.
Please note that all forward-looking statements made this afternoon are subject to various assumptions and caveats as noted in the earnings release. Actual results may differ materially. Here is Pat Hassey.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Dan and thanks to everyone for joining us today. With all that's been going on in the equity markets lately, this is not a time to be pessimistic. It's really not a time to be optimistic. Rather, it's a time to be realistic about the long term, intermediate and short term. During this call, we'll try to separate the fears in the equity and credit markets from the fundamentals and the drivers of ATI's business.
We see plusses and minuses. Mostly, we see plusses for ATI. So let's start with the facts of 2007. Firstly, we strengthened our position in key global markets, launched new production facilities and solidified our balance sheet. We achieved record sales and profits. Demand continued to be strong from our key diversified global markets: aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy and medical. These markets accounted for 71% of ATI's sales in 2007. Direct international sales increased 25% and reached a record of nearly $1.5 billion or approximately 27% of total sales. We believe that nearly one half of ATI's sales are driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers.
We continue to build on our foundation of unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities. Our major capital projects for titanium sponge production, melting, rolling and finishing are on track. Our titanium sponge production reached 16 million pounds annualized in 2007. We also launched new titanium and nickel-based alloy melting assets including new VARs and our new PAM III Plasma Arc Melting furnace. We remained focused on our performance and execution, resulting in gross cost reductions totaling $112 million, exceeding our 2007 gross cost reduction target of $100 million.

Finally, in a very weak stainless market, our Flat-Rolled Products segment set a record for profitability, over $500 million of segment operating profit for the year. Cash flow was strong in 2007. Cash on hand at the end of the year was $623 million. This is after investing $447 million in capital expenditures including $284 million for our strategic capital projects. We repurchased 675,000 shares of stock for approximately $61 million. Our share repurchase program only began on November 13th of last year. We made a $100 million voluntary pension contribution. We have voluntarily contributed $350 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan since 2004. The plan was approximately 111% funded at the end of the year. As a result in 2008, we expect retirement benefit expenses to be only $1 million as compared to $30 million in 2007.
The key financial metrics for the year were impressive. Stockholders equity is $2.2 billion, giving us the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. Return on stockholders equity was 40%. Return on capital employed was 31% and we had more cash than debt at the end of the year.
2007 may be remembered as a year of extreme raw material cost volatility and extraordinary inventory destocking by some distributor customers. Titanium scrap prices began the year at 18.50 per pound and fell to $9 per pound at the end of the year. And I am referring to 6/4 premium solid scrap, which is the scrap that we buy. Average LME nickel cash price in December 2006 was $15.68 per pound. The nickel price peaked in May at $23.67 a pound and then it fell to $11.79 a pound in December of 2007. This volatility resulted in never before seen customer buying patterns.
Lastly, we completed a number of new long-term agreements in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We expect total revenue from these agreements to be approximately $1.5 billion during the timeframe of the agreements. These agreements generally range from two years to five years. These LTAs cover our titanium and titanium alloy, nickel-based alloy, specialty alloy, grain-oriented electrical silicon steel and iron castings. LTAs indicate that long-term supply of these products remain critically important to our customers. We are working on significant LTAs for these and other projects as we report here in the first quarter.
Now looking ahead to 2008 and beyond, we believe ATI is well positioned to benefit from diversified global markets in 2008 and over the next several years. The long-term position of ATI and the fundamentals of our markets are outstanding. We're optimistic about 2008. Our short-term view: the first quarter is choppy.
So why do we feel this way? Let's start with the aerospace and defense markets and continue from there. We see short-term headwinds as a result of potential delays in the Boeing 787 delivery schedule. Remember, the new schedule is not precisely available. It's not a matter of if we will see strong demand from this revolutionary new plane; it's a matter of when and how strongly ATI benefits from this model as well as future composite titanium airplanes. We are pleased with our growing relationship with The Boeing Company. It is a growing relationship in titanium and value-added titanium products. It is also a growing relationship in specialty alloys as well as cutting tools. The products we supply Boeing can be used and are used on all Boeing airplane models.
The commercial airplane market is very strong. Boeing booked 1430 net orders in 2007; Airbus booked 1341 net orders last year. Both have record backlogs. Some analysts in the field say it's a six-year backlog, some say it's an eight-year backlog. Either way, both companies are boosting production. Demand is also strong from the regional jet manufacturers.

Next, each of these planes has two to four engines hanging on their wings. Our customers like GE Aviation, CFM International, Rolls-Royce announced record and strong orders in 2007. Bottom line: we expect all of this to translate into strong demand for our specialty metals for many years. By the way, strong demand from global markets and extended backlogs are happening while the U.S. fleet continues to age with few new airplanes on order. This is really another insurance policy, if you will, to continuing high build rates well into the future.
Now focusing on our titanium growth. We have new production facilities that are scheduled to be launched in 2008. These facilities build on our foundation of unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities that give ATI the most advanced technology in our industry. This gives us the capability to manufacture the most advanced specialty metals for the next generation and future generation airframes and jet engines. In addition, the lowest cost titanium units that we can get from a reliable and qualified sourced are manufactured at our own Albany, Oregon facility.
In 2008, we expect further growth in our titanium mill product shipments. We believe demand will continue to remain at a high level from the aerospace and defense market for our High Performance Metals segment titanium products. We expect titanium average selling prices in this segment to be at a lower level than in 2007, but this is primarily due to lower raw material prices and our surcharging indexes.
Demand is so strong for our flat-rolled commercial titanium products from the global industrial markets, including the chemical process industry and the oil and gas industry. Sometimes titanium sales in our Flat-Rolled Products have been or are overlooked. In 2007, shipments of titanium products from this segment and ATI-produced Uniti titanium products grew nearly 25% to approximately 10.4 million pounds. With LTAs we have in hand today, which we did not have in hand in 2007, we expect to exceed this shipment level in 2008. ATI's total shipments of titanium products from our High Performance Metals and Flat-Rolled Products segments, including conversion of our Uniti titanium joint venture, totaled over 41 million pounds in 2007. We expect this total of titanium shipments to grow to approximately 50 million pounds in 2008.
Now let's discuss the flexibility of our unsurpassed and fungible manufacturing capabilities. I like to use the word fungible. As a multi-metals producer with global sales teams, we have the ability to find and supply growth markets. In some cases, these are applications that are new to us. In this case, our ATI Asia and Uniti joint venture sales teams captured orders with a strong demand for titanium sheet used in plate frame and tubular heating... heat exchangers. We take some of our new titanium sponge, some of our titanium melt capabilities along with some raw material and semi-finished products from our Uniti joint venture partner and make high quality titanium sheets. We expect shipments into this market to be strong under multi-year LTAs that begin in 2008.
Moving to our exotic metals division. Demand is so strong from the nuclear electrical energy market and the global chemical process industry that we are now booking orders into 2009. We restarted our idle zirconium sponge capacity in 2007, some of it, and plan to add more zirconium sponge capacity in 2008 to meet this growing demand. Our non-nuclear grade zirconium products are used in processing plants that produce chemicals used in making plastics and fertilizers.
Now moving to another strong product. Demand remains very strong for our grain-oriented silicon electrical steel products. Overall, based on the LTAs that we have with several customers, we expect shipments and prices to be up in 2008. While there is some softness in the U.S. market due to the housing slowdown, global demand remained strong from the electrical energy distribution market. Also, interest in our premium light gauge products is robust as the U.S. prepares for new efficiency requirements mandated recently by the DOE.

Now turning to the short term. For the first quarter, we do see some choppiness. Our caution comes from questions about the health of the U.S. economy and the near-term aerospace supply chain. At this point, we must separate these fundamentals from fear. From our viewpoint, we do not have a negative outlook for the U.S. economy. Demand for our standard grade stainless sheet products in our Flat-Rolled Products segment is improving. After 2007's inventory destocking, it appears that U.S. service centers now have their inventories in better balance. Recovery in our stainless sheet business seems to be occurring in the U.S. and in Europe. January and February production schedules have filled and we are now loading for March.
In our High Performance Metals segment, demand from our OEM aerospace customers, particularly those under long-term agreement, is expected to remain at high level... at a high level in 2008 as airframe and jet engine backlogs are at record levels. Approximately 70% of our business here is under LTAs, some are take or pay, some are guaranteed share and some are market requirement contracts. On the other hand, our transaction or spot business, there is some risk in the first quarter as our non-OEM and service center customers are being cautious, largely due to questions about the 787 schedule, the U.S. economy and volatility in raw materials.
In summary, we remain optimistic about 2008. We expect to continue to benefit from the global infrastructure build and rebuild. We expect aerospace and defense demand to remain at a high level. We expect demand from our commercial aerospace to increase once the uncertainties surrounding the 787 schedule and supplicant [ph] ramp up are removed.
Our Flat-Rolled Products standard sheet business seems to be recovering. Inventory at distributors is relatively low. ATI's strategic capital projects are on track and we expect another year of strong cash flow.
At this point, we believe the first quarter 2008 results are likely, likely, to be similar to those achieved in the fourth quarter 2007. However, we expect to have a better understanding of the potential upside for the balance of 2008 once we get beyond this first quarter.
With that said, operator, we will now open up the meeting for questions.
Question And Answer
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Chris Olin from Cleveland Research. Please proceed.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Good afternoon.
Unidentified Company Representative
Hi Chris.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
I want to get some clarity on the titanium market here. I guess I am going to focus on the supply side. What is your total exposure to the CP titanium market? I guess I'm wondering how much exposure these operations will have once you start to see the Asian capacity boom, and I'm wondering if that's having any kind of impact on your business in terms of too much supply coming on the marketplace?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good question. Let me just tell you what's happening. As I mentioned in my previous comments, our assets and our capacities are fungible. So we have may be an announcement to make that will be very interesting to people on this call. We are the largest supplier of CP quality sheet in the world. Our Flat-Rolled Products division is the largest supplier of CP quality sheet in the world. We shipped last year, as I mentioned, 10.4 million pounds out of this unit and we expect that business to be further strengthened this year in new markets called plate frame heat exchanger and tubing that goes into power generators and exchangers that go into the nuclear chemical processing business and other markets. So when we look at that market today, we're seeing a growing presence of ATI in those markets. The demand is very high. And it's interesting to me that if there is so much capacity coming online, why we didn't have a problem booking LTAs for two or three years out in these markets.

Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Hill with Citi.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
Great. Thanks for the presentation everyone. I was just wondering if we could walk through the new LTAs that were signed in the quarter. We seemed to mention a fair number of those on the call, was everything from high performance metals to exotics et cetera in some new geographies. So could you just give us some illustrative examples of new deals that were signed up in the quarter?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We'll give you some range of the market, John. I'm not sure I want to mention customers at this point in time. But, basically, we're talking about the electrical steel business. We knew that as the U.S. market was coming into some problems that it would be good to have contracts in place. We also have a capability in our business of producing the lighter gauges in this market, which is products that produce a more efficient voltage regulation.
So as the household market, single phase market went down, we concentrated on those industrial applications and also the newer DOE requirements in not only the U.S. market, but around the world. We signed some contracts for supply of electrical steel that are new to us and maybe even some new accounts. And we have signed those up at higher prices and higher shares. So we like that. We have some billet customers, again, for the aerospace business and defense market, some forgers, we have some contracts that went into the airframe business. We have a new contract... I'll mention one... with Bombardier for some of their requirements.
Other than that, we go into some wind energy kind of contracts for the first time on hubs and stands. We have, as I mentioned, some contracts in titanium, commercial grade titanium for plateframe heat exchangers, mostly for marine applications. And we've got some precision rolled strip kind of contracts that we've put in place that are very attractive to us for such things as parts for turbo diesels for their turbocharger application.
So it's been all over the map. Interesting part is that this hasn't ended. As we ended the quarter, we're getting a lot of requests. Today, we are in negotiations for contracts in several market segments of the company today. So people... but the point I was trying to make in the earlier one, and I'll say it again is that people, as they look at the longer term and they look at... when I say longer term, talking three years kind of horizon... continue to be worried about supply and about quality supply for their products as this market rolls forward.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
That's great perspective. I was just wondering if we can do a quick follow up very, very mechanical for Rich. On the retirement expense tailwind, I guess, for 2008, is that decline of $29.3 million in retirement benefit expense, is that the whole number or should we also be including the pension line from down below which adds another $30 million or so?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
No, that's all [ph] number John. We talk about retirement benefit expense and that two pieces, that's pension expense, and actually, in this case in 2008, the pension expense will be an income and then it's also retirement benefit expense under our OPEB programs. That will be an expense and the net amount is a $1 million expense this year in '08 versus a $30 million expense in 2007.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
But the net benefit from '07 to '08 is the 29.3?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
Pulling both pieces together.

Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup

Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.
Unidentified Analyst
Hello.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hello.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Karan [ph] in from [indiscernible] Research. A couple of questions in this challenging quarter for you Pat. Regarding your private plan [ph], a lot of your different plants are producing your steel, what are your operational improvement initiatives in terms of lean manufacturing, TPM, Six Sigma and how do you see those initiatives benefiting the organization?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the basic initiatives run within our movement toward the Toyota Production System in what we call the ATI Business System. And reliability maintenance has been a major move for us where we have more of a change in our organization, a change in our approach to a reliability centered maintenance, which works on the effectiveness as well as the uptime and yield of our production centers. We've had some tremendous productivity improvements on the same equipment. A good example I can give you is that I think the numbers today are that we are probably up 20% with existing equipment in our electrical steel business. We are up in our melting furnaces down in the Allvac operation. So we continue to move on the premise that people connect the system that our workers are the experts in the manufacturing side of the business, our process and engineers are experts in the process. Put all those people together, put some capital behind them and working together. We are producing some very nice results in productivity across the company.
Unidentified Analyst
And a follow up to that question. What metrics are you guys using to manage the manufacturing processes? A lot of companies similar to yours are using like OE and RONA. How important are those types of metrics to you? And as we go forward for the remainder of the year, what do you see as the challenges to improve on throughput and costs within your plants?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we are looking at, again, another $100 million cost re program [ph] on the aggregate. And we look at the metrics of yield, we look at the metrics, first of all, from the quality side, look at our yield, we look at our returns, we look at the effective OEE measurements from the production, but we are also looking at production bottlenecks where we debottleneck on the basis of a flow path rather than PC by PC. So we have different looks around that. We have a new union contract that was put in place and continues in place under the recently early signed agreement and we look to utilize our people better and we have areas where we are seeing some attrition... planned attrition and the rest of the workforce stepping up to what we have in the more flexible work assignments. So we look at productivity, we look at yield, we look at our operational excellence, we'll just call it that. And then we look at flow paths in terms of their total productivity. And we have moved into practices that simplify flow paths that align products to a simplified direct flow path, working on the bottleneck rather than the flexibility of moving those across the systems. We found that to be very effective too.

Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Yes, just for the record guys, that was not me; I don't know who that was.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Gautam.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company

No problem. I guess one of the questions I have is you had very strong margins in the High Performance segment this quarter, yet titanium pricing ASPs were down, shipments weren't up that much sequentially. Sort of what should we expect heading into 2008 in terms of High Performance margins given the lower ASPs and what do you expect kind of the ASPs to shake out at on the titanium side?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well we don't report exactly what our titanium margins are, but as a segment --
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Fair enough.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We put it all together. And I think we are seeing some short-term volume issues as the 787 program gets reshuffled for the third time. And so we are seeing that and we are also seeing, from a spot market standpoint, a pretty competitive market on that 30% of our volume that we booked. Our target remains to stay north of 30%, 30% or north in total in the High Performance area. We had a very good high shipping quarter in our exotic metals, which had some impact, but not a huge impact with some impact in the fourth quarter. And we see those margins continuing to be very, very strong. We see our margins basically in our long-term agreements remain fairly stable. And then we see more a competitive environment as the stability of supply at fairly high levels meets demand, at least until the 787 program launches and ramps. Then I think we'll see some higher margins as those... that other 30% of the business starts to get tighter than what it is today.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
I guess what I was trying to get at it is despite those market conditions which you endured in the fourth quarter, you still had very strong margins at High Performance. So to the extent that things don't get appreciably worse, should we look at north of 35% as reasonable entering 2008? Or because there was a big LIFO adjustment that you trued up in one quarter, we should actually think if the true margins, if you will, in Q4 as closer to the 30% ex the LIFO impact, and assuming that market conditions don't change much from Q4 to Q1, we should be modeling Q1 probably closer to the 30% range?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think that's a good. We've said 30, 30% plus. I don't know if we want to say more than that. We had margins that were certainly... we still had the problems of the higher cost material from a FIFO standpoint and we did get relief on that with the LIFO reserves coming back in. So that quarter, when you balance everything out, I think is a pretty true quarter. I think as we move into the fourth quarter, what I had said earlier is that we'll see some margin pressure on the 30% of our business that's not under contract. So that may push them down from the 36% to a lower number. I don't think you should go higher than that. But I would say that the 30% margins plus is what we're targeting. Rich, do you want to add anything to that?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
No, I... Gautam, I think that... I think your point about the fourth quarter and the LIFO impact, especially in the High Performance Metals segment in the fourth quarter, because it is a true up to year end, there probably was more of a LIFO benefit that more than offset the FIFO margin compression there. Now when you look at, especially in the titanium side, the manufacturing process we have given the product mix is long. And I think we're still likely to see some FIFO margin compression in Q1 as we work through the higher cost raw material that's being matched up against a much lower index. And we would not expect at this point that to be offset by any LIFO benefit in Q1. So I think it's a combination of many things including in Q1 our expectation at this point that volumes on the spot business side might be a little lower because of the ongoing caution in the supply chain because of the issues that Pat talked about regarding 787.

Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Okay. And so, just to conclude on that point, we basically have in Q1 ASPs working against us, we have a little bit lighter volume because there is softness in the spot market and you have... you don't have the one quarter true up of the LIFO adjustment relative to your expectations. And so it would not be absurd to go to closer to 30% versus 35?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I would agree with that, and then just add one other thing when we see a stronger Flat-Rolled side.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Right. And that's the second part of the question and then I'll kick it to other people. But you had guided previously directionally 15 to 20% in Flat-Rolled over time and we are at 8.5% in Q4. Kind of what's the shape of that recovery and do you get to 15% by Q2 or when do we see that again?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I think that the year was 17.5, 17.4 for the total year. And I think as we get to any kind of a normal level in the standard side of the business, we are back in that 15% range. 15 and higher, yes.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
15 and higher. So maybe we'd get to 15 over the course of the year on average, but probably not much beyond that given kind of our visibility today.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This thing is going to move up from the fourth quarter level. So we don't... we won't expect to have our best quarter of the year in the first quarter. So it's going to ramp up, but better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. Averaging, I won't change that number, I think for the year we averaged 15 to 20%.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Okay, thank you very much guys. I appreciate it.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto from Bear Stearns.
Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
Thank you very much. Hi Pat and everyone.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Tony.
Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
Just a couple of questions here too. My margin questions have been asked, and thank you for that insight. Did I hear you correctly? Did I hear you say the 50 million pounds of the titanium product volume in '08 you are kind of holding to that, that was kind of in line with your previous guidance? Is that what I heard? Did I hear it correctly?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
You did. It's still with the High Performance side plus growing Flat-Rolled side. We had the 41... actually, 41.1 last year and we're looking for 50 million pounds this year. It's in the three categories: High Performance, which is aerospace and defense; our commercial products from direct business and our Flat-Rolled side and our Uniti joint venture, direct and conversion business there.
Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
Okay. So in total about --
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
50. Yes, 50 --
Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
20% roughly. And then the other question was in regards to your free cash flow, and I was very happy to see you buy back some stock in the quarter, should we assume when you look at other uses of that free cash flow, given where your stock is now, should we assume that that's probably a pretty attractive area for that excess cash, if you will? Or should we also maybe think about with equity valuations coming down and your strong balance sheet, might acquisitions move up a little bit in terms of that relative attractiveness?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We don't... we certainly don't remove anything from the horizon. I think that we have a balanced approach to our cash with some aggressive capital program for organic growth that really will position this company as we move forward with the capabilities; not just capacities, capabilities for the sizes and products that we need to have to compete in this world as we go forward. We're really in a great position to put these assets in place and we're doing that with the majority of the cash this year. We also have the opportunity with... certainly, with what's in the market today, to be a very value-based buyer in buying our stock back. So we have those two things. And of course when we look at valuations across and outside of the company with this strong balance sheet, it opens up the door for us to do things if in fact they look like they are the right strategic move for the company at the right time.

Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
All right, Pat. And my first, obviously, question wasn't really a question, but if I could ask one more maybe just to pursue Engineered Products a little bit. It was disappointing in our eyes and I'm sure in your eyes too. But when should we expect that the ramp up, the combined ramp up of... you've got good end market demand, it seems like, but the raw material side has continued to be a bugaboo. How do you see that proceeding as we move into 2008 here?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I feel like a broken record on this one, but it's this quarter. We should see that business back in shape and back into a normal profitability this quarter.
Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
Okay. By normal profitability, what do you mean by that? If you could maybe use a similar vernacular to the way you described for us the margins?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We are looking about a 12 to 15% business. That's what we want there.
Anthony Rizzuto, Jr - Bear Stearns
Okay. Thanks very much, Pat.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tony.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella from JP Morgan.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
Yes, good afternoon Pat and Rich.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Mike.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Hi Mike.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
Two questions. One, when you gave your guidance for the first quarter being basically flat with the fourth quarter, are you referring to EPS of $1.45?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We are referring to EPS, yes.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
And what is your underlying assumption then for LIFO, the total LIFO in that guidance for the first quarter?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Zero.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
Okay. So you had a fairly sizable benefit in the fourth quarter and you are assuming that the EPS is still going to stay the same without that benefit in the first quarter.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Exactly. Remember, in the fourth quarter... third quarter and the fourth quarter, the reason I tried to point out these dramatic swings in our starting raw materials is that in our business, as we are moving some of these longer lead time items through, the third quarter was dramatically affected by nickel on the Flat-Rolled side and the fourth quarter was dramatically affected by titanium scrap prices in the High Performance side. Fortunately, under the accounting that we had in LIFO accounting, we have the ability to mitigate that with the LIFO reserves. And as Rich pointed out, I think we've basically offset all of that in the fourth quarter. So Mike, your point that the... if you want to call it this way that the first quarter without LIFO was a much cleaner quarter to look at margins and earnings. We are saying it's similar to the fourth quarter overall, but maybe one that you can get a fairly better viewpoint of an improving margin base, yes.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
The LIFO in the fourth quarter was about $73.5 million?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Right.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
And then, so if you tax effect that, you are looking on an EPS basis you are about $0.46?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, that's right Mike.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
So you really look... pre-LIFO, you are looking at $0.99 in the fourth going to somewhere around a $1.45 on an equivalent basis in the first. So even with all this noise going on and concerns and everything, you are still looking at a pretty substantial up quarter sequentially from fourth to first?

L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And we get rid of the... we have some lagging bufferstop... bufferstock type material that has to get out of the way. But we are basically saying that the negative effect of higher metal prices and higher in-process inventories and lower selling prices due to the surchargers are now taken care of and the margins that we see are margins that we have built into these businesses.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
Okay.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And then if you want to take the LIFO completely out of the equation, what your... you're math is right.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
All right. And then last question. What is your lockout period for doing your share buyback program? When can you next go into the market and buy shares?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Mike, this is Rich. Our view is that it's just today.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
It's just today.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
So tomorrow, you could be in buying shares?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
We could.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
So, I mean, not to put words into your mouth, but with the stock down almost 50% since October, are you viewing the share buyback as one of your primary near-term uses of cash?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Well, as Pat said, we have a balanced view of cash usage, but we bought 675,000 shares back in the fourth quarter at an average price of $90.72. And we thought that that was a good buy, so you can make your own conclusion.
Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan
All right, Rich. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert LaGaipa from Oppenheimer.
Bob LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.
Hi, good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Bob.
Bob LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.
I just wanted to follow up on the last question of the sequential change in terms of the EPS about being the same. What other puts and takes should we take from that? I mean you mentioned the High Performance, you mentioned Flat-Rolled getting better, you are going to get the benefit of the lower retirement expense as well, which is obviously going to help out. I mean what type of tax rate are you using in your forecast for 2008?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Bob, at this point, we're using 36.5% as the normalized tax rate.
Bob LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.
36.5%. Now that's actually... that's a little bit higher than what you've been running at the last couple of quarters. I mean is that just assuming that you are not going to get some of these tax benefits and what's the likelihood of additional tax benefits?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Well, we don't have... most of the tax benefits that we realized in 2007 were the reversal of various valuation allowances that we had on state tax NOL credit carryforwards because of changed circumstances that we... under the application of GAAP. We have some opportunity perhaps for some items in 2008, but that would be based upon a specific facts and circumstances evaluation every quarter. So I mean at this point, the only thing that we are thinking of is a more normalized tax rate of 36.5%.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
You don't think it will be higher?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer

No... well, I don't think it will be higher.
Bob LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.
Okay, terrific. And last question if I could, just on the volumes in the Flat-Rolled business. Obviously, they have been coming down for most of the year, kicked back up here. You mentioned the inventory seemed to be under control, or the order activity has picked up in the last several weeks. What kind of volumes are you expecting in the first quarter and what kind of ramp can we assume for the remainder of the year?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, what we've said is that our targeted volumes are between... around 350,000 tons and we expect to meet that rate in the first quarter.
Bob LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.
Okay, terrific. Thanks very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Carroll from Davenport & Company.
Lloyd O'Carroll - Davenport Equity Research
Circling back to Flat-Rolled, if I look at profitability on an operating profit per pound, which I think is better than percent margin, there was a $0.30 drop from Q3 to Q4. Was there anything unusual in terms of LIFO that would account for a very depressed number in Q4?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Let Rich take that, go ahead.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Not really, Lloyd. If you look at the Q3 in the Flat-Rolled Products segment, we had an $18 million benefit and in Q4, we had a $14 million benefit. I think the real issue was the significantly lower operating volume that we had in the second half of the third quarter that translated into higher per unit cost of much of the product that we shipped in the fourth quarter.
Lloyd O'Carroll - Davenport Equity Research
Okay. So, as volume bounces back to service centers and other commodity customers, then unit margins, however you measure it, should be rebounding on some schedule. Great. Okay, thank you.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Lloyd.

Good afternoon Pat.

Good afternoon.

Just one question on electrical steel, if you can give us some color on the electrical steel you make. Is it all grain-oriented or do you make both grain non-oriented, grain-oriented, what's the percentage?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We make all grain-oriented electrical steel. All of ours is grain-oriented. It's a product that we've made for many years, it's a high quality product. We specialized in some of the lighter gauges that are shipped in that product that give better voltage regulation. And we have a worldwide market today. We are shipping one out of four pounds outside the U.S., and we are shipping 90% of our products under LTAs that have been signed and are locked.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Are these LTAs repriced every year?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
They're repriced this year and they're take or pay.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
I see. And do you... did you get... I mean, one of your competitors yesterday mentioned that they got a 20% price increase, more than 20%. Was this similar in your case?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well we don't usually talk about that, but we would think that's a conservative price increase.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
And what kind of volume do you produce on electrical steel?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
120,000 tons.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
And that's in your high value-added Flat-Rolled?

L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It is in our higher value-added schedule now, yes. Part of the high value in Flat-Rolled, yes.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Luke Folta from Longbow Research.
Luke Folta - Longbow Research
Hey, good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Luke.
Luke Folta - Longbow Research
Hi. I wanted to drill a little bit more on the... maybe can you talk about what you're seeing from your customers in the commercial aerospace supply chain regarding their inventory levels and what you've been seeing as far as order rates are concerned over the last couple of weeks?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I would say this that the order levels at the direct customers seem to be in line with their production and their increasing build rates moving into 2008, up 5 to 10% on existing models. I think what we are seeing is people buying for the needs that they have in the general distribution business, in the specialty side of this. I think there is caution from that part of the business in terms of how fast do you put in materials. They are putting in materials that they need, but are cautious about building inventories for the higher build rates. Our own feeling is that the 787 program and its qualification will debottleneck that whole side of the business. So today, we operate with about 70% under contract and 30% from the market that you are asking us. About the best description I get today is that the order entry is busier and more active and there is a lot bubbling up, whatever that means.
Luke Folta - Longbow Research
Okay. And just on a side issue, since last time you had your call, one of your competitors, TIMET, decided not to go ahead with their sponge capacity expansion. And I just was wondering if you could maybe comment on what you think the implications are there for the industry and kind of your overall take on that decision.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, at the same time, that corresponded to a contract with an outside supplier from Japan. And so I think that was probably a move that was calculated by them as to make or buy, and they decided to buy at the best outlet. One of the things that we said all along is that building a state-of-the-art new sponge plant is not an easy undertaking in the United States with air permits, building permits, the technology of doing this and supply and engineering expertise. So all those things combined, you will have to TIMET what their decision was. But our plant is up and the buildings are coming up, the engineering is on track. It's been a... it's a big project, but we are very, very pleased and proud of the people that are running it. It's really quite a site out in Rowley, Utah right now. And we expect that one to be just as good as bringing up our Albany, Oregon plant, which is up and humming very, very well for us. As I said, it's the best source of metal units that we can find today at the best value, at the lowest cost to make it ourselves.
Luke Folta - Longbow Research
You said you are at 16 million pounds annual production now?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We annualized last year at 16 million pounds. We expect that will be 20 million pounds in 2008.
Luke Folta - Longbow Research
Great. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Hayes.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc.

Hi, good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good afternoon Timothy.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc.
Just to clarify on the LIFO, I know in Q4, there can true ups. Can you quantify for the two segments what, if any, true-ups occurred in those LIFO gains?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Well the easier one is the Flat-Rolled Products segment, because if you go back and look and see where we were booked on LIFO in each segment as of the end of the third quarter, that would have suggested that we would have had a $5 million LIFO benefit in Q4 and in... or a provision, I'm sorry, in Flat-Rolled Products, and we had a $14 million benefit. So that was a $19 million swing there. And most of that had to do with liquidation of inventory as we focused on quite frankly getting our inventory quantities better in line. The High Performance Metals segment was probably the bigger benefit there. We were booked at roughly a $35 million benefit through the third quarter. So that would have suggested that we would have had roughly an $11 million benefit in the fourth quarter and instead we had a $61 million benefit. So there was a $50 million benefit in the fourth quarter, largely due to a continued, rapid decline in the cost of titanium scrap from in the neighborhood of 12 to $13 a pound in the third quarter down to around $9 a pound in the fourth quarter.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc.
Okay. So then just make sure I've got the numbers right, so a true up of $19 million for Flat-Rolled and $50 million for High Performance?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc.
Okay, thank you.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer

Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hello.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Can you hear me?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we can.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Okay, terrific. Just to follow up on your titanium assumptions in '08. You mentioned 50 million pounds. Kind of what are your assumptions with respect to the 87 program? When does it... does it pull the same amount of metal as you're anticipating on the Q3 call? And secondly, kind of how does that Boeing agreement work so that if they... is there kind of a minimum they have to buy, a maximum and then a level at which if they order more in a given period, whether it be a month, a quarter, or what have you, the profitability improves on those incremental units? And so kind of what's the sensitivity around a delay, a further delay?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well we have a minimum take or pay quantity in this contract. We have a nominal targeted quantity and then we have a search quantity. What you're referring to in the search quantity is that that has some pricing formula to it that may be different than the guaranteed or nominal plus 25%. We have some ranges there. So when we look at that contract, I would just say this that in 2008, remember, again, all this metal that we are supplying the Boeing corporation is fungible to Boeing into all of their airplane programs. They can use this titanium from the 737 through the 747. So the 777 to us would be... they're buying for the ramp up of that program, but they're also... this metal at least is fungible across their system. Our projections and understanding for Boeing is that we will have a better year with Boeing in 2008 than we had in 2007. And so once we get to that point in time, I would say that until this, and this is our view of life from ATI, until this program powers on, until it gets up for its first test flight and we have a more precise schedule as to the build rates and when it ramps, the surge that we're looking for is going to occur subsequent to those events.

Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Okay. I guess what I'm wondering is Rich had mentioned in prior calls that you're looking for a 25% uptick in shipments '08 and '09 mill product titanium. Right now, you're talking a little under 25%, going from 41 to 50. Presumably, there is uncertainty on the 87 that's sort of driving the variability there. And it sounds like the mix is shifting more to industrial markets. The net effect of all this, I'm wondering is, is there a risk that if indeed the 87 is delayed, call it, six weeks more, the fact that you're not in that surge bonus round, or what have you, of the shipments where profitability presumably is better that High Performance margins kind of stay at that 30% throughout the year as opposed to, what's implied at 32.5 or so?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I would say this. I would say we have a bigger risk on margins staying in the range that you just described from the 30% of our business that is spot business and is competitive in the marketplace without the surge in the airframe programs. I think our margins under our LTAs are pretty well locked in for us and we expect to see those. The competitive part of the business comes in the serendipitous spot business, and now [ph] those markets, defense markets, medical markets and general distribution for titanium products, where you don't have the... where you have a very balanced situation be it at high levels between demand and supply right now. So that's where there is more price competition. And I think that turns the corner when we see what I'll call a surge in orders from the ramp up of these new airplane programs, both the 380 and the 787.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Okay. And lastly, could you guide us on what you think ASPs are going to average out at on titanium mill next year, '08?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I'd rather not guide on that. Thank you.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company
Thanks a lot guys.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2008 Allegheny Technologies Earnings conference Call. My name is Heather and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Dan Greenfield, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Dan L. Greenfield - Investor Relations
Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon, and welcome to Allegheny Technologies earnings conference call for the first quarter 2008. This conference call is being broadcast live on our website at alleghenytechnologies.com and on ccbn.com. Members of the media have been invited to listen to this call. Participating in the conference call today are Pat Hassey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Harshman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
After some initial comments, we will ask for questions. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to two questions to be considerate of others on the line.
Please note that all forward-looking statements made this afternoon are subject to various assumptions and caveats as noted in the earnings release. Actual results may differ materially.
Here is Pat Hassey.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We said the first quarter of 2008 would be similar to our fourth quarter 2007 performance, and it was. We also expected first quarter results to be negatively impacted by raw material costs being higher than the indices and surcharges used to determine selling prices. This is a timing issue, and it did indeed impact our first quarter results both in High Performance Metals and in Flat-Rolled products. So, here's our view.
High performance Metals segment operating profit was below our minimum target of 30%. This was primarily due to two things; first, the timing mismatch between raw material cost and selling price indices; and second, lower nickel-based alloy volumes and a more competitive marketplace. We saw some of our customers, particularly distributors, taking inventory management actions. We believe inventories at these customers are now fairly lean. In contrast, shipments of our nickel-based alloys to jet engine OEM customers remained solid. We expect our High performance Metal operating margins to hover in the high-20s until there is more conviction on the aerospace build schedules. Nickel alloy volumes continued to improve compared to the first quarter. We expect titanium volumes to remain at high levels, and our exotic alloys business is doing very well due to strong demand from the chemical process sector as well as growing demand from the nuclear energy market.
In the Flat-Rolled Products segment, operating profit was 13.5% of sales. This improvement of 500 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. But operating profit fell below our minimum target of 15%. We believe conditions now exist for our Flat-Rolled Products segment operating margins to recover to approximately 15% in the second quarter.

Engineered Products operating profit in the first quarter was again unacceptable. Operating performance in our forged products business and startup expense of our casting business at our new Alpena, Michigan facility, which is aimed at significant growth in the wind energy business, negatively impacted this segment's results. We're working hard to get Engineered Products’ operating margins back to about 10%. Our APT plant is working well and the operating issues encountered during the startup have been resolved. In fact, based on the current availability and price of APT, we believe being fully integrated in APT is the right strategy for this business.
Considering the uncertainties in the U.S. economy and in the aerospace supply chain, first quarter results reflect positively on the strength of ATI earnings and what we consider to be the bottom of the current market. Direct International sales reached 28% of total sales. We believe that more than 50% of our sales are driven by demand from non-U.S. markets. Our key growth products continued double-digit growth rates compared to the first quarter of 2007. Titanium product shipments increased 26% under ATI's diversified global market strategy. Exotic alloy shipments grew by 38%. Grain-oriented electrical steel shipments grew by 15%.
Our key financial metrics speak for themselves. Return on capital employed was over 27%. Return on stockholders’ equity was nearly 35%. Net debt to total capitalization was 2.4%.
We have a strong balance sheet. We had $468 million of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter after we made significant investments in the business; $149 million in managed working capital, mostly due to the recovery in our Flat-Rolled Products business; $112 million of new capital investment and we spent $62 million to repurchase 887,000 shares of ATI stock. As we have stated, we have a balanced view of our use of cash. Our primary focus continues to be on investing for profitable growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're also focused on creating value for our shareholders through our dividend policy and our share repurchase program. Finally, we are committed to performance and execution. In the first quarter, we achieved gross cost reductions of $32 million, again ahead of target.
Let's move to our aerospace business. This is an unprecedented global aerospace cycle. Our aircraft and jet engine customers report record backlogs, over 7,000 large aircrafts on order. Their order rates had exceeded the build rates so far in 2008, and production schedules for existing models are increasing. The bulk of this backlog is for non-U.S. based airlines. The aging fleet is finally catching up with the legacy U.S. carriers. As these old planes get older, they are likely to have more and more maintenance issues. The chaos of domestic air travel that we have seen recently is further evidenced that the U.S. fleet must be replaced sooner rather than later. Note last week, American Airlines announced that it is accelerating replacement of its old fleet with new Boeing 737-800s. According to American Airlines, these new planes are expected to deliver 25% better fuel economy and better reliability than the MD-80s being replaced.
To expand our presence in the aerospace market, we have formed ATI Aerospace, a market sector team designed to bring the full breadth of our capabilities to jet engine and airframe customers. For jet engine customers, we're at the forefront in developing advanced specialty metals for the next generation and future generation of jet engines. For airframe customers… and remember, airframe is a relatively new market for us. We started by supplying only titanium products. Now, we're growing our supply of specialty alloys, tungsten materials, and cutting tools for difficult-to-machine specialty metals. No other company can offer customers such a span of specialty mill products and cutting tool technologies. Through ATI Aerospace, we're improving our position at existing customers while diversifying our customer and product base. We have the right products and the right tools to continue to form collaborative partnerships with strategic customers.

The recently revised schedule for the 787 Dreamliner brings near-term uncertainty to the supply chain. Boeing has told us that they intend to honor our supply agreement. Remember, our titanium products can be used on every Boeing airframe. We intend to continue to navigate through the near-term and continue our focus on diversified mill product capabilities and on the diversified global markets that we serve.
In titanium, we got off to a good start in 2008. This resulted from a high level of demand from the aerospace and defense market as well as growth in our penetration into the industrial titanium markets. We're on track to reach our 2008 target to ship approximately 50 million pounds of titanium this year.
In our Flat-Roll products segment, we have a lot of upside. Let's review this. Grain-oriented electrical steel shipments grew 15% compared to the same period last year. Even with the U.S. housing slowdown, demand remained strong for replacement residential transformers and for non-residential transformers. Demand also remained strong for the International markets. Nearly 25% of sales for this product were to customers outside the U.S. We expect demand from this market to continue to be strong going forward.
Our CP titanium sheet business continues to grow. These are differentiated titanium products, necessary for the global chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets. We have a good understanding of these markets and good visibility through our ATI International sales offices and through our Unity Titanium joint venture.
Shipments of our specialty sheet and specialty plate products decreased compared to the same period last year due to the normal choppiness of capital projects. However, we're now seeing strong demand for specialty sheet and specialty plate products from the oil and gas and electrical energy markets and we expect shipments to increase in the second quarter.
Shipments of our Precision Rolled Strip products were soft in the first quarter due to the U.S. automotive and housing markets. We expect shipments to improve in the second quarter as a result of expanded International sales and improved shipments to aerospace and defense customers. Standard sheet product shipments recovered to approximately 85,000 tons in the first quarter, which when annualized is our targeted 300,000 to 350,000-ton range.
Now just a few comments about this. Industry service center inventory data was in the 3.1 to 3.3-month supply in range during the first quarter, which is low by historical standards. This indicates that the U.S. inventory destocking is over, but restocking has not yet begun. Our shipments continue to improve. Shipments of our stainless sheet to International markets recovered to a high level. We expect our improving penetration of International markets with these products to continue. We expect base selling prices for our standard sheet to be flat to improving. This includes the recent price increase for products shipped from ready coil inventories.
We continue our investments to give us unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities. These investments enable profitable growth and build new capabilities for our diversified products in a diversified global market. We're launching new production facilities in 2008. These facilities build on our foundation that gives ATI the most advanced technology in our industry. We're building the right equipment and the right technology to maintain our leadership position in advanced specialty metals.
Our titanium sponge facility in Albany, Oregon is now producing at an annualized rate of 22 million pounds, which is ahead of schedule. Our titanium sponge facility in Rowley, Utah is on schedule and we expect to begin initial production in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our upgraded and expanded specialty and titanium plate facility in Washington, Pennsylvania is nearly ready for its second quarter 2008 launch. And lastly, we began producing and qualifying wind energy components at our new casting facility in Alpena, Michigan in April.

Our key growth markets, aerospace and defense, chemical processing, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical remains solid. These markets represent 70% of our sales. ATI is well positioned to benefit from an extended commercial aerospace and defense cycle, which is in its early stages. ATI is focused on the global infrastructure build and rebuild. Developed and developing countries need more oil and gas and electrical energy, more fertilizers, more food production and clean water. ATI's products help enable sustainability through these systems that lead to greater environmentally sound energy production and improved energy efficiency. ATI is investing for profitable growth and creating a technology platform on which to build for the future.
Our long-term outlook is positive. We believe the first quarter 2008 earnings represents the bottom. $1.40 per share in the first quarter demonstrates ATI's ability to achieve stable earnings under difficult conditions. Looking forward, base selling prices are generally flat to higher, volumes continue to improve, raw material surcharges and indices are in better balance. We expect our second quarter earnings to be somewhat higher than the first quarter results, and we expect to do better going forward.
With that brief explanation, operator, may we have the first question?
Dan L. Greenfield - Investor Relations
Heather?
Operator
Hello?
Dan L. Greenfield - Investor Relations
Yes. Can we go to the question-and-answer period, please?
Question and Answer
Operator
Sure. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Hill with Citi. Please proceed.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
Great, and thanks for the call, everyone. Just a quick question to revisit this Boeing and titanium situation, I mean it's great if they take their volumes in '08, but it creates a question about an overhang in '09. If you had to redirect those mill products elsewhere in your customer base, could you sell them? Would have to cut volumes? And would you make more money or less money if you could redirect those volumes elsewhere?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
John, where we are... let's just back up for a second and remember that we expect to ship the volumes that we had in our schedules during 2008 to Boeing. Also, when we talk about Boeing honoring their contracts, we have multi-year contracts, which include a minimum target and a maximum level. So when we talk about their honoring their contracts, we are talking about honoring the contracts straight through this contract period. So that's the first point, and there are significant volumes in that contract that are take or pay volumes that will be shipped under any circumstances. That's the first point.
Secondly, we're reaching… we're running at a rate of 50 million pounds this year. We had over 12 million pounds this shipment… 12.2 million pounds of titanium shipments in the first quarter. We began to redirect some of those volumes as to grow to that 50 million pound level really in the second half of 2007. So we are directing our shipments into more of the marine market, into the tubing markets, into the nuclear markets, into the chemical processing industry to create that growth that we have committed to at the 50 million pounds. I think we're able to reach that growth this year and sustain that level throughout the future. I think it will take the ramp-up of the new airplane programs, both the 787 and the 380, to get us to that next plateau of around 60 million pounds. So we're very confident that we are going to reach the 50 million pound level. We are gearing for that level. We are stretching into the international markets for the titanium products that we have, generating fairly good margins on all of these products, and we're looking forward to the growth into the new aerospace platforms as the production begins to ramp-up.

John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
Great perspective. And then briefly, could you just provide us a little bit more comfort as to why it's believed that the mismatch between input costs and surcharges, particularly titanium scrap, that that's a situation that will be mitigated in the second quarter?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we're looking at… we're into the second quarter now. So we know what the prices are in the market right now and they may move a quarter, $0.50, something like that, but what… the bookings that we have and what we see in this market we don't think that scrap prices are going to go into any type of a freefall or a tumble. So as we look at the quarter we have, John, our titanium lead times are around 24 weeks. So, when we look at that we pretty much know what we're doing in the second quarter, we pretty much know what it's priced at, and hopefully we will have a good handle around this impact of lingering metal in the system that we had purchased or scrap that we had committed to that hit us in the first quarter that will not have the same impact on us into the second quarter.
John Hill - Smith Barney Citigroup
Great answer. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan
Yes, good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Michael.
Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan
Hi. I have a question. How much material have you already shipped to the Dreamliner in terms like on the… titanium frames that you supply to the Dreamliner, how many of those… the material for... how many units are already out there in the system?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It is a good speculative question, as you know. We are one of three major suppliers. So we know what we shipped. Our volumes started back in 2006 were higher in 2007, were higher in 2008. Now that's because they were at a 100% delivered performance and a 100% quality, meet all of our commitments, and they can get the metal from whatever form or shape that they want it in. If somebody else isn’t shipping, I don't know. I have said before that I thought there was at least around 35 ship sets at in this system. So I am going to say… I am going to… this is Pat Hassey relatively giving you a guess, okay, Michael. 35 to 50 ship sets, some place out there, some place in the system, some suppliers having more than others… having ordered more than others. But basically, these ship sets are at the built rate that I think meets Boeing’s extended delivery with some, let's call it, shock absorber capability in their logistics supply or TMX to move those tonnages around to other airplane programs. It's all fungible between commercial and military, and it's all products that can be used on any Boeing airframe. So, when you look at the total picture it gets complex to try to figure out from one supplier exactly where they are going to sit versus another supplier. But I think it's reasonable to assume that Boeing is going to meet its commitment they’ve set to their supplier base. I got a personal call that we will on honor our contracts, we were taking the metal that we've talked to you about, and we are going to work through this together.
Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan
I mean, can you say when the… when was the last time you shipped, specifically materials, to the Dreamliner project?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We can't tell you whether we shipped material to the Dreamliner, a 747 or a 777 unless we’re making a particular shape that we know is 100% dedicated to that particular airplane program. But I can tell you that we were making shipments to the Boeing Corporation straight to the last days of the first quarter.

Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan
Sure. Okay. Thanks a lot, Pat.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
Hello. You made a comment about Boeing honoring their commitments, and when you say that do you mean the minimum commitment in '09?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think it's honoring their contracts. This program has never rammed to what we would consider target level of shipments under our normal production schedule. So, when we talk about minimums in our contract, we're within grasp of those minimums in double digit maybe… numbers either direction, not more than 20% either way from the minimums.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
Okay. And if I recall on your last conference call, you made a comment that when the ramp really picked up on 87, it could create a tightening of the supply shortage, if you will, that would drive prices in the marginal market, the spot markets. Is the opposite true now that we have had some slack in the system, a one-year push out till full rate on the 87, should we expect further erosion? And if so, when does it appear? And did it appear in Q1? Is that what we are seeing or is there yet some erosion to come?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you noticed, in our Q1 our shipments were up, I think 26% was the number. So, we certainly didn't see any erosion. In total we shipped almost 12.5 million pounds of titanium products out of this business.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
For the pricing erosion?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Pricing erosion, if you're talking about the margin compression, hits us hard when we have higher priced raw materials going into a pricing index that sells it for less money. So, if we have higher priced material running through our flow times and selling it for the current indices at the current pricing levels, the margin contraction comes from the raw material mismatch. I’ve tried to make that clear.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
I understand that. I guess that --.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
There is no margin contraction in our contracted volumes, it's our own problems of--.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
Correct.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Mismatch is there. So getting back to your full question, I don't think we're going to see a contraction. I don't think that's the right answer. I think what we're going to see now is a more gradual increase to this build rate than what I had talked about earlier when we saw the original schedules of second revision from Boeing versus the latest revision and ramp. Now we see a much more gradual ramp, which I'll call much more traditional to the Boeing ramp up of programs versus stepping this up from shipping 12 airplanes to trying to get to a rate of shipping 80 or 90 airplanes the next year. This is going to be a much more gradual ramp, but you take the same result and spread it across, say, 18 to 24 months versus six months.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
I understand. I guess what I'm trying to reconcile are a couple of conflicting comments. One comment is, on the last earnings call you mentioned that the 30% of business in titanium that is not under contract could be the swing item if indeed the 787 ramp as projected. There’s been a slip since that last call, a material slip, especially in terms of getting to full rate, let alone first delivery. Isn't the opposite true, namely pricing on those 30% sales that are not contracted under firm-based pricing could erode and if so is that why you are guiding to high-20s margins at high performance? When are we going to start to see the drop-off in titanium spot pricing show up in your results beyond what they have already shown because we have already seeing pricing come over… it has declined 5% in this quarter, in the Q1? I don't know if that is mix dependent, if you have more ingot versus mill or what have you. But if you can work us through kind of the quarrel area of the argument you presented on Q4, which was the 30% of business not under contract has pricing leverage if the 787 ramps as planned. We know that that's not happening. So when is this going to show up in pricing and margins?

L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's not happening in a steep ramp, but the volume of that airplane program as it continues to improve, whether it is the normal build rates of them making more total aircraft going from 450 planes to 475 or 480 planes to over 500 in 2009 and a corollary to that with the Airbus programs ramping slightly higher than the Boeing programs. So we have another 20% of material going into those programs that are not as high as usage as the 787, but each of those airplanes uses some titanium, later models more than other models. So it is more of a gradual move.
The second factor that we have is that as titanium is more available to your point, we would suspect that we will see moderation in the spot market business. The question of that just simply gets back to exactly what product form will the demand be in. If we are talking about products that are going into, let's say, the heat exchanger or tubing markets, I don't see much pricing pressure coming into those markets, which are two large segments for us. If we are talking about more commodity type of products that might be going into some less stringent applications, I would agree with you that we could see some pricing degradation. But overall, I think that when we talk about staying around the high-20s, that's where we are going to be in that area until we start to see this gradual ramp of the new airplane programs pushing the supply base tighter, and as that tightens up we are going to see this spot prices rise as well as any spot business within that industry. But basically, I am looking for, at least in our products and companies, more about Plateau, more about not being able to move prices up, but not too much pressure other than where we are at today. So, if that makes sense to you, that's about as close as I can give it to you.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
I appreciate the color. Last question and I will turn it over. You've given some directional guidance on Q2. We understand Flat-Rolled is improving sequentially. Kind of what is your view today on the back-half of this year in terms of EPS? What is Q4 likely to look like? I mean, are going to two bucks a share? Is there… I mean, give us some color because there are a lot of moving pieces here?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. I think if I had my own way, I'd probably give your guidance. But we are not going to give guidance on this year. We've given guidance very clearly into the fourth and first quarter of this year. I would like to get off that by just simply talking about what the markets are, what the indicators are, and you're going to have to put your own bent to what you think is going to happen in the market. What we are saying is that we see the second quarter improving and we see our position gaining some speed going forward. Exactly how everything works out in this world and what happens to the exact number of scrap prices or reactions of the competitors as to their own volumes and situations, we are going to just have to see how that road works out and navigate through it.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen And Company
Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of David Martin with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Martin - Deutsche Bank Securities
Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask a few questions principally on the stainless market. First of all, can you update us on your operating rates in that market? I think you had said in the first quarter you pretty much operated at full capacity within your target base load. Has that continued into the second quarter? And then secondly, can you give us a little bit of color on the divergence in the markets, both in the U.S. and Europe? It has been slightly reported that price attempts by you have failed in the U.S. marketplace, but despite that prices continue to increase in Europe and some of your European peers are out trying to raise prices now for the third quarter. And then lastly, can you give us a sense of how many tons you would have shipped that to the U.S. into Europe in the quarter?

L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I can just tell you on the last part of your question that we're getting more and more interest in shipping more tons to Europe, I’d not like to report that exact number. I'll tell you that we were shipping at the highest levels we have ever exported into Europe. The European markets are actually moving faster than the U.S. market and prices are actually rising and looks like that that market is returning to more normal levels.
In regards to our own operating schedules, we are actually operating at a fuller rate in the second quarter than in the first quarter, but it all depends on exactly which part of our sub-units in this business that you are really talking about. So let me just come back. Our nickel-based alloys and super alloys are operating at a higher level now in the second quarter than the first quarter. We are at about 85% of our highest levels ever. Highest levels that we have ever operated in during 2007, we are about 15% under that right now. Our electrical steel business is running as much volume as it can possibly put out the door. Our plate business was choppy in the first quarter because of project work that either got delayed or with the banking and credit issues and all that was going on, just simply got moved out a couple of months and that business is now going to be operating at a much higher level, I'm not saying 100% but a much higher level than it was in the first quarter. We're at 85,000 tons in the first quarter. We're going to be higher than that to achieve better returns and also more stable pricing in our standard sheet in the second quarter. So generally speaking, when you look at our second quarter, we're going to be operating at pretty much full.
The other issue that we have, as we go into the third quarter we usually have some summer maintenance schedules to take care of on standard kind of maintenance schedules. So we're going to be pushing production into the second quarter. So I think we're going to operate at pretty full levels all the way through.
On the price increase, I think they are moving in that direction as you pointed out in Europe and I think that's… that appears solid. And in the U.S., we just had one competitor that evidently wasn't full or didn't think they should raise prices.
David Martin - Deutsche Bank Securities
Okay. And then just wanted to follow-up on electrical steels. I know you've commented in the past that you're going to see pretty meaningful price increases on contracts in '08. Were those fully reflected in the first quarter? Are there some that get re-priced at different times of the year?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This has been integrated strategy that we had put into place where we have some contracts that expired in January. We have other contracts that will be expiring at the end of this year in the fourth quarter of this year. So we have not fully realized the full benefits of our changes in the electrical silicon business. And so we still have some customers that are basically, let's say, running on 2007 contracts that will expire sometime before or… before 2009. We've other customers that have just been re-priced for 2008 that will run for the next few years. And we now have a situation that basically 90% of our business is under one type of a contract or another and these contracts are integrated throughout each year. So we have a blended price going forward.
David Martin - Deutsche Bank Securities
Okay. Thank you.

Year next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
David MacGregor - Longbow Research
Yes. Good afternoon, everyone.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hi, David.
David MacGregor - Longbow Research
Pat, just on the stainless business, if you're not getting the price increase, can you just talk about your inability to improve second quarter gross margins in stainless?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we do have a price increase in the ready coil and we do have price increases on offshore businesses. So that's the first point, okay. Secondly, we are improving situations in plate and in high-performance side of that business, both in titanium, nickel-based alloys, and we're already full on electrical steels. We're talking about standard sheet and standard sheet only… and will have greater volume.
David MacGregor - Longbow Research
And can you just talk a little bit about your... maybe to the extent you can talk about just the cost base on your scrap, when does cheaper scrap start to flow through the P&L?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think in the… I think now, I think in the second quarter certainly got not a few pennies per share in the first quarter.
David MacGregor - Longbow Research
Okay. Second question just has to do… I guess back onto the titanium issue and you talked about your ability to redirect titanium if this Boeing program should continue to pushed out further. I'm just wondering what the capacity is of those other markets might be to absorb that redirected material? It doesn’t seem like that long ago we were getting excited about golf club heads and high glass frames, and 787 seems to really have been the driver since 2004. So without that, I'm just trying to get a sense from you what you feel the capacity might be to move that product?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think there is two things. It is really the infrastructure build around the world. What we are seeing is… and I think I made a comment in the press release that our bookings in the Asian market were at record levels in 2007 and we’re far exceeding those levels in 2008. This is basically titanium industrial applications. So, we are talking about products that are going into chemical processing industry, sulfuric acid plants, we're talking about clean water, we're talking about the Middle East, we're talking nuclear applications on the rebuild and some of the projects going on there. So, we work finding people are coming and knocking on our door as they believe that titanium is more readily available and at prices that they can afford and also that the industrial side of the market can move back into titanium applications that maybe were being substituted by high nickel-based steels, stainless steel.
David MacGregor - Longbow Research
Good. Thanks, and good luck to you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Olin with Cleveland Research. Please proceed.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Hi there.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Chris.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Pat, I just want to make sure I am clear. What exactly is going on in the nickel-based alloys marketplace? I know you talked a little bit about distributors, but is there something else within those numbers that may get lower than it shouldn’t [ph] be?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, it was whereas volumes that I think happened in the first quarter, if you’re talk about the first quarter results and lower volumes and more competitive pricing were my comments. Two things happened; one, it was kind of a one-time quarter in that I think we saw people that because of their earnings last year may have pulled more nickel into the fourth… our fourth quarter of 2007. And then, we also had other people in the marketplace that have fiscal quarters ending that maybe pushed some material out of the first quarter into our second quarter. So, we think that the second quarter right now, Chris, appears to be very similar to the quantities that we shipped in the fourth quarter, recovering to more normal levels, and we will see where we are. I think from a competitive standpoint, as we looked at some of the quotes we were seeing in the marketplace that we saw people getting more aggressive about bringing nickel into their order base. So, we'll just have to see how that plays out as these markets come back in increasing volume.

On the sheet side of the business, we saw a… very much of a filling of our schedule over the first quarter into second and third quarter kind of schedule. So, we are watching that carefully. We'll just have to see where it recovers. I’d just characterize it this way. Volumes are going to be covered and we are going to watch the competitive pricing situation.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Is there any issue with the 787 on that specific marketplace or is --?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Not through us because we were growing into that market and so we're growing. And again it's frangible kind of products for us. What I like about the aerospace business in general, it’s at the early stages. They’ve got 7000 airplanes on order. The strategy continues to be to ramp the existing models, especially the later versions, and we have two more airplanes coming on stream. So, it's very important to recognize that as Boeing or Airbus moved from the, let's say, 450 to 475 range, and then to the 500 to 525 range. But this is significant business to all of their suppliers without the new airplane programs. And so as we do that plus add the 380 I think first to that airplane ramp and then a more gradual ramp now on the 787, we're going to see those volumes continue to grow, only on a much more gradual basis than a steep-stepped ramp.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Okay. I guess lastly, I'm not sure if anybody else has tried, so I'll give it a shot. Can you define somewhat better, I mean consensus for the second quarter is 170, [inaudible] 150, 160?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I am going to let Rich answer the question... on that.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Chris. It is somewhat better. What we said was we thought the first quarter at $1.40 was the bottom. For all the reasons Pat has articulated, we see the second quarter is somewhat better, and we're really not going to get into the… giving specific guidance because when we do that nobody seems to listen to us anyway. So, we will stick with a somewhat better description.
Chris Olin - Cleveland Research
Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Parr with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay. Thanks very much. Good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Mark.
Mark Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets
I just wanted to make sure I heard what you had said in response to the question that Chris just asked. When you were talking about the Flat-Rolled nickel alloy, did you say that volume moment was picking up in the second and third quarter based on your older momentum?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We had a record load during a portion of 2007. We are now back to 85% of that record load, which is a very, very good forward load for us. So I think we see flat to increasing prices. We see more volume, especially in our nickel-based alloys. When you couple that with the CP sheet, we should see some very nice numbers coming out of our high performance side of the Flat-Rolled business.
Mark Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay. And if I could ask one more question, on the... as far as your service center business in the stainless market, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from an inventory perspective here as we move into the second quarter?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think what's happening in this market with all the uncertainties and issues that we have, it's unusual and as you know for these U.S. distributors to have inventories at three times their annual shipments… 3.1 times their annual shipments.

Mark Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Yes. These are very low numbers.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Very, very low numbers. Secondly, they're willing to pay a substantial premium for the mills inventories within ready coil to handle the outages or to handle special requirements or the buffer through to the business. So the question is, are they going to continue to operate at these levels or at some point in time are they just simply going to say they're going to restock? And I think we're getting nickel prices that seem to be leveling out in the current 12.90 to 13.20, let's say, ranges. I think as people get comfortable with the fact that those numbers are going to be relatively stable and they look and see that certain parts of this market continue to pull on a very strong basis, I'll give you… one example is appliances. You may think that the appliance market might be suffering from the housing market. I can tell you the appliance market are running wide open, and that is maybe after market or somebody not going to buy a new house, but they are going to remodel their old kitchen, I don't really know. But I can tell you that the appliance markets are very strong in comparison to what you might think in the housing market. So I think they’re seeing not an escalating great business, but they are certainly seeing a sustained, stable business at a higher level than what we saw in the.... certainly in the second half of last year and into the first quarter. It is improving and getting stronger. So I think the prices in that market and volumes… volume is definitely moving up for us and prices are flat too, improving in that market. There is certainly not going to be more discounting.
Mark Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets
So maybe if I could just ask you just a general macro question, given what you just shared when you think based on your customers and the business you are seeing, do you think we're moving closer to or further away from a recessionary scenario for the economy?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we can only talk about the segments that we deal with, and the segments that we deal with in durable goods and then of course in the… some of the things that I just mentioned, we think well over 50% of our revenues are coming really from end customers that are outside United States.
Mark Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And if we take away housing and automotive, which hurt us in the precision strip business in the U.S, two things happened. We would say that our markets are getting better, and when we add the international markets to it and the value of the U.S. dollar, let's say, into EU markets, we've opportunities to grow in those markets. And when we look at the growth in China and India, you can argue whether the growth in China is going to be 9% or 14%. So the first quarter it was over 10%, the second quarter looks very busy for us, and when we look at the opportunities to sell into the Middle East and to India, we see the same kind of things, 8% or 9% growth. So for products that we're making in the specialty infrastructure build kind of things, electricity, distribution of electricity, power generation, clean water, these kind of infrastructure, applications that requires specialty materials, which really those economies are not making and haven't had the technology or the provision to make, we see a pretty bright future for that segment of the business. If I was going to worry about anything, I’d still worry like everybody else does that 70% of the markets are driven by the consumer in the U.S. So we're pushing our strategies to those durable goods markets in the international markets for a diversified product base and a diversified strategy of selling around the world.

Your next question comes from the line of Sanil Daptardar with Sentinel. Please proceed.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Thanks. In the opening comments, you mentioned about the high-performance metal segment that the marketplace is getting more competitive. Could you just elaborate on that what you mean by that?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we've seen it mostly on the nickel-based alloys where people have put some capacities in over the last year. I think they would like to fill those capacities and it depends on where they are qualified or what segments that they were in. When you look at ATI's mill products, and this is where you have to differentiate this company from some of the other companies, we produce products that range from seamless tubing and wire to sheet and plate and rounds and shapes that we can enter various segments to produce products that are needed in those segments. Other people have a more narrower alley to go down. And so, as we go…. come into some of those markets to sell products, we can see more competitive pricing today than what we saw in 2007.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Okay. So… then your commentary on flat to increasing prices may not remain... may not stand still in that case, then we may probably see some price increases in that business, right?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think when we look at the [inaudible] side of the business, super alloys and nickel-based alloys and titanium products, that… what I said is that we see a much stronger workload on the books today and the second quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter and even entering into the first quarter. So with that kind of a situation and extending lead times on those products, my history has been when you have order loads that are growing, you have lead times that are extending and you have global access indeed that prices eventually move with that.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Okay.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Rich, go ahead.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, just one more thing. When you look at the High Performance Metals segment and more specifically the nickel and specialty alloys products in that segment, about 60% of our business in that segment in nickel and specialty alloys is under long-term agreements. So there you really… you don't have the kind of pricing issues that we're talking about other than the changes in the raw material indices.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Okay.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Okay?
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
That's a good clarification. On the Boeing contract, of course you would be shipping the volumes. Now, in case of the pricing for those volumes, is it at the market rate or it’s at the contract price? And does it tend to move with the market rate or what? How is that contract structure?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It is at contract pricing, but it does reflect metal indices that change, but it's a contracted price for the base pricing with some leading indicators around the raw materials that go into the pricing metrics and that's part of the overall formula. So… but it's fixed pricing.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Okay. It's fixed pricing. So --.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
With raw material indices that reflect the cost of raw material.

Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Well, for example, now you had a 22% decline in the titanium products average selling price. So is that reflected in that Boeing contract kind of… if there is a decline in the price then probably that your price might be also declining with it?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
The price would decline, but it doesn't necessarily mean the margins will decline. It should not mean the margins declined. The price declines because we can buy raw materials at lower prices. Now, when we look at that, this is where we get into this problem in a short period of time, in a three-month, four-month, six-month period of time of mismatches of material we have in this system or have procured in our own arrangements and what we can sell for as prices are changing. So that's the mismatch that I think gave us some lower earnings in the first quarter.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Okay. If I ask the last question [inaudible], on the distributor side, you saw that they are not restocking, but the destocking cycle is over. What rate do you have when the distributors may start restocking basically to stainless products?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, usually if there is a restocking then we are going to see schedules moving and pricing moving. So… because we’re… we and most other mills are running at fairly good volumes for these markets and with the U.S. dollar where it is, it isn't very profitable for certain foreign mills to be shipping into the U.S. from product produced in their own country. The exception for that is countries that may manipulate currency and bring it into the U.S.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
In other words is the restocking basically would be dependent on the demand. If they are not seeing any kind of improvement in the demand, is there a need for restocking, that's what the distributors might be wondering. So, is that the way one should read that or --?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think if they see the demand as stable and where it is and things leveling up, the question they have to ask themselves at that point in time is are we going to continue to buy from the mills inventories of ready coil at premium prices or decide to restock some of these quantities and carry the risk in our own inventories. Today, they are choosing to pay the premium prices to the mills for their inventories that are being carried in ready coil form.
Sanil Daptardar - Sentinel Asset Management
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Hayes with Davenport.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co.
Hi, good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hello.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co.
My question pertains to the High Performance Metals segment and specifically in the nickel-based alloys, the decline in volumes there. I was surprised that the customers waited till Q1 '08 to destock. Is the destocking by customers, is that in a specific end-market such as jet engines or is it in a broader range of end-markets?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think it was across the board. You can a pick a specific customer that decided to pull something into the fourth quarter and then level his business back out into the first quarter that is now back to normal shipment levels. We can isolate a couple of those. You can pick distributors that had higher based nickel in their inventory that they wanted to drain down, take those inventories to a linear level during the first quarter and I think those have… that basically what we were seeing is that we were going to see nickel volumes much more in line with what we had seen in the fourth quarter, starting in the second quarter forward. Rich, go ahead.

Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, this is another expansion of that. The distributor customers for nickel alloys on the High Performance Metals side, those are not the premium materials for aero-engines. Those are products that largely go into the oil taps, to the corrosion markets, the non-critical, more static parts on a jet engine. So, that's really where the inventory management and destocking was going on. I think the OEM customers were more pulling into the fourth quarter or pushing out a little bit into the second quarter depending upon their own unique situation. But it was not a demand driven phenomena. The oil patch market has been going through an inventory destocking phase on nickel alloys for a while and we see that gradually working its way through here in the second quarter, not only in the U.S. market but also in Europe.
Timothy Hayes - Davenport & Co.
Very good. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good afternoon, Sal.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Pat, I was just wondering, hearing your comments it looks like not much is going… happening until the Boeing situation gets a little more clear, which will be a few quarters away from here. You have a lot of cash on your hand, granted you are using a lot of money on CapEx also. I'm sure you'll find your stocks cheap. I am sure some of the investors find it cheap. Why not just… and you are very delevered, why not just lever up and do a massive share buyback?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, our first priority, Sal, is the profitable growth of the company. What we are looking at is the long-term value... sorry, the long-term... this is a long-term franchise, long-term really value-based franchise. If you believe in the aerospace business and if you believe in the infrastructure build around the world and if you believe in the technology of this company, its geopolitical security and its ability with the U.S. dollar today to ship on a global basis, the best use of our money today for our shareholders is to position this company both from an unsurpassed manufacturing capability and the technology that we have into this new base to provide new opportunities and new products to grow this company and really make it a long-term franchise for someone to hold. That's our first priority.
Second priority comes after that is dividend policy of the company. We've had increasing dividends over the last three years and we have an announced and specified share repurchase program. We think in today's world a company that has the balance sheet that we have, growing in the right markets with the right technology in the right country is a heck of a value at the price of where we are today. And we believe that as we demonstrate that with the stability of earnings that we have even in this down cycle over the last six months, with the stability of earnings that we have and the ability to increase those earnings in the short to medium term, that's the best use of our cash and that’s what we are doing in a very balanced way.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Okay. Going back on the nickel-based alloys I was just wondering, if I look at the... you mentioned that nickel-based alloys had a base price plus some... plus the raw material cost. If I go back at $13 nickel level, these prices were hovering around $15, $16 a pound. Has something changed or do you think there is a lag effect and you may go down to that level on your average selling price going forward?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I think that in the contracted business we have that the prices are pretty much set. I think in… depending on what happens to the total market and the volume and how aggressive the industry wants to get on picking up certain parts of the spot business that it could be a very competitive market for a period of time until the volumes in the aerospace business continue to pick up under these new build rates. We continue to see another 10% or 15% to 20% build in the next 18 months out of the aerospace business. We continue to see the need for energy in these big land-based turbines and growth in the Middle East and also growth in Asia. We continue to see the need in the nuclear business. This is all going to catch up. So there is going to be some short-term dislocations if you want to call them that, some competitive issues. We are a company that's well positioned, that has a market share that is not going to erode. So, yes, we may meet some of those situations along the way.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Sal, this is Richard. Another thing to reflect upon is that when nickel prices were $15, $16, $17, $18 a pound, obviously the information we disclose is heavily mix sensitive. What product form we're selling, is it an ingot, billet, bar, et cetera, what grade of nickel is it because they are all different kind of grades in terms of how much nickel contained is in it, but if you go back to our third quarter and the public information that is out there, when nickel was at a much higher price the average prices for the products as we disclosed it were over $20. So when nickel was at $15 or $16, the average selling prices were not at $15 or $16.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Got it. So it looks like your base prices have come up also.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Once again it just depends upon what the product is and what the market is.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
Okay. And one more, on the mismatch between inventories… sorry, raw materials and selling price you mentioned, how much inventory do you tell… how many months should we expect this mismatch to continue? And continuing on that, I thought that you're using lot more sponge now because you're making about what, 22 million tons of sponge and using lot less scrap.
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, on the nickel side we are a net buyer of outside nickel and we do use scrap and we do have revert programs coming back through the company. Our lead times on nickel are well into the third quarter. And if you want a shape or a rectangle it moves out further, if you want a round bar it's center. So we’ll just have to see how the markets play out in total. As Rich pointed out, two-thirds of what we're doing is under contract. Those prices are set. So we have that one-third exposure to whatever happens in the market.
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
And I think the… we… obviously the answer to the question of how long until the indices and surcharges are in better balance with the cost flowing through the income statement depend on the stability of the raw material cost. We believe that, and we’ve said this in the news release, that those indices and surcharges are in much better balance heading into the second quarter than they were in the first quarter.
On your question in terms of titanium sponge, yes, we're using all the sponge we're producing at Albany. That gives us a defined cost, but not all of our products are 100% sponge melted. So generally, a heat contains a mix of both sponge and scrap and the indices are based off of that.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs

Do you have ability to use more sponge in your products or some of the products don't lend themselves to [inaudible]?
Richard J. Harshman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
In some cases we can use all sponge sheets, in other cases… in many cases we cannot because of the metallurgical specifications and targets we're trying to hit.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
And you're bringing more sponge capacity early next year. Are you confident that there will be enough demand or you will just be replacing more and more scrap with that?
L. Patrick Hassey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We'll be replacing some scrap, but we also are buying from the outside. So as that comes up and we reach the 50 million pound level… you remember, we started this year off that 40 million pound level, we’re adding 10 million pounds this year. I think we will be in pretty much balance of what we need to do next year. What we're looking forward to after that is the ramp to the 60 million pound level, which won't happen unless we see the new airplane program, so that's our feeling. When that happens then we'll see the rest of these facilities ramp up with it. So that's where we are.
Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs
