Our Story 



Home / Who We Are / Our Story 













Capital Wealth Advisors is a values-driven company, with a passion for building solid relationships.
Co-Founders Bill Beynon and Blaine Ferguson have known each other their entire lives. Born just a month apart in Northern West Virginia, they attended pre-school through college together, forming a lifelong friendship. After college, Bill was recruited into the insurance industry. His career took him to Naples, Florida, where he became a Partner in a financial and estate planning firm. Blaine joined the United States Marine Corps and served as a helicopter pilot in Kosovo and Afghanistan, achieving the rank of Major. Following 10 years of duty, Blaine transitioned to a career as an advisor with a national brokerage firm in Atlanta, Georgia. Although worlds apart, Bill and Blaine remained close and spoke often about the future.
Day One
Without any clients, Capital Wealth Advisors launched on December 1, 2004. That first day Bill and Blaine worked on folding tables in a partially completed office in Downtown Naples. Although they were surrounded by bare walls and temporary lighting, they were determined to grow the firm in a large, broad-based financial services firm.
Hometown Connection
Over the next 8 years, Capital Wealth Advisors grew rapidly, adding an asset management business and a family office.
In 2012, while hosting a West Virginia University Alumni event, Bill and Blaine met Frank Cerminara. As it would turn, Frank grew up in the same area as Bill and Blaine in Northern West Virginia. Frank immediately saw the potential for a business partnership and suggested that Bill and Blaine meet his son Kyle and fellow business partners Lewis Johnson and Joe Moglia, who had just started their own asset management firm, Fundamental Global Investors.  Kyle and Lewis had spent their careers working for prestigious firms such as T Rowe Price, Louis Dreyfus and Pequot Capital. Joe also lead an illustrious career as the former CEO and current Chairman of TD Ameritrade. In a very short time, it became evident that working together would result in a whole much stronger than the sum of its parts.
In 2012, Capital Wealth Advisors and Fundamental Global Investors formed a partnership. Kyle Cerminara and Lewis Johnson serve as the Co-Chief Investment Officers of the firm. As the current Chairman of TD Ameritrade, Joe brings many years of experience and wisdom that are invaluable to the growth and vision of the firm.
Today
Since 2004, Capital Wealth Advisors has experienced tremendous growth in its Asset Management, Risk Management, and Family Office divisions. The Capital Wealth Advisors team has grown to over 20 professionals and the company has thrived. In addition to its headquarters in Naples, Florida, the firm has offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, Mooresville, North Carolina, and Omaha, Nebraska. Today, Capital Wealth Advisors has clients in over 40 states and has achieved national recognition for its work. Most importantly, Capital Wealth Advisors is active in the local community, giving time and resources to various local charities.
As we look to the future, we do so with the knowledge that we will continue to rely upon the principles that have successfully brought us to this point – namely, a foundation built upon solid relationships, commitment and a willingness to embrace opportunity.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for EQ (TSE:EQ) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Personal Managers Interchange
May 19, 2017  by Frank Page Las Vegas was the hosting city for the National Conference of Personal Managers.  As a CPA, I’m a numbers guy, so I notice things about numbers, especially percentages, all the time. This trip I discovered that the 30% rule for withholding tax on foreign entertainers is loathed by 100% of the personal managers I talked with 100% of the time, even at the Pass Line of the crap table where that 1.41% house edge also had a 100% loathed rate.
Filed Under: Company News Jazz Fest in New Orleans
May 7, 2017  by Frank Page  
I love New Orleans. Over the years I’ve made numerous trips to The Big Easy for both business and vacations, but this was my very first trip to the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, more commonly referred to as Jazz Fest! We had 6 Cuban groups performing there this year so it was a great opportunity to finally experience this event. It was huge and absolutely wonderful; from the many stages offering an auditory buffet of musical styles to the thousands of fans synced to their rhythms and last but not least, to the incredible choice of good eats to be had by all. I can best describe it with one word; Fun! I’m already looking forward to returning next year.

Filed Under: Company News East Coast Music Awards
May 1, 2017  by Frank Page Saint John, New Brunswick was the site of the East Coast Music Awards shows this year – the first time they have been back to the city in 15 years.
This is one of the friendliest cities on the planet. I had the opportunity to visit Saint John about 10 years ago as a stop on a cruise.
A few hours in a town gives only an appetizer. Spending three nights there is excellent.
I had a chance to see a few clients perform. I’m happy to report that one of our clients, Les Hotesses d’Hilaire, won the 2017 Enregistrement Francophone de L’Annee Award. (Francophone Record of the Year)

This is an incredibly well-run festival that may end up on my regular annual circuit. Next year it is in Halifax – another wonderful Canadian city I would like to go back to.
Filed Under: Company News 22nd Annual Indy Irish Fest
April 22, 2017  by Frank Page 
 
Ah, the Indy Irish Fest. As you may have guessed, Indianapolis was the site of this bi-annual conference and just like my previous trip to Austin, it was my first time to the city. Also like Austin, this is a state capital with a tremendous amount of historical sites to see. Finally, like Austin, Indianapolis would be an easy city to spend at least three days taking a short vacation…if I did such a thing.
This was the largest conference AICF (Association of Irish and Celtic Festivals) has ever had with over 100 attendees.
 

His Hooleyness, Pope Malarkey I was there. He was kind enough to present me with a card good for 1 free sin. I think if I acquire 8734 more, I break even in life.
 
It was great to see a lot of friends again – including the Saint of all Irish Festivals, my good friend Ed Ward.
Filed Under: Company News SXSW
March 18, 2017  by Frank Page 
 
This was my very first SXSW trip. Austin is a spectacular city; one that I will come back to for a three-day vacation in the near future.
I had a chance to meet with some wonderful folks from both Europe and the US.
The short and the sweet? SXSW is now on my list of conferences that I will attend every year.
Filed Under: Company News Korean Zombie Returns to UFC!
February 5, 2017  by Frank Page Last night our client, Chan Sung Jun, was back in the Octagon as the headline event in the UFC Fight Night 104 at the Houston Toyota Center. He was returning after a three and a half year layoff in which he was serving mandatory required military duty in South Korea.
The crowd went wild after he won with a knockout in the first of a scheduled five rounds.
Here are some more snippets of the event from Bleacher Report:

Chan Sung Jung puts the finishing touches on Dennis Bermudez at UFC Fight Night on Saturday night.Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports
Three-and-a-half years isn’t an eternity, but in the land of combat sports, it can be something close. In this cruel world, fighters can age out in months. When you’re talking years, you’re talking eras.
Witness, for instance, the story of Chan Sung Jung, who last competed in August 2013 before missing time to an injury and mandatory military service in his native South Korea.
So 1,282 days later, at UFC Fight Night in Houston on Saturday, Jung returned as a mystery. Such lengthy breaks during a fighter’s prime are nearly unprecedented in major MMA. Yet there he was, still just 29 years old and, for onlookers, frozen in time and reputation.
Would he return rusty? As if he hadn’t skipped a beat? Improved?
The answer was a combination of it all. But in the end, the Zombie did what the Zombie does, overcoming stacked odds, surviving danger, then eating his opponent’s soul.
 
This photo was taken the night before when Cecile met with Chan. His smile is from Cecile telling him how much more money he’ll be taking home due to using our services for filing a proper Tax Withholding Agreement.

February 4, 2017  by Frank Page Last night Jackie and I had the opportunity to go back to House of Blues at Disney Springs.
Our client from Canada, Protest the Hero, was performing to a packed house.
They were the feature group for August Burns Red’s 10th-anniversary Tour.
 
Here’s a picture of Jackie with Tim MacMillar after the show-

Filed Under: Company News APAP – 2017 in New York City
January 8, 2017  by Frank Page 
 
I’m in New York City again for this year’s APAP convention. There is a reason why I have lived in Florida for more than 50 years. I’ve also discovered you can no longer make snow angels in front of the Trump Tower…
Filed Under: Company News CERTIFIED ACCEPTANCE AGENTS/ITINs
January 1, 2017  by Frank Page 
CWA Management is very excited to announce that our sister company, Business Development Partners Inc, has been appointed as a Certified Acceptance Agent by the IRS. Business Development Partners is a 29 year CPA firm based in Orlando. We strongly believe that foreign artists should get a US Social Security Number if possible. We consider it to be a superior number to an ITIN. However, there are times when getting an SSN is not possible. An ITIN may be the only solution to getting tax refunded. We can do this for you!
Here is a good article written by Daniel Hood from the website Accounting Today that goes into further detail about expiring ITINs for 2017.

Many ITINs due to expire, IRS warns
Many Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers will expire on Jan. 1, 2017, and ITIN holders hoping to avoid refund delays should renew now, the Internal Revenue Service is warning.
ITINs are used by anyone who has to pay or file U.S. taxes, but isn’t eligible for a Social Security number. Under a recent tax law change, ITINs that haven’t been used on a tax return in the last three years will expire at the beginning of next year.
Also set to expire are ITINs with 78 or 79 as the fourth and fifth digits (9NN-79-NNNN or 9NN-79-NNNN).
While those with expired ITINs can apply for renewal after January 1, the IRS is warning that the usual application period of as little as seven weeks is likely to be as much as four weeks longer for those who submit in January and February.
The service also noted that is seeing a number of common mistakes on renewal applications so far, primarily involving missing information and insufficient supporting information.
Filed Under: Company News Dr. Phillips Charities
November 22, 2016  by Frank Page Last evening Jackie and I had the opportunity to attend “An Evening of Thanks” hosted by Dr. Phillips Charities.
This was in appreciation of first responders and their unwavering, daily commitment to the safety of Central Florida.
Rascal Flatts was the entertainment. We don’t get an opportunity to see many American groups and it was a thrill to watch them perform.
The real excitement was watching the law enforcement, firefighters and other first responders have an incredible night.
