Need Help Choosing & Comparing ID Card Printers? Here are Some Answers.Click to enlarge image  How do you pick an ID card printer with so many choices available? First, know that every brand offers a range of printers, and many come with flexible options. If your card print needs will change in the future, pick a model that can be upgraded later (look for terms like “modular” or “field upgradable”).Next, learn a bit about the card printer types offered by the leading brands:How do I tell the difference between all the card printers?Value Class Printers – The most basic card printer type, these entry-level printers are the least expensive, but often do not have a wide range of options and do not offer the highest print quality. They are great for low-level security needs.Professional Class Printers – This is a wide ranging group of printers that can work for many applications. They include both standard and high-volume printers, offer professional print quality, and are great for photo ID badges. They can also produce medium or high-security ID cards, depending on the options you choose.Secure Class Printers – The highest security ID cards are produced by retransfer printers, which use a special print technology to produce tamper-resistant cards. These printers and their supplies can be expensive, and are best used in highly-secure areas.Finally, consider your top three ID card factors:How many cards do you need?< 1,000 = Low volume1,000 - 5,000 = Standard volume> 5,000 = High volumeID Expert Tip - Volume is the one factor that cannot be upgraded later, so choose wisely. However, unless you will use your printer every day, you can save quite a bit by purchasing a less expensive low- or standard-volume card printer. It works in 80% of card print situations.What will your cards look like?Single or two-sided cards Full color or single color (monochrome) Print Quality Low surface coverage: Entry-level printers offer OK print quality that works well for basic cardsMedium-to-high surface coverage: Professional-class printers offer photo-quality IDs Highest surface coverage: Retransfer printers offer crystal-clear clarity for high security needsID Expert Tip – A single sided card printer can be used to print on two card sides – you just have to run it through your card printer twice. Some printers can also be upgraded later. Monochrome printers are typically used in specialized situations and don’t offer huge cost savings, so it is almost always more practical to purchase a color printer and use monochrome ribbons. Finally, the difference between the print clarity of an entry-level printer, a professional-class printer and a retransfer printer can be big. Call 877-868-0012 if you want to see some ID card samples from different badge printers before you make a choice.What level of security?Basic ID or membership card – For basic visual identification, any entry-level printer and standard pvc card stock will work. Examples include: loyalty cards, membership cards, student IDs and gift cards.Low Security Magnetic Stripe Cards – For ID swiping, most entry-level and professional class printers with magnetic stripe encoder and card stock will work. Examples include: loyalty cards, hotel cards, gift cards and time cardsMedium Security Access (Smart) Cards – For contactless access control, professional-class printers with smart card encoder will work. Examples include: access control and kiosk payment cards.High Security Laminated or Retransfer Cards – For UV or holographic authentication protocols, professional-class or retransfer printers with lamination module will work. Must use composite PVC card stock. Examples include: high security facility access, drivers’ licenses and rugged use cards.ID Expert Tip – In order to be able to use these features, you must have card stock designed for your encoding technology. While magnetic stripe cards are not much more expensive than plain cards, “smart cards” can cost considerably more.Click to view all our Expert Printer Reviews in our blog or find them directly on select printer pages.Need More Help?

CPI Card Group in Partnership with Evolis Drives Instant Issuance Innovation with Introduction of Precision by Card@Once®
Jun 1 17
CPI Card Group in partnership with Evolis announced the release of Precision by Card@Once®, featuring even faster card processing times paired with higher resolution printing capabilities. As banks and credit unions look to enhance the customer experience through the branch environment, CPI Card Group has played a key role in supporting their efforts to transform through its Card@Once® instant issuance programs. Today, financial institutions nationwide leverage the solution to print more than 3.6 million cards a year, on-demand, for their customers. The pace and level of market adoption suggest a growing demand for the technology’s features and functionality, all of which are more advanced and robust in Precision by Card@Once®. The new printer includes a color touch screen display which allows users to more easily track the progress of the printing process and manage any maintenance updates as needed. The visual impact of printed cards is enhanced through the solution’s high resolution capabilities and data security is ensured through a dual access control locking mechanism, requiring a trackable physical key and an access code. The system also embeds a new technology which has been patented by Evolis.

CPI Card Group Canada Inc. Key Developments

Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation Selects CPI Card Group-Canada Inc. as Manufacturer for First-Ever Canadian Lottery Gift Card Program
Nov 22 16
CPI Card Group announced that CPI Card Group in Toronto, Ontario was selected by the Ontario Lottery & Gaming Corporation (OLG) to produce more than 2.4 million lottery gift cards. The cards are part of the first-ever gift card program offered by a Canadian provincial lottery corporation and one of the first such programs offered in North America. CPI’s proven track record and success providing high-quality product and services helped position CPI to gain the OLG contract. CPI will liaise directly with OLG to produce the closed-loop gift cards as part of OLG’s efforts. Cards will be sold by more than 8,000 lottery retail locations province-wide and are redeemable for any lottery product, whereas those sold from gift card malls featured within mass retail stores can be redeemed for either LOTTO 6/49 or LOTTO MAX lottery games. In all cases, the cards provide a brand new experience for OLG’s customers, allowing them to share the gift of lottery while enabling gift recipients to select and purchase their favorite lottery tickets.

Need Help Choosing & Comparing ID Card Printers? Here are Some Answers.Click to enlarge image  How do you pick an ID card printer with so many choices available? First, know that every brand offers a range of printers, and many come with flexible options. If your card print needs will change in the future, pick a model that can be upgraded later (look for terms like “modular” or “field upgradable”).Next, learn a bit about the card printer types offered by the leading brands:How do I tell the difference between all the card printers?Value Class Printers – The most basic card printer type, these entry-level printers are the least expensive, but often do not have a wide range of options and do not offer the highest print quality. They are great for low-level security needs.Professional Class Printers – This is a wide ranging group of printers that can work for many applications. They include both standard and high-volume printers, offer professional print quality, and are great for photo ID badges. They can also produce medium or high-security ID cards, depending on the options you choose.Secure Class Printers – The highest security ID cards are produced by retransfer printers, which use a special print technology to produce tamper-resistant cards. These printers and their supplies can be expensive, and are best used in highly-secure areas.Finally, consider your top three ID card factors:How many cards do you need?< 1,000 = Low volume1,000 - 5,000 = Standard volume> 5,000 = High volumeID Expert Tip - Volume is the one factor that cannot be upgraded later, so choose wisely. However, unless you will use your printer every day, you can save quite a bit by purchasing a less expensive low- or standard-volume card printer. It works in 80% of card print situations.What will your cards look like?Single or two-sided cards Full color or single color (monochrome) Print Quality Low surface coverage: Entry-level printers offer OK print quality that works well for basic cardsMedium-to-high surface coverage: Professional-class printers offer photo-quality IDs Highest surface coverage: Retransfer printers offer crystal-clear clarity for high security needsID Expert Tip – A single sided card printer can be used to print on two card sides – you just have to run it through your card printer twice. Some printers can also be upgraded later. Monochrome printers are typically used in specialized situations and don’t offer huge cost savings, so it is almost always more practical to purchase a color printer and use monochrome ribbons. Finally, the difference between the print clarity of an entry-level printer, a professional-class printer and a retransfer printer can be big. Call 877-868-0012 if you want to see some ID card samples from different badge printers before you make a choice.What level of security?Basic ID or membership card – For basic visual identification, any entry-level printer and standard pvc card stock will work. Examples include: loyalty cards, membership cards, student IDs and gift cards.Low Security Magnetic Stripe Cards – For ID swiping, most entry-level and professional class printers with magnetic stripe encoder and card stock will work. Examples include: loyalty cards, hotel cards, gift cards and time cardsMedium Security Access (Smart) Cards – For contactless access control, professional-class printers with smart card encoder will work. Examples include: access control and kiosk payment cards.High Security Laminated or Retransfer Cards – For UV or holographic authentication protocols, professional-class or retransfer printers with lamination module will work. Must use composite PVC card stock. Examples include: high security facility access, drivers’ licenses and rugged use cards.ID Expert Tip – In order to be able to use these features, you must have card stock designed for your encoding technology. While magnetic stripe cards are not much more expensive than plain cards, “smart cards” can cost considerably more.Click to view all our Expert Printer Reviews in our blog or find them directly on select printer pages.Need More Help?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
