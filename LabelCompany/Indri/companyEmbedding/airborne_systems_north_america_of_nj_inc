When Your Commute Is 25,000 feet...SOLR™ Airborne Systems designs and manufactures a line of oxygen products for the most extreme HAHO and HALO missions, known as SOLR™.



 
jTrax Navaid™Navigation From Above The jTrax Navaid is a device worn on a jumper’s harness to aid in navigation to the intended Impact Point (IP). The Navaid improves safety and increases effectiveness of military jumpers by providing accurate navigation for even the most demanding missions.



 
What are combo drops? Combo drops are anytime a GPADS is used in conjunction with jumpers. The GPADS can either fly itself to the pre-programmed coordinates, or a jumper can manually steer it to the destination. This proves extremely helpful in covert missions, minimizing the amount of gear the jumper must carry.



 
Hi-5®OUR NEWEST CANOPY Airborne Systems has designed a revolutionary ram air parachute like no other.  Visit the Hi-5® page and watch the video to learn how we are changing the future of parachutes.



 
Intruder System (RA-1)Ram-Air Tactical Parachute Systems Superior glide performance for maximum offset and performance characteristics to minimize the potential for injury on landing.

SOLR™ Oxygen Mask























SOLR™ Oxygen Mask
Overview
SpecificationsSpec SheetsRelated Products 

Overview



The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask builds on the reliability and strong features of its predecessor, the Airborne Systems’ PHAOS Oxygen Mask, the current reference for the Parachutist Oxygen Masks used by Military Units worldwide.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask is compatible with the new SOLR™ and legacy PHAOS Bailout Bottles. It is also compatible with the PHANTOM Bailout Bottle.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask provides the same performance and time proven reliability as the PHAOS Oxygen Mask, with the added benefit of new features developed based on input received from experiences collected over the years from the Military Free Fall community.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask features a new non-dilution oxygen demand regulator which delivers 100% oxygen during inhalation, both during pre-breathing and during the actual jump and descent under canopy.  This ensures that the jumper is never breathing a mix of gas and mitigates the risk of hypoxia, drastically increasing the safety of operation.  This breakthrough innovation is made possible thanks to the very high service pressure of Airborne Systems’ latest Bailout Bottles, allowing them to contain significantly more oxygen than traditional Bailout Bottles.
Key Features:

Lightweight
On demand regulator, no dilution (100% O2)
Modular (dilution module optional)
Compatible with SOLR / PHAOS / PHANTOM Bailout Bottles
5 sizes
Compatible with all parachutist helmets on the market
Easy maintenance

Intruder System (RA-1)

Suited for a novice in need of docile performance or an experienced pilot who demands performance extremes for mission success.

Intended for use during HALO or HAHO missions, the Intruder 360 main canopy incorporates a design developed by Airborne Systems that improves velocity and glide.
Pressurized stabilizers increase glide performance and improve performance in deep brakes by forcing the canopy to track forward without lateral slip. The pressurized stabilizers also render the canopy completely silent.

Manufacturer Jumps in to Reduce Waste and Lands New Business While Reducing Costs







Manufacturer Jumps in to Reduce Waste and Lands New Business While Reducing Costs

April 2, 2013




Airborne Systems North America New Jersey Operations engineers and manufactures high-quality, high-performance personnel and cargo aerial delivery systems. It also manufactures related products for the military, search & rescue and space & recovery industry.
For nearly a century, the company has set the standard for capability, quality and performance with its world-class engineering, manufacturing, training and service. The company employees 175 people in New Jersey who continue to build on Airborne’s innovative accomplishments with an uncompromising commitment to provide best-of-class and value parachute products and services to its customers worldwide.
Airborne’s products are more than just parachutes. They design, manufacture and support a diverse range of products with safety and quality requirements in mind at every step. Airborne Systems introduced lean methodologies into their growing operations to continue to deliver their quality products on time and in an efficient and cost competitive manner. Airborne Systems turned to New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program, Inc. (NJMEP) to help them accomplish this objective.
NJMEP worked closely with the management of Airborne Systems to develop a training program for implementing Lean.  Through Value Stream Mapping (VSM), a Lean technique that captures a picture of the work process, analyzes its problems and then creates a new work process, specific operations were streamlined. The project took place over a 10-day period and produced significant savings.
NJMEP also helped facilitate a Cellular Flow Manufacturing Project, a Kaizen Blitz. Kaizen Events are designed to improve standardized activities and processes. They are similar to VSM in that they are designed to eliminate waste, saving time / money in the manufacturing process.
The Blitz used a multi-functional team of 6-8 people from within the organization.  The team learned the Cellular/Flow Manufacturing concepts and applied them to a specified process. Through a five-step approach, the team would: 1. Define the current process using of flowcharting, 2. Map the process, 3. Measure the Process performance, and 4. Observe the process and 5. Re-design the process for substantial improvements. The objective of the process is to provide the organization with: 1. A layout of the proposed process; 2. Projected performance measures for the new process; 3. Detailed workstation designs; 4. An implementation plan and actions list.
Airborne Systems was surveyed as to the impact the Cellular Flow Manufacturing Project had on the company.  Airborne’s Vice President and General Manager of New Jersey Operations David Seifert, attributed the following to the project: “We increased manufacturing efficiency and capacity which enabled us to grow the business.”
 

More than $600,000 increased sales due to increased manufacturing capacity and efficiency gains
4 new hires due to growth and new business associated with increased capacity and reduced costs.
More than $50,000 in cost savings due to gains in manufacturing efficiency.

In addition the company was also able to:

Reduce lead times
Minimize WIP
Improve productivity

The next Airborne Systems and NJMEP project is geared to a new product launch.  When NJMEP Field Agent Karen Evanko conducted a QuickView Assessment prior to beginning this next project, Airborne Systems, when  compared with companies within its SIC code, ranked in the top quarter percentile in all categories in the 13 section survey.
Dave Seifert, Vice President and General Manager, Airborne Systems New Jersey Operations. explained, “We continue to work with NJMEP, as a great provider of lean resources, to provide training for our people and to continue to improve our operations.”

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement. These popular supplements come in a wide variety of forms: pills, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, drinks (liquids and powders) and more. With so many options, it should be easy to find one that works for you. Vegetarians and vegans If you're a vegetarian, you may have deficiencies in protein, vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, zinc, iodine, riboflavin, calcium and selenium. Vegans are especially likely to be low in protein, selenium and B12. In addition to a multivitamin and mineral supplement, you might want to consider adding a vegan-friendly protein shake or two to your daily regimen. There are a wide variety of shake powders on the market, typically available in, but not limited to, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors. One scoop of protein powder usually provides approximately 25 grams of protein, but it varies from one supplier to another. Macrobiotic diet If you're on a macrobiotic diet, which is fixed on ideas about the types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D and other nutrients. The goal as a macrobiotic is to bring enlightenment, or healthy well-being, by teaching you how to thoughtfully choose what you eat. But it may come at a cost of some important vitamins. As with vegetarians and vegans, consider a solid multivitamin as a nutritional supplement. More support for seniors Seniors living in their own homes are often deficient in vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium and zinc and occasionally vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Older adults need more calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bone health. Try three daily servings of vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. Other calcium-rich foods include fortified cereals and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables and canned fish. These are all great additions to your daily meals, but be sure to take a multivitamin with age-adjusted doses of nutrients for people aged 50 years and older. Workout warriors For those who like to workout with weights, supplements can aid the recovery process and build muscle. Strength training on a regular basis breaks down your muscles so they can grow back bigger and stronger. Be sure to have a solid meal plan, get plenty of rest between workouts, lots of water and consider a protein supplement in the form of powders that can be mixed or protein bars. You can also add creatine to help build muscle and a variety of other workout supplements to assist with your fitness goals. At Walmart, you'll find a wide selection of vitamins and other supplements to help you keep up with your nutritional needs. Save money.
