CEO Message



A Message from Our CEO
Since its founding in 2005, Bridgepoint Education has been committed to serving the communities in which we live and work. As an organization, we have formed lasting relationships with community partners so that we can harness our collective energies to make meaningful contributions, particularly in our key areas of focus. Together, we are expanding educational opportunities, helping children thrive, and supporting our nation’s service members and their families.
At the heart of all our corporate citizenship efforts are our employees and students. They not only spend hours each year devoting their time and resources to causes that are important to them, they also come together to represent Bridgepoint Education in local volunteer efforts. In 2016, our employees donated nearly 20,500 hours to volunteer service and more than $120,000 to local charities through our United Way workplace campaign. And, as we do every year, we recognized National Volunteer Month in April with a company-wide Heroes Day: 

In San Diego, our Heroes and students helped revive an open space preserve by planting 400 California sunflowers.
In Clinton, Heroes and students helped their city stay beautiful by cleaning up trash along a parkway.
And in Denver, Heroes and students painted and gardened to help rejuvenate an elementary school.

In addition, our employees donated 460 backpacks filled with school supplies to a Title I school in San Diego, and 82 Bridgepoint Education employees volunteered in classrooms and taught Junior Achievement curriculum through our JA Teach Day program.
As always, we thank you for supporting our efforts to create a better community, a better country, and a better world. 
Sincerely,
Andrew Clark, CEO
        Bridgepoint Education

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
