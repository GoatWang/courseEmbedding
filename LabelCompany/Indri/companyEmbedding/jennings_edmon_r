Selling Growth Drug for Children: The Legal and Ethical Questions


By GINA KOLATA


Published: August 15, 1994









                    The companies that make and market a genetically engineered drug face charges that they have crossed legal and ethical lines in promoting their product, in the process tainting trusted relationships between doctors and patients, and parents and school systems.        

                    The drug is Protropin, a genetically engineered version of human growth hormone made by Genentech Inc. that can make some short children grow taller than they otherwise would. A Federal grand jury in Minneapolis this month indicted a doctor, David R. Brown of Minneapolis, on charges that he had received $1.1 million in kickbacks to prescribe the drug.        

                    The grand jury also indicted Edmon R. Jennings, the vice president for sales and marketing at Genentech, as well as the company that distributes the drug, Caremark Inc., and three of its officials.        

                    A House subcommittee led by Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, is also investigating marketing practices by Genentech and Caremark, including payments for surveys to find short children in schools. This practice may be funneling children to doctors who would treat them with Protropin, Mr. Wyden said.        

                    The drug, which costs $20,000 to $40,000 a year or more, is approved for the treatment of children whose bodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone and thus are destined to be very short.  But once a drug is on the market, doctors can prescribe it for other conditions at their discretion.        

                    Many medical experts say they have long been concerned that children who have a normal amount of human growth hormone and no medical problems but are simply short are being given the drug despite a lack of convincing evidence that it increases their final adult height. It is not know if Dr. Brown prescribed the drug for any children who had the normal amount of the hormone, but he was one of the most frequent prescribers of the drug in the country with 350 patients receiving the treatment.        

                    Fran Price, the executive director of the Human Growth Foundation, a nonprofit group that works with people with growth problems and is financed mainly by the two companies, said a recently published study concluded that 20,000 children were considered medically eligible for the therapy because they have insufficient human growth hormone.        

                    Genentech says about 15,000 children a year take its drug; thousands of other children take Humantrope, a nearly identical drug made by Eli Lilly & Company.        

                    The 51-count indictment says the payments to Dr. Brown were made by Genentech, of South San Francisco, and by Caremark of Northbrook, Ill.        

                    Joseph Duffy, a Chicago lawyer who is representing Dr. Brown, said that Dr. Brown emphatically denied the accusations against him and that the money he had received was for research and consulting. "There was nothing untoward or illegal about it," Mr. Duffy said.        

                    Jim Weiss, a Genentech spokesman, said the company stood behind Mr. Jennings: "Genentech was not named in this indictment. These are allegations. There is not anything proven."        

                    Caremark, in a prepared statement, said it "absolutely denies any wrongdoing and believes it will be vindicated when the facts are evaluated in an unbiased form."  Further Inquiry Under Way        

                    An official at the Department of Health and Human Services, who insisted on anonymity, and Steve Jennings, a staff member for Representative Wyden, say a Federal investigation is under way to determine whether other doctors around the country received money from the companies and if any did, under what circumstances.        

                    Mr. Wyden, chairman of the House subcommittee on regulation and technology, plans to hold hearings on the marketing of the drug within 60 days.        

                    Almost as soon as Protropin was approved for sale in 1985 it became a critical product for Genentech. The drug has sales of $217 million a year, more than a third of the company's total revenue, Mr. Weiss said.        

                    But as the drug's sales took off, some pediatricians and medical ethicists began asking whether it was being overpromoted as a sort of cosmetic endocrinology in attempts to make normal, but short, children grow. So who were the 15,000 children taking the Genentech drug? And why were so many taking Protropin rather than the Eli Lilly version, Humantrope?        

                    The two drugs have the same wholesale price, but Protropin may cost patients substantially more. Its sole distributor is Caremark, which charges a variety of prices, said Robert Campbell, a senior analyst at the Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company in Des Moines. Mr. Campbell, who reviews charges for the drugs, said Protropin cost on average 30 percent more than Humantrope.        

                    In the indictment, the grand jury charged that there was a conspiracy involving Dr. Brown, Caremark and its officials and Mr. Jennings of Genentech to defraud the Federal Medicaid program through a kickback scheme intended to sell Protropin.  Dr. Brown's patients included children on Medicaid.  What the Indictment Said        

                    The indictment gave this account:        

                    The conspiracy began when Mr. Jennings of Genentech wrote Dr. Brown a letter dated Feb. 5, 1986, "agreeing to explore Brown's desire to become involved with Genentech 'in a very significant way.' "

Ed Jennings Cleared of All Charges Judge Acquits Genentech Employee on Charges of Violating Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Remuneration Laws
 South San Francisco, Calif. -- October 3, 1995 --                     Edmon R. Jennings, vice president of Sales and Marketing at Genentech, was acquitted of all charges related to the federal Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Remuneration trial in Minneapolis.  The three Caremark employees, who were also on trial in this case, were acquitted.  The trial began in August 1995.
At the conclusion of the prosecution's case and prior to the presentation of the defense, Judge David R. Doty concluded that the government had failed to show any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Jennings.
Genentech considers Ed to be a highly valued executive who has contributed a great deal to the organization.  The company is delighted that he has been vindicated.  Ed will be returning to Genentech.
Jennings, who is 48, has been with Genentech for nine years.
