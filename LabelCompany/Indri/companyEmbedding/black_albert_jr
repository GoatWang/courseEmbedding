Early life[edit]
Black was born in 1959, the youngest of seven children and raised in the Frazier Courts housing projects in South Dallas. As a doorman at a hotel in downtown Dallas, his father, Albert Black Sr., came to know influential city business leaders who would regularly meet with the Chamber of Commerce. After work, Black Sr. would return home and explain to his son how these men would determine which individuals would hold powerful positions within the city. He would tell Black Jr., “I want my boy to be like those men running the city.” Hearing these words were Black's initial inspiration to become an entrepreneur, nonprofit volunteer, and civic leader.[5][6]
Black began his business career at age ten, when he and his friends borrowed a lawn mower and started Best Friends Lawn Service,[7] charging $2 per lawn, and eventually becoming "the first in the neighborhood to get a power mower."[8]
During this time, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty began. Government service trucks made stops to the projects Black resided in to deliver free lunches to the low-income area. Black, however, refused to participate in this program. He later was quoted as saying, "I distinctly remember how much disdain I had for the free-lunch program, I would have my own lunch instead. Welfare has a place, but it’s a poor substitute for gainful employment. One is loaded with ambition, and the other is not."[6]
He attended high school in the Dallas Independent School District and after graduation, he continued his studies at the University of Texas at Dallas,[9] graduating with a Bachelor's Degree of General Studies with a focus on business and political science. Following the completion of his studies at UTD, he enrolled at Southern Methodist University where he received an M.B.A. from the Cox School of Business.[citation needed]
On-Target Supplies & Logistics[edit]
Black co-founded On-Target Supplies & Logistics in 1982 as janitorial supplies distribution company.[10] When the business was slow to take off, Albert got a night job in the information systems department at Texas Utilities in order to fund his company. For ten years he worked his own business from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM, then went to his job from 5:00 PM – 2:00 AM.[11] He guided the company from a two-person start-up to a growing operation with 190 employees that has expanded to offer outsourced logistic solutions, supply chain management, and value-added reselling. On-Target’s central offices are located in southern Dallas with additional logistics operations throughout Dallas / Fort Worth, Sherman, Texas, Houston, Texas, and Tucson, AZ.[citation needed]
ReadyToWork[edit]
In 2006, Black launched ReadyToWork, On-Target's professional development service.[12] ReadyToWork offers staffing, career training, work readiness, available training space and training resources to its clients.
OTSL Charities[edit]
In 2006, Black established On-Target's social service arm, OTSL Charities, which donates time and resources to local area communities. OTSL Charities participates with other local charities to give back to the community, including helping Habitat for Humanity build houses, raising money for the March of Dimes and volunteering with at-risk students at the Texans Can! Academy.[citation needed]
Volunteerism and civic duty[edit]
In addition to being an entrepreneur, Black is also active in public service, civic duty and social volunteerism.
He has served as a Trustee and became Chairman of the Baylor Health Care System of Dallas in 2010, an Advisory Board of Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business, and a Regent for Baylor University-Waco.
Black has previously served on various boards including: Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce, Chase Bank of Texas, Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University, and Paul Quinn College.[13] In 1997, former Governor George W. Bush appointed Black to serve on the Board of Regents of Texas Southern University in Houston.[14] In 2000, Black served as the first African-American Chairman of the Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce's Board of Directors.
Black serves as the Treasurer for Texas State Senator Royce West,[6] Judge John Creuzot,[15] and Mayor Tom Leppert of Dallas.[16]
Black is a member of Omega Psi Phi, a national public service fraternity.[3]
He is a member of New Hope Baptist Church. His wife Gwyneith is the Executive Director of OTSL Charities. His children Oliver Victor Black, Albert C. Black, III (Tre’) and Cora René Black are discerning advisors and his most precious assets. The family enjoys traveling, hiking, and spending secluded time together on Lake Cypress Springs.[citation needed]

Early life[edit]
Black was born in 1959, the youngest of seven children and raised in the Frazier Courts housing projects in South Dallas. As a doorman at a hotel in downtown Dallas, his father, Albert Black Sr., came to know influential city business leaders who would regularly meet with the Chamber of Commerce. After work, Black Sr. would return home and explain to his son how these men would determine which individuals would hold powerful positions within the city. He would tell Black Jr., “I want my boy to be like those men running the city.” Hearing these words were Black's initial inspiration to become an entrepreneur, nonprofit volunteer, and civic leader.[5][6]
Black began his business career at age ten, when he and his friends borrowed a lawn mower and started Best Friends Lawn Service,[7] charging $2 per lawn, and eventually becoming "the first in the neighborhood to get a power mower."[8]
During this time, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty began. Government service trucks made stops to the projects Black resided in to deliver free lunches to the low-income area. Black, however, refused to participate in this program. He later was quoted as saying, "I distinctly remember how much disdain I had for the free-lunch program, I would have my own lunch instead. Welfare has a place, but it’s a poor substitute for gainful employment. One is loaded with ambition, and the other is not."[6]
He attended high school in the Dallas Independent School District and after graduation, he continued his studies at the University of Texas at Dallas,[9] graduating with a Bachelor's Degree of General Studies with a focus on business and political science. Following the completion of his studies at UTD, he enrolled at Southern Methodist University where he received an M.B.A. from the Cox School of Business.[citation needed]
On-Target Supplies & Logistics[edit]
Black co-founded On-Target Supplies & Logistics in 1982 as janitorial supplies distribution company.[10] When the business was slow to take off, Albert got a night job in the information systems department at Texas Utilities in order to fund his company. For ten years he worked his own business from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM, then went to his job from 5:00 PM – 2:00 AM.[11] He guided the company from a two-person start-up to a growing operation with 190 employees that has expanded to offer outsourced logistic solutions, supply chain management, and value-added reselling. On-Target’s central offices are located in southern Dallas with additional logistics operations throughout Dallas / Fort Worth, Sherman, Texas, Houston, Texas, and Tucson, AZ.[citation needed]
ReadyToWork[edit]
In 2006, Black launched ReadyToWork, On-Target's professional development service.[12] ReadyToWork offers staffing, career training, work readiness, available training space and training resources to its clients.
OTSL Charities[edit]
In 2006, Black established On-Target's social service arm, OTSL Charities, which donates time and resources to local area communities. OTSL Charities participates with other local charities to give back to the community, including helping Habitat for Humanity build houses, raising money for the March of Dimes and volunteering with at-risk students at the Texans Can! Academy.[citation needed]
Volunteerism and civic duty[edit]
In addition to being an entrepreneur, Black is also active in public service, civic duty and social volunteerism.
He has served as a Trustee and became Chairman of the Baylor Health Care System of Dallas in 2010, an Advisory Board of Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business, and a Regent for Baylor University-Waco.
Black has previously served on various boards including: Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce, Chase Bank of Texas, Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University, and Paul Quinn College.[13] In 1997, former Governor George W. Bush appointed Black to serve on the Board of Regents of Texas Southern University in Houston.[14] In 2000, Black served as the first African-American Chairman of the Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce's Board of Directors.
Black serves as the Treasurer for Texas State Senator Royce West,[6] Judge John Creuzot,[15] and Mayor Tom Leppert of Dallas.[16]
Black is a member of Omega Psi Phi, a national public service fraternity.[3]
He is a member of New Hope Baptist Church. His wife Gwyneith is the Executive Director of OTSL Charities. His children Oliver Victor Black, Albert C. Black, III (Tre’) and Cora René Black are discerning advisors and his most precious assets. The family enjoys traveling, hiking, and spending secluded time together on Lake Cypress Springs.[citation needed]

About this book




 In this collection, black religious scholars and pastors whose expertise range from theology, ethics, and the psychology of religion, to preaching, religious aesthetics, and religious education, discuss the legacy of Albert B. Cleage Jr. and the idea of the Black Madonna and child. Easter Sunday, 2017 will mark the fifty year anniversary of Albert B. Cleage Jr.’s unveiling of a mural of the Black Madonna and child in his church in Detroit, Michigan. This unveiling symbolized a radical theological departure and disruption. The mural helped symbolically launch Black Christian Nationalism and influenced the Black Power movement in the United States. But fifty years later, what has been the lasting impact of this act of theological innovation?  What is the legacy of Cleage’s emphasis on the literal blackness of Jesus?  How has the idea of a Black Madonna and child informed notions of black womanhood, motherhood? LGBTQ communities?  How has Cleage’s theology influenced Christian education, Africana pastoral theology, and the Black Arts Movement? The contributors to this work discuss answers to these and many more questions.

This Far by Faith . Albert Cleage | PBS





























































































































































            During the 1960s, many religious leaders, led by Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, sharply criticized the methods and advances claimed by the civil rights movement. By far the most vocal Christian minister advocating a more radical approach to obtaining civil rights was Albert Cleage, Jr.  
            

            Albert Cleage was born in Indianapolis in 1911 and grew up in Detroit.  He received his B.A. from Wayne State in 1942 and his Bachelor of Divinity from Oberlin Graduate School of Theology in 1943.  Cleage was ordained in the Congregational Church in 1943.  
            

            After a brief-and disappointing-term as pastor at an integrated church in San Francisco, Cleage returned to Detroit in 1951 and served at St. Marks United Presbyterian mission.  He soon clashed with white Presbyterian leaders over issues of how he should lead his black congregation.  In 1953, Cleage and a group of followers left to form the Central Congregation Church.  They were committed to ministering to the downtrodden, and offered several programs for the community's poor.
            

            Throughout the 1960s, Cleage was active in issues of education and black political leadership.   By the late 1960s, his vision of Christianity had radicalized alongside the disappointments of the civil rights movement and rise of Black Power.  He launched the Black Christian National Movement in 1967, which called for black churches to reinterpret Jesus' teachings to suit the social, economic, and political needs of black people.  That Easter, Cleage unveiled an 18-foot painting of a Black Madonna, and renamed Central Congregational the Shrine of the Black Madonna. 
            

            In 1968, following a year of racial unrest in Detroit, Cleage published The Black Messiah, which detailed his vision of Jesus as a black revolutionary leader.  In 1972, he published his second book, Black Christian Nationalism, and inaugurated the Black Christian Nationalist Movement as a separate denomination.  The name was later changed to the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church (PAOCC), and Cleage changed his own name to Jaramogi Abebe Agyeman, meaning "liberator, holy man, savior of the nation" in Swahili.  The PAOCC includes churches in Atlanta, GA, and Houston, TX, several cultural centers, bookstores, community service centers, and a working farm.
            

            Jaramogi Abebe Agyeman died on February 20, 2000.  The PAOCC continues his mission to uplift and liberate the Pan African world community through the teachings of Jesus, the Black Messiah.
            

















KEY MOMENTS OF FAITH








            CHILDHOOD INFLUENCES
            

            Cleage's father was a pioneering black physician, and their social class gave them access to Detroit's black aristocracy.  But even as a boy, Cleage was affected by Detroit's labor and civil rights struggles and gravitated toward issues of social justice.
            

            AN INTERRACIAL FELLOWSHIP FAILED
            

            Cleage was ordained in the Congregational Church in 1943, and became interim pastor at the newly-organized, integrated San Francisco Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. One of the founders of the Fellowship Church was black theologian Howard Thurman.  Cleage was originally committed to interracial fellowship, but when he saw the social inequality among the congregation, especially the Japanese-American members who had been forcibly removed from their homes and placed in interment camps, he grew critical.  He called the church a "contrived, artificial affair" that did not address racial inequalities of power and property.
            

            AN INDEPENDENT DENOMINATION
            

            In 1951, Cleage returned to Detroit to serve at St. Mark's United Presbyterian mission, whose founders included his father and uncle. Despite initially feeling at home at St. Marks, Cleage quickly came into conflict with the rigid Presbyterian hierarchy.  He resented that white leaders in the suburbs could tell him how to run his black inner-city congregation, and in 1953 he led "a group of dissidents out of the church."  In this respect, Cleage was a decade ahead of black Presbyterians and Congregationalists who would later demand freedom to make changes to suit the needs of their congregations.
            

            BLACK ARTS CONFERENCE
            

            Stokely Carmichael called for black power in the summer of 1966, the same year Cleage held the First Annual Black Arts Conference at Central Congregational, the church Cleage founded after leaving St. Mark's.  The conference was his answer to the Nation of Islam's call for blacks to "find beauty in their own identity and culture."
            

            THE SHRINE OF THE BLACK MADONNA
            

            On Easter of 1967, Cleage unveiled an 18-foot painting of a Black Madonna, and renamed Central Congregational as the Shrine of the Black Madonna. 
            

            At the same time, he launched a Black Christian National Movement, which called for black churches to reinterpret Jesus' teachings.  Believing that Christianity previously had been used to keep black people down, Cleage challenged black churches to embrace Jesus as "a revolutionary black leader, a Zealot, seeking to lead a Black Nation to freedom."  Central to this belief was resurrecting the "historical black Messiah."  Cleage wanted to "dehonkify" Jesus for black Christians.
            

            THE BLACK MESSIAH
            

            In 1968, Cleage published The Black Messiah, which included several sermons and articles published in his weekly column, "Message to the Black Nation," in the Michigan Chronicle.   He also spread his views through participation in the Inter-Religious Foundation for Community Organization and the National Black Economic Development Conference.
            

            The Pan African Orthodox Christian ChurchIn 1972, Cleage inaugurated the Black Christian Nationalist Movement as a separate denomination.  The name was later changed to the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church (PAOCC). In 1975, a Southern Region of the PAOCC was established in Atlanta, GA, followed by the Southwest Region in Houston, TX, in 1977. The PAOCC's mission, which still continues after Cleage's death, is to uplift, empower, and liberate the Pan African world community and to "bring the Black Church back to its historic roots-The African origins of Christianity and the original teachings of Jesus, the Black Messiah."

Richard Albert Mohler Jr. is an American evangelical theologian and the president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He has been recognized by Time and Christianity Today as a leader among American evangelicals. Dr. Mohler hosts The Albert Mohler Program, a daily nationwide radio show, and writes a popular blog and a regular commentary on moral, cultural, and theological issues.
Mohler’s aim is to address contemporary issues from a consistent and explicit Christian worldview. Widely sought as a columnist and commentator, Dr. Mohler has been quoted in the nation’s leading newspapers, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and The Washington Post, and has appeared on national news programs.
A native of Lakeland, Florida, Dr. Mohler was a faculty scholar at Florida Atlantic University before receiving his BA from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. He holds an MDiv and PhD (in systematic and historical theology) from Southern Seminary. He has pursued additional study at the St. Meinrad School of Theology and has done research at Oxford University. Dr. Mohler also serves as the Joseph Emerson Brown Professor of Christian Theology at Southern Seminary.
His writings have been published throughout the United States and Europe. In addition to contributing to a number of collected volumes, he is the author of several books, including Culture Shift: Engaging Current Issues with Timeless Truth, Desire & Deceit: The Real Cost of the New Sexual Tolerance, Atheism Remix: A Christian Confronts the New Atheists, He Is Not Silent: Preaching in a Postmodern World, and the forthcoming The Disappearance of God: Dangerous Beliefs in the New Spiritual Openness.
