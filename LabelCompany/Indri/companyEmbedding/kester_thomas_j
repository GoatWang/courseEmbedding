Alloys

Alloy Temperature Chart
This chart lists the alloys that are available from Kester. Along with the alloys the alloy melting temperature or plastic range is listed. Also listed for each alloy are the forms it is available in.


Alloy Properties
Strength properties of some of the more common alloys. Shear strength, tensile strength and density values for some of the common alloys. Additional alloy properties including information on conductivity, brinell, hardness, elastic modulus, surface tension.

2% Silver
When a silver alloy is recommended. The 2% silver is required when soldering to silver or silver plated components/leads. The small percent of silver in the solder prevents the silver on the leads from migrating into the solder resulting in a weak or brittle solder connection.

Dross
What is dross? Dross is an oxide that is formed of the tin and lead in the solder. Dross is generated by a combination of heat and agitation. The hotter the solder pot is, the faster the dross is generated. Also, the more agitation the solder sees, the more dross will be formed. A nitrogen blanket will prevent oxygen from reaching the surface of the solder and the dross generation will be greatly diminished or eliminated. There are also chemical dross reducing agents such as the Kester #5744 Dross Eliminator. These chemical compounds react with the tin and lead oxides reducing them back to the base metal and releasing the oxygen to the air. Follow the instructions on the Product Data Sheet when using chemical reducing agents.

Sn60 vs. Sn63
When is the use of one of these two alloys more appropriate than the other? The Sn60Pb40 has a plastic range and puts down a slightly thicker coating of solder. Sn60 is often preferred for lead tinning and other solder coating applications. Sn63Pb37 is eutectic and as such has no plastic range. Generally it flows better than the Sn60 and is the preferred alloy for wave soldering and surface mount applications.

Gold Colored Solder
Assemblers are often concerned when they see a gold color on the surface of a solder pot. The gold color is tin oxide. When the surface of the molten solder is exposed to air it oxidizes and turns gold; sometimes the tin oxide is a purple-blue color. This is normal and can only be prevented by using an anti-oxidant powder or pellet. The discoloration is a cosmetic defect and in no way degrades the reliability of the solder. Kester offers the #5744 Dross eliminator for this purpose.

Flux Residue Removal
Removing No-Clean Flux Residues
Suggestions of how to remove the residues from no-clean fluxes: To remove the residues of no-clean fluxes most solvents will work. The best results are achieved by removing the residues in an aqueous spray cleaner. The spray cleaner can be either a batch type or an in-line type. The addition of a saponifier (Kester # 5768) and hot water, about 130°F will completely remove the flux residues.

Removing Organic Acid (OA) Flux Residues
It is required to remove the residues of OA fluxes? You will get corrosion if you do not fully remove all the flux residues. The flux residues from organic fluxes are hygroscopic, they contain organic acids and they may contain halides. Over time the residues will absorb moisture and the halides will become mobile and corrosive. This will lead to ‘catastrophic failure’ of the assembly in question. We recommend cleaning with an aqueous cleaning system, it can be either batch type or in-line. The water temperature should be between 120-140°F. The important thing is to have lots of rinsing and flushing to completely remove all the flux residues.

Flux Thinning
Soldering fluxes loose solvent and need additions of thinner. Flux is composed of solids dissolved in a solvent base. Over time the solvent evaporates. As the solvent evaporates the solids concentrate and eventually crystallize out. You will need to add thinner on a regular basis to prevent the flux from crystallizing. A hydrometer is used to measure the specific gravity of the flux. Normally the specific gravity (density) is checked 2 or 3 times a day. Thinner is then added to return the flux to its correct density. Hydrometers can be purchased from any scientific supply house. Kester has flux density control Data Sheets (also called nomographs) for the rosin and higher solid content fluxes. Using the nomograph you can determine how much thinner needs to be added. We sell test kits for the low residue fluxes. The test kits indicate how much thinner to add to the flux pot.

What Does No-Clean Mean?
There is some apprehension at the description, ‘no-clean’. What does it mean? The flux category called “no-clean” . Many fluxes fall into this category because the flux residues are not harmful to assemblies. It does not mean there will be no residues. All fluxes leave residues (the solids are the active portion of the flux that does all the work). Some flux residues are conductive or corrosive and must be removed. Other fluxes like the no-clean fluxes leave residues that do not need to be removed.

Flux Test Kit
The PS-20 and PS-22 test kits are used for flux control of low residue(no-clean) fluxes. The PS-20 and PS-22 test kits are acid titration kits. As solvent evaporates, the acids in the flux become more and more concentrated. The kit is used to determine the acid number of the flux. The test is a simple drop test with an indicator for the endpoint (similar to a swimming pool test). You count the drops and then go to a chart. From the chart you determine how much thinner to add to bring the acid number back down to spec. Traditionally flux control is maintained by measuring the density of the flux and adding thinner as the flux thickens. This is a good method for fluxes with high solids contents. A slight change in density corresponds to a small change in the flux. The no-clean fluxes have low solids percents (typically 2 or 3 %) so a small change in the flux density could reflect the change in solids of 25-30%. This would put the acid level unacceptably high. The test kits are more accurate than using density measurements as a way to monitor the flux.

Rosin Flux
Saponification
Saponifiers in an aqueous cleaner can be used to remove rosin flux residues. What the Bio-Kleen #5768 saponifier does is react with the outside layer of flux and soften it up, lLiterally turning it into a soap. You need a spray cleaner so that this soap layer will be washed away which then allows the Bio-Kleen to react with the next layer. Rinse that layer off, etc. The problem with ultrasonic removal is that the outer layer is slightly dissolved and that is the end of the reaction. In the meantime the solder is being exposed to an alkaline condition. The exposed solder turns a dull gray as the surface shine is etched off by the caustic solution.

Thinner Calculation
A calculation that can be used to determine how much thinner needs to be added to the flux to maintain a specified specific gravity. The following formula can be used to determine how much Kester # 4662 thinner to add to the Kester # 2235 flux to bring it back to the recommended specific gravity (density). For your information this formula can be used for any Kester flux that utilizes the # 4662 thinner. V = ( x – y ) 128 Y – 0.783 Where V = ounces of # 4662 thinner to be added per gallon of flux. X = present flux density Y = desired flux density For example: The flux is at 0.875 and it should be at 0.856 V = ( 0.875-0.856 ) 128 or V = 2.432 or V = 33.3 ounces of thinner per gallon of flux 0.856 – 0.783 .073

Storage of Flammable Materials
Most rosin fluxes are flammable materials. This is a general guide to storage of flammable materials. Kester does not have a required temperature and humidity for storage of flammable liquid chemicals. From a safety standpoint we recommend storage at room temperature and humidity. For flammable materials we recommend storage in an approved flammable materials storage cabinet. Storage above normal room temperature can be risky as the material (alcohol) will build up pressure in the container. There is a risk the material will spew out of the container when opened.

Soldering fluxes lose solvent and need additions of thinner. Flux is composed of solids dissolved in a solvent base. Over time the solvent evaporates. As the solvent evaporates the solids concentrate and eventually crystallize out. You will need to add thinner on a regular basis to prevent the flux from crystallizing.

We sell test kits for the low residue fluxes. The test kits indicate how much thinner to add to the flux pot.

Rosin Flux Removal
Do rosin flux residues need to be removed? Rosin flux residues are non-conductive and non-corrosive. Under normal circumstances they do not have to be removed from a printed circuit assembly. Rosin residue removal would be for cosmetic considerations. In an environment where the working temperature of the assembly will exceed 200°F the rosin residues will melt and become conductive, in these situations flux removal is required.

All fluxes leave residues (the solids are the active portion of the flux that does all the work). Some flux residues are conductive or corrosive and must be removed. Other fluxes like the no-clean fluxes leave residues that do not need to be removed.

Organic Acid (Water-Soluble) Solder Paste
It is required to remove the residues of OA fluxes? You will get corrosion if you do not fully remove all the flux residues. The flux residues from organic fluxes are hygroscopic, they contain organic acids and they may contain halides. Over time the residues will absorb moisture and the halides will become mobile and corrosive. This will lead to ‘catastrophic failure’ of the assembly in question. We recommend cleaning with an aqueous cleaning system, it can be either batch type or in-line. The water temperature should be between 120-140°F. The important thing is to have lots of rinsing and flushing to completely remove all the flux residues.

Process Information
Syringable Paste Needle Size
Syringable solder paste requires a needle and plunger for application.  The 100 g paste comes in a standard 30cc. syringe. 35 g samples come in a standard 10 cc syringe. Most distributors carry plungers and needles. Scientific supply companies such as Fisher Scientific (www.fishersci.com) and Cole Parmer (www.coleparmer.com) also carry plungers and needles. For dispensing SMT solder paste a 20 gauge needle is the smallest that is usable.

Solderability

Soldering to gold
When soldering to a gold plated surface the thickness of the gold is important. If the gold is thicker than 40-50 micro-inches, the solder most likely may not dissolve all the gold and bond to it. The solder will be dull looking and, if the gold content in the solder exceeds about 5%, the solder joint will be brittle. If the gold is thin, less than 20 micro-inches, it easily dissolves into the solder, making the solder joint look grainy. If the metal that was under the gold is not oxidized, the gold-contaminated solder will bond to it. However, as gold plates usually in a columnar structure, the gold should be at least 10 micro-inches thick to protect the base metal (in most cases nickel) from oxidation.

Soldering to stainless steel
Stainless steel is a difficult metal to solder to.
Download Article

2% Silver
When is a silver alloy is recommended? The 2% silver is required when soldering to silver or silver plated components/leads. The small percent of silver in the solder prevents the silver on the leads from migrating into the solder resulting in a weak or brittle solder connection.

Soldering to Aluminum
Aluminum is an extremely difficult metal to solder to. Kester does not have any products for soldering to aluminum.

Soldering Thermocouple Wires
Thermocouple materials are not solderable. It is possible to surround the thermocouple wire (encapsulate it) with solder but you cannot make a metallurgical bond to it. It is important to note that even if you could solder the two wires back together the thermocouple still will not work. A thermocouple works by measuring the change in resistance of the two dissimilar metals joined in the welded bead. If one were to join the metals with a solder inter-connect the thermocouple would give meaningless numbers. The way to fix a broken thermocouple is to re-weld the thermocouple bead. If you wish to attach a thermocouple to a printed circuit board for reflow profiling, you can use a high temperature alloy to encapsulate it or use a cyano-acrylate adhesive to stick it to the board.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
