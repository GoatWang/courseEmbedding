Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Melodramatic Imagination: Balzac, Henry James, Melodrama, And The Mode Of Excessby Brooks, PeterIn this lucid and fascinating book, Peter Brooks argues that melodrama is a crucial mode of expression in modern literature. After studying stage melodrama as a dominant popular form in the nineteenth century, he moves on to Balzac and Henry James to show how these "realist" novelists created fiction using the rhetoric and excess of melodrama - in particular its secularized conflicts of good and evil, salvation and damnation. The Melodramatic Imagination has become a classic work for understanding theater, fiction, and film.Creative AbilityCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum

 (Virgil, Aeneid, 3:658) 


{199} Viewing woman's body in a phallic field of vision
predominates in the nineteenth-century realist tradition, but
there are examples of attempts to subvert this model and move
beyond its epistemological implications to other kinds of
knowing of the body. I shall argue in the next chapter that
George Eliot provides the best instance of dissent from within
the dominant tradition -- a dissent that Freud, attempting to
supplant seeing by listening to the body, may also be struggling
toward. The present chapter returns to an earlier example of the
dissenting perspective, by another woman novelist, written
before the realist novel has established its hegemony -- Mary
Shelley's Frankenstein. Hence I propose here to violate
chronology, and to interrupt the general trend of my argument,
to look closely at a text which is too complex, peculiar, and
interesting to be neglected.
Frankenstein, first published in 1818, concerns an exotic
body with a difference, a distinct perversion from the tradition
of desirable objects. The story of this ugly, larger-than-life,
monstrous body raises complex questions of motherhood,
fatherhood, gender, and narrative. The afterlife of the novel in
the popular imagination has been intensely focused on that
monstrous body, to the extent that the name "Frankenstein" tends
to evoke not the unfortunate overreaching young scientist Victor
Frankenstein but his hideous creation. This is both faithful
and unfaithful to Mary Shelley's original: faithful, in that a
monster indeed, even etymologically, exists to be looked at,
shown off, viewed as in a circus sideshow; unfaithful, in that
Shelley's novel with equal insistence directs us to issues of
language in the story of the monster and his creator. In fact,
the central issues of the novel are joined in the opposition of
sight {200} and speech, and it unfolds its complex narrative
structure from this nexus.


That narrative structure
involves framed or imbedded tales, a tale within a tale within a
tale: in the outer frame, explorer Robert Walton writes to his
sister Mrs Saville, and tells of meeting Frankenstein in the
Arctic; in the next frame, Frankenstein recounts his life story
to Walton; in the innermost tale, the monster at a crucial
moment tells his tale to Frankenstein. When the monster has
finished, Frankenstein resumes speaking in his own right; when
he has done, Walton resumes.1 The nested narrative structure
calls attention to the presence of a listener for each speaker
-- of a narratee for each narrator -- and to the
interlocutionary relations thus established. Each act of
narration in the novel implies a certain bond or contract:
listen to me because . . . The structure calls
attention to the motives of telling; it makes each listener --
and the reader -- ask: Why are you telling me this? What am I
supposed to do with it? As in the psychoanalytic context of
storytelling, the listener is placed in a transferential
relation to the narrative. As a "subject supposed to know," the
listener is called upon to "supplement" the story (to anticipate
the phrase Freud will use in the case history of Dora), to
articulate and even enact the meaning of the desire it expresses
in ways that may be foreclosed to the speaker. Storytelling in
Frankenstein is far from an innocent act: narratives
have designs on their narratees that must he unravelled. The
issues posed by such a narrative structure may most of all
concern relation, or how narrative relation relates to
intersubjective relation, and the relation of relation, in both
these senses, to language as the medium of telling and
listening, as the medium of transmission, transaction, and
transference.


These issues take on their full import only in the context of
the visual. I shall start with the opening of the innermost tale
-- which strikingly poses the issues of the visual -- and then
work out to the framing structures. Following the first murders
committed by the Monster -- Frankenstein's brother William
strangled, the family servant Justine Moritz executed as his
killer through maliciously planted evidence -- Frankenstein
seeks solace in the Alps above Chamonix. He penetrates the
"glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature," climbing to Montanvert and the Mer de Glace, hoping to recapture a
remembered "sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and
allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy."2 His ascension
takes him to a "wonderful and stupendous scene," overlooking the
Mer de Glace and facing the "awful majesty" of Mont Blanc; his heart once
again opens to joy, {201} and he exclaims, in the tones of the
Ossianic bard, "Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do
not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or
take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life." At this
point, the vision of sublimity is both fulfilled
and undone by the sight of a superhuman shape that comes
bounding toward Frankenstein over the ice. The Monster appears
to be -- as in his original creation -- both born of nature and
supernatural, and as such he puts normal measurements and
classifications into question. In particular, he puts into
question the meaning of looking, of optics, as the faculty and
the science most commonly used to judge meanings in the
phenomenal world.


Frankenstein's immediate reaction to the appearance of the
Monster is to tell it to go away. When the Monster persists in
his claim that he has the right to a hearing from his creator,
Frankenstein curses the day of the Monster's creation, and
reiterates: "Begone! Believe me from the sight of your detested
form" (p. 97). To this the
Monster, in a touching gesture, responds by placing his huge
hands over Frankenstein's eyes: "Thus I relieve thee, my
creator
. . . thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.
Still thou canst listen to me, and grant me thy compassion." The
Monster clearly understands that it is not visual relation that
favours him -- indeed, as we will discover when he tells his own
story, his only favourable reception from a human being thus far
has come from the blind de Lacey -- but rather the auditory or
interlocutionary, the relation of language. Thus, this first
meeting of Frankenstein and his Monster since the day of his
creation presents a crucial issue of the novel in the opposition
of sight and language, of the hideous body and the persuasive
tongue.


For the Monster is eloquent. From the first words he speaks, he
shows himself to be a supreme rhetorician, who controls the
antitheses and oxymorons that express the pathos of his
existence: "Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy
Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from
joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone
am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made
me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous" (pp. 95-96). When we learn of
the Monster's self-education -- and particularly his three
mastertexts, Milton's Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and Goethe's Werther -- we will
understand the prime sources of his eloquence and of the
conception of the just order of things that animates his plea to
his creator. But beyond the motives of his eloquence, it is
important to register the simple fact of Shelley's decision to
make {202} the Monster the most eloquent creature in the novel.
This hideous and deformed creature, far from expressing himself
in grunts and gestures, speaks and reasons with the highest
elegance, logic, and persuasiveness. As a verbal creation, he is
the very opposite of the monstrous: he is a sympathetic and
persuasive participant in Western culture. All of the Monster's
interlocutors -- including, finally, the reader -- must come to
terms with this contradiction between the verbal and the
visual.3


By persuading Frankenstein to give his creature a hearing, thus
opening the innermost frame of the novel, the Monster has
adumbrated what Roland Barthes would call a "narrative contract"
between narrator and narratee.4 The narrative contract, like the
psychoanalytic transference, is based on and implies the
intersubjective, transindividual, cultural order of language.
Language by its very nature transcends and pre-exists the
individual locutor; it implies, depends on, and necessitates
that network of intersubjective relations from which the Monster
protests he has been excluded. That is, in becoming the
narrator of his story, the Monster both dramatises his problem
and provides a model for its solution, the solution implicit in
the discursive interdependence of an "I" and a "thou" in any
interlocutionary situation.5 The Monster's words assign to
Frankenstein a parental role for the first time in the novel:
"For the first time . . . I felt what the duties of a
creator towards his creature were" (p. 97) -- a role all the more
glaring in its neglect in that Frankenstein has dwelt at length
on the parental love and concern lavished on him in his early
years, the way he was guided by a "silken cord" toward happiness
and goodness (p. 33). By the
time the Monster has completed his narrative, Frankenstein still
feels horror and hatred when he looks upon this "filthy mass
that moved and talked," but he also avows: "His words had a
strange effect upon me. I compassionated him" (p. 140). After establishing this
tenuous link with his creator through narrative, the Monster
takes the decisive step in his argument: "My vices are the
children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I
shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked
to the chain of existence and events from which I am now
excluded" (pp. 140-41).


The metaphor of the chain is one that will reappear in various
guises throughout the novel. It represents relation itself,
including affective interpersonal relations (see the "silken
cord" of Frankenstein's childhood) and the relations between
tellers and listeners -- relations established through language
and as language. The chain here closely resembles what Jacques Lacan calls the
"signifying chain" of language, {203} especially language as the
vehicle of desire. In the Monster's confrontation of and
narrative to Frankenstein, we have a representation of the
Lacanian distinction between the imaginary and the symbolic
orders. The imaginary is the order of the specular, of the
mirror stage, and arises from the subject's perception of itself
as other; it is thus the order of deceptive relations, of
ideology and fascination. The symbolic order ultimately is
language itself, the systematic and transindividual order of the
signifier, the cultural system or law into which individual
subjects are inserted.6 In the specular or imaginary order,
the Monster will ever cease to be the "filthy mass." In the
symbolic order, on the other hand, he can produce and project
his desire in language, in relation to an interlocutor. It is,
however, in the logic of Lacanian desire and the "signifying
chain" that such desire should be unappeasable, a metonymical
movement that extends desire forward without reaching a goal: a
goal which cannot be named, since the object of desire is
unconscious. The Monster's stated object of desire is for a
mate, a female creature like himself, which Frankenstein must
create. But we will have occasion to ask whether this demand
truly corresponds to the needs stipulated by the Monster's
desire.


Before considering the Monster's demand for -- and
Frankenstein's temporary acquiescence to -- the creation of a
female monster, it is important to register the Monster's
narrative of his discovery of language, its contexts and its
effects. His first experience with humanity, he tells us,
already demonstrated the hopelessness of the specular relation:
the shepherd he discovered in a hut fled shrieking from his
sight, the villagers pelted him with stones. Retreating into a
hovel adjoining the de Lacey cottage, he commences his education
as voyeur, observing the family through an 'almost imperceptible
chink through which the eye could penetrate', seeing and himself
unseen. His most important discovery is that of human language,
which is presented in the context of human interaction and
affect:



"I found that these people possessed a method of communicating
their experience and feelings to one another by articulate
sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced
pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and
countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was
baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their
pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having
any apparent connection with visible {204} objects, I was unable
to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of
their reference. By great application, however, and after having
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in
my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the
most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the
words, 'fire,' 'milk,' 'bread,' and 'wood.' I learned also the
names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion
had each of them several names, but the old man had only one,
which was 'father.' The girl was called 'sister' or 'Agatha,'
and the youth 'Felix,' 'brother,' or 'son.' I cannot describe
the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each
of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished
several other words without being able as yet to understand or
apply them, such as 'good', 'dearest', 'unhappy.'" (pp. 106-107)



Like so much else in the story of the Monster's education
through sensation, experience, and the association of ideas, his
discovery of language stands within Enlightenment debates about
origins, coming in this instance close to the scenarios of Rousseau's Essai sur
l'origine des langues, which sees language as originating
not in need but in emotion.7 As the Monster encounters it,
language is tied to human love and patterns of kinship and
relation, as if in confirmation of the views of an
anthropologist such as Claude Lévi-Strauss, for whom the
structures of kinship are the first "writing" of a society. The
Monster also discovers the proto-Saussurian notion that the
linguistic sign is arbitrary, that there is no intuitable
connection of a sign to its referent, and indeed that some signs
("good," "dearest," "unhappy") have no apparent referent. As a
consequence, the Monster grasps the nature of language as a
system, wherein meaning is created not as a simple movement from
sign to referent but in context, dependent on the rule-governed
relation of signs one to another.


Hence language presents itself as both the tool he needs to
enter into relation with others, and a model of relation
itself: it implies -- it both depends on and makes possible --
that 'chain of existence and events' from which he feels himself
excluded. The "godlike science" of language is thus explicitly a
cultural compensation for a deficient nature; it offers the
possibility of escape from "monsterism," which is precisely lack
of relation, apartness. Language is what he must use to
experience human love. In Rousseau's terms, it is a "supplement"
to nature. The Monster tells Frankenstein: "I easily perceived
that, although I eagerly longed to {205} discover myself to the
cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first
become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me
to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this
also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me
acquainted' (p. 108).


Language is richly thematised at this moment of the novel. With
the arrival of Safie, we have lessons in French offered to an
Arab, in the context of what we know to be a German-speaking
region, the whole rendered for us in English. This well-ordered
Babel calls attention to issues of communication and
transmission, in somewhat the same manner as the narrative
frames of the novel. The Monster learns language through
overhearing, and observing, the instruction of Safie by Felix
and Agatha. He learns to read -- that is, he masters language in
what is for Rousseau its mediate form, supplementary to the
spoken word: the form in which it is most transmissible, since
it does not demand presence, the specular relation, for its
exchange, yet also the form in which it is potentially most
deceitful, freed from immediate expressivity. The three texts
which the Monster now discovers and reads -- Plutarch's Lives, Goethe's Werther, and Milton's Paradise Lost -- cover the
public, the private, and the cosmic realms, and three modes of
love. They constitute a kind of minimal Romantic cyclopedia
universalis. Of the three, it is Paradise Lost -- in
the literalist reading the Monster gives it -- that excite the
profoundest reactions, and poses in emblematic terms the enigma
of the Monster's nature. In the manner of Adam, he appears to be a unique
creation, "united by no link to any other being in existence"
(p. 124). Yet, "wretched,
helpless, and alone," he is unlike Adam. "Many times I
considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the
bitter gall of envy rose within me." In particular, the
intertextual presence of Paradise Lost insistently poses
the relation of language to the specular, especially in the
implicit comparison of the Monster to Eve, in two passages in which he
views himself in a mirroring pool. "I had admired the perfect
forms of my cottagers -- their grace, beauty, and delicate
complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a
transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe
that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I
became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I
am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence
and mortification (p. 108).
This echoes Eve's report of the day of her creation, in Book 4 (460-76) of Paradise
Lost. After first awakening to life, she finds a mirroring
lake:



{206} As I bent down to look, just opposite,

A Shape within the wat'ry gleam appear'd

Bending to look back on me, I started back,

It started back, but pleas'd I soon return'd,

Pleas'd it return'd as soon as answering looks

Of sympathy and love; there I had fixt

Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,

Had not a voice thus warn'd me, What thou seest,

What there thou seest fair Creature is thyself,

With thee it came and goes; but follow me,

And I will bring thee where no shadow stays

Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, hee

Whose image thou art, him thou shalt enjoy

Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear

Multitudes like thyself, and thence be call'd

Mother of human Race: what could I do,

But follow straight, invisibly thus led?



The passage of course recalls Ovid's Narcissus, and anticipates
Lacan's scenario of the infant's discovery of his reflected self
-- both same and other -- at the mirror stage. Narcissism is
here a temptation to which Eve, immediately enamoured of her own
image, would succumb, pining "with vain desire," were it not for
the intervention of a divine voice that commands her to set
aside this moment of primary narcissism in favour of sexual
difference. The place "where no shadow stays" is almost
explicitly the place of the phallus, as opposed to the
insubstantiality of the female's sex and the love of two female
bodies. As the Miltonic scenario unfolds, Eve's first perception
of Adam is not itself sufficient to move her beyond primary
narcissism: Adam is "fair indeed and tall," she says, "yet
methought less fair, / Less winning soft, less amiably mild, /
Than that smooth wat'ry image; back I turn'd" (4:478-80). She
would return to the "answering looks" of the lake were it not
that Adam at this point seizes her hand, and she yields to what
is for Milton, in his thoroughly misogynist scenario, the
explicit hegemony of the male.


Milton's story is thus about Eve's discovery of the law, which
is variously the command of God, the law of sexual difference,
and the rule of the phallus. In her submission to the law, she
gives up desire for her own image, and for indifferentiation,
with reluctance, in a prefiguration of her subsequent
disobedience. The Monster, on the other hand, discovers himself
as different, as violation of the law, in a scenario that {207}
mirrors and reverses Lacan's; the outer image -- that in the
mirror -- presents the body in its lack of wholeness (at least
in human terms) while the inner apprehension of the body had up
until then held it to be hypothetically whole: 'At first I
started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was
reflected in the mirror.' The experience is anti-narcissistic,
convincing the Monster that he is, indeed, a monster, thus in no
conceivable system an object of desire. As the Monster will put
it in the second passage of self-reflection, "Increase of
knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched
outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished
when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the
moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade"
(p. 125). The mirror image
becomes the negation of hope, severing the Monster from desire.
He is simply outside the law, and thus will require a separate
creation -- his own Eve -- in order to come under its sway. Thus
his narrative plea to his creator concludes by focusing the
discourse of desire on a new object to be desired, the monster
woman.


The Monster's self-reflections in relation to Paradise
Lost are succeeded by discovery of the literal story of his
creation, in Frankenstein's laboratory journal, which he finds
in the pocket of the coat he has worn since the day of his
creation. Here, he discovers that he is the anti-image of Adam:
"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even
from the very resemblance" (p.
125). Self-recognition as "filthy type" completes the
mirror stage of the Monster's development. He now knows he must
trust wholly in the symbolic order. Having mastered language, he
goes to confront the patriarch de Lacey. The "godlike science"
at first appears to achieve the desired effects: "I am blind,"
de Lacey responds to the Monster's plea, "and cannot judge of
your countenance, but there is something in your words which
persuades me that you are sincere" (p. 128). Sympathy is on the
point of creating the Monster's first entry into the social
chain, when Felix, Agatha, and Safie enter the cottage, and the
Monster is brutally returned to the specular order: Agatha
faints, Safie flees, and Felix violently separates the
interlocutors. The Monster in consequence becomes explicitly Satanic: "I, like the
arch-fiend, bore a hell within me" (p. 130); he sets fire to what
had late been his happy seat, and sets forth into the world in
search of the hidden face of his creator, the deus
absconditus who alone, now, has the power to bring him into
social relation, through a second monstrous creation.


Along the way to his meeting with Frankenstein, the Monster --
after {208} being shot and wounded by a rustic whose daughter he
has saved from drowning -- commits his first murder, that of
Frankenstein's brother William, in a scene that evokes the
question of relation in the most acute ways. The Monster's first
idea is to take the boy as a companion; in a common
Enlightenment thought experiment, he conceives that a child is
probably too young "to have imbibed a horror of deformity" (p. 136). His error is
immediately apparent: to his address of "Child," William in
return calls him "monster! Ugly wretch! . . . ogre."
But what provokes the murder is William's exclamation that his
father is "M. Frankenstein" -- Victor's father also, of course,
and by extrapolation the Monster's "grandfather" -- whom the
Monster here calls "my enemy." When William lies dead at his
feet, the Monster notices a miniature portrait worn around his
neck: "I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In
spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few
moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep
lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I
remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such
beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance
I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of
divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright" (p. 136). This moment of
scopophilic fixation, of the gaze erotically medused by its
(painted) object, has a special resonance because we know (as
the Monster does not) that the portrait is of William and
Victor's dead mother. The novel is notable for the absence of
living mothers: Felix and Agatha's mother is dead (and the word
"mother" nowhere figures in the language lesson observed by the
Monster), so is Safie's, Madame Frankenstein dies after
contracting scarlet fever from her adopted daughter, Elizabeth
-- Frankenstein's intended bride -- and the Monster of course
has no mother, only a "father." The portrait of the dead mother
thus represents an essential lack or gap in existence, most
particularly for the Monster, whose primal erotic experience
here is directly Oedipal, but
censored from the outset: the father's interdiction of the
mother as erotic object to the son has never been so radical as
in the case of Frankenstein and his created Monster.8


The Oedipal overtones of the scene become richer and more
complex as we read on. Having taken the portrait, the Monster
enters a barn, where he finds a sleeping woman -- Justine Moritz
-- whom he describes as 'young, not indeed so beautiful as her
whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming
in the loveliness of youth and health' (p. 137). In imitation of Satan
whispering into the ear of the sleeping Eve in Paradise
Lost, the Monster whispers to Justine: "Awake, fairest, thy
{209 lover is near -- he who would give his life but to obtain
one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!" But
this first attempt at seduction on the Monster's part is
self-censoring; when the sleeper stirs, the Monster reflects
that if she awakes, she will denounce him as a murderer. As a
consequence, he decides to pin the murder on her. "Thanks to
the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had
learned how to work mischief." He plants the mother's portrait
in the folds of her dress and flees, with the reflection: "The
crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!" The claim
is curious and excessive, since Justine is in no manner the
"source" of William's murder, which takes place before the
Monster has discovered her sleeping form. In the logic of
desire, if not in syntax, we must find the referent of "her" in
the mother herself. Under the (paternal) interdiction of the
mother, the monsterchild turns to a substitute woman, in a clear
example of what Freud calls an "anaclitic" object choice.9 When it
becomes apparent that this object choice, too, is forbidden,
censored at the root, the erotic drives turn to death drives, to
sadism. The stolen portrait becomes, in the manner of Rousseau's
famous stolen ribbon, a token of the reversibility of drives and
the inversion of love offerings into poisoned gifts.


The story of this double crime terminates the Monster's
narrative. He has now only to sum up the demand to which all his
story has tended: "I am alone and miserable; man will not
associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same
species and have the same defects. This being you must create"
(p. 137). The Monster thus
attempts to state the object of his desire. In constructing his
narrative appeal, he has contextualised desire, made it, or
shown it to be, the very principle of narrative, in its
metonymical forward movement. This movement, in Lacanian terms,
corresponds to the slippage of the inaccessible signified -- the
object of unconscious desire -- under the signifier in the
signifying chain. The movement now, as so often when stories are
told to a narratee, passes on the desire to the interlocutor,
who is charged explicitly with finding the object of desire: of
crossing the 'bar' of repression between signifier and that
other occulted signifier that stands in the place of the
signified of desire, in this instance by the creation of that
which is supposed to signify desire. And yet, the Monster's call
for a female companion, however sincere, may be only in the
realm of conscious desire, may not have access -- as how could
it? -- to what lies under the bar.


If one considers that desire (again in Lacanian terms) is born
in the {210} split between need and demand, where demand is
always in excess of need (for nourishment from the breast,
essentially) and is always an absolute demand for recognition,
and thus desire is essentially unappeasable since it is driven
by infantile scenarios of fulfilment, one wonders whether
Frankenstein's provision of a female companion would really
satisfy the Monster. Love depends on demand -- it is the
creation of speaking beings -- and is in essence the demand to
be heard by the other. What matters is not so much the content
of the demand as the fact that it is unconditional; it expresses
"not the desire of this or that, but desire tout court,"
writes Lacan. What is finally desired by the speaker is "the
desirer in the other," that is, that the speaking subject
himself be "called to as desirable."10 The Monster's unconscious desire
may most of all be for unconditional hearing, recognition, love
from his parent. Its absolute requital could only take the form
of handing over the mother, which in this case is barred not
only by the law of castration but more radically still, since
this mother does not exist and has never existed.


It appears that the Monster's artful activation of the symbolic
order, in his narrative plea, results in a demand to his
listener that, in its consciously stated desire, brings us back
into the order of the imaginary -- to the desire for
phantasmatic satisfactions, impossible to fulfil. How can you
create a mother substitute, or a relationship of the "anaclitic"
type, when there is no mother to substitute for? The radically
absent body of the mother more and more appears to be the
"problem" that cannot be solved in the novel. The female
monster, furthermore, is conceived quite simply as the mirror
image of the Monster, with solely the sexual difference: she has
no other definition than "a female me," which suggests her place
in a primal narcissism which the Monster needs to, and cannot,
go beyond, however 'filthy' his mirror image. This inability to
escape primal narcissism is suggested by other near incestuous
relations in the novel, particularly the marriage of
Frankenstein and Elizabeth.


The female monster will never fully come into being.
Frankenstein tears her nearly completed body to pieces, in
another scopic scene: the Monster is watching at the window of
the laboratory with a "ghastly grin" which turns to a 'howl of
devilish despair and revenge' when his promised body is denied
him (p. 159). It is as if the
Monster's phallic gaze at the female monster's body makes
Frankenstein aware of the bodily potential of a sexual pair of
monsters. Ostensibly Frankenstein abrogates the contract he has
made at the end of the Monster's narrative appeal {211} through
his reflection on the 'Eve problem': that procreation by the
monsters will be simply a "propagated curse," and that the
female monster, as a secondary creation, "might refuse to comply
with a compact made before her creation" (p. 158) -- she might, like Eve,
disobey the paternal injunction, which in this case stipulates
exile from the inhabited parts of the globe. To allow the couple
to create a race of monsters would be to create a new and wholly
uncontrollable signifying chain from their desire, one whose
eventual outcomes "might make the very existence of the species
of man a condition precarious and full of terror." Rather than
accepting a nurturing role toward the Monster, offering him "the
small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow"
(p. 140) -- as he has decided
to do at the close of the Monster's narrative -- Frankenstein
performs the ultimate gesture of castration on the desiring
Monster.


The destruction of the female monster negates any hope that the
Monster might gain access to a "chain of existence and events"
that would offer him relation and the possibility -- even the
phantasmatic possibility -- of satisfaction for his desire. The
godlike science of language has proved deceptive: it has
contextualised desire as lack, as metonymic movement in search
of the meaning of desire, but it has not provided a way to
overcome lack and satisfy desire as, indeed, language never
can. The Monster's error is to believe that signs in artful
rhetorical patterns can produce the desired referent from one's
interlocutor. His definition as monster leads him to an
overvaluation of language, as that which could take him out of
that specular position. Yet he is required, by the logic of
desire, to attempt to make language produce another body, to
return to the imaginary, the specular, and the drama of sexual
difference.


The result is an exacerbated agony of desire between the Monster
and Frankenstein, whereby the Monster strikes at Frankenstein,
not directly, but through elements in Frankenstein's own "chain
of existence and events": after William and Justine Moritz,
Frankenstein's bosom friend Henry Clerval and his bride (and
also adoptive sister) Elizabeth. "I will be with thee on thy
wedding-night," the Monster tells Frankenstein after the
destruction of the female monster (p. 161), a remark that
Frankenstein interprets as a direct menace to his person, thus
repressing what the reader at once grasps: that the threat is to
Elizabeth. On the wedding night he sends Elizabeth to the
nuptial chamber alone, while he prowls about, armed with
pistols, looking to engage in combat with the Monster. "Peace,
peace, my love," he says to Elizabeth; "this night, and all
{212} will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful"
(p. 185). We may read this
dread as related to the quasi-incestuous nature of his union
with Elizabeth. As his father has said, in sounding
Frankenstein's intentions: "You, perhaps, regard her as your
sister, without any wish that she might become your wife" (p. 144). Frankenstein denies
this sentiment, but we cannot help but be struck by the
complication and overlapping of kinship relations in the novel
(as in the family in which Mary Shelley grew up), especially
because they are thrown in high relief by the Monster's own lack
of relation. As the Monster once again watches from the window,
the wedding night ends in a necrophilic embrace, which may be in
the logic of incestuous desire: "I rushed towards her and
embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of
the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to
be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous
mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had
ceased to issue from her lips" (p. 186). The Monster has marked
the body of Frankenstein's bride at the moment when
Frankenstein's desire is on the point of consummation, in
dialectical response to the destruction of his monstrous bride.
The Monster has put his body in the way of Frankenstein's
desire.11


Frankenstein's narrative from this point on tells of the
struggle of his nearly transferential relation with the Monster,
where each represents the lack or gap in the other. "You are my
creator, but I am your master; -- obey!" (p. 160) the Monster has said to
Frankenstein, in a phrase that represents the impossibility of
the situation in which each becomes for the other the "subject
supposed to know" but neither can furnish satisfaction of the
other's lack. Like the Monster, Frankenstein becomes explicitly
Satanic: "like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
chained in an eternal hell" (p.
200). The Monster leads a chase that will take them to the
lifeless polar regions, maintaining the willpower and the
strength of his pursuer by leaving inscribed indications of his
route and caches of food. "Come on, my enemy; we have yet to
wrestle for our lives" (p.
195) reads one inscription, nicely balancing enmity and
affection.


The Monster, Frankenstein states following William's murder, is
"my own vampire, my own spirit set loose from the grave and
forced to destroy all that was dear to me" (p. 74). The statement is as
excessive and curious as it is accurate. It turns the Monster
into a symptom, in Lacan's sense of the term -- that is, a
metaphor, a signifier standing for the indecipherable signifier
of unconscious desire. It may ultimately speak of the sadism
inherent in all intersubjective and especially familial orders
{213} of relation. In particular, it may in this novel suggest
the destructive affect that inhabits the relational order of
language, and particularly narrative language, in the
transferential situation of telling and listening. The Monster's
narrative of unrequited desire and unappeasable lack cannot
produce access to the referent of desire. Instead, it passes on
desire and lack, through the signifying chain of language and
through the interlocutionary relation established in language,
with the result that lack and desire come to inhabit the
listener. As listener or narratee, once you have entered into a
narrative transaction with the Monster, you are yourself tainted
with monsterism: you cannot break out of the relation
established by the pronouns "I" and "thou" once they are seen as
complementary, each elusively representing the answer to the
lack within oneself. The interlocutionary relation, like the
transferential relation in psychoanalysis, could be dissolved
only by the production of that which would answer the Monster's
lack. Because this is impossible, lack is passed on through the
narrative frames -- which is indeed what the framing structure
of the novel is all about.


Frankenstein, once he has become interlocutor to the Monster, is
marked by the taint of monsterism, which he can never appease or
dispel. When in turn, in the next frame (working out from the
inside), Walton becomes Frankenstein's interlocutor, he, too, is
marked by this taint. Walton, we note, is at the outset of the
novel in a position analogous to Frankenstein's when he sets
about his act of creation: he, too, is seeking for Promethean knowledge,
dominion over the unknown, which in his case means exploration
of the unknown polar regions. And like both Frankenstein and the
Monster, he is searching for relation; he complains to his
sister, Margaret Saville, that he has no one "to participate my
joy' or to 'sustain me in dejection" (p. 18). Frankenstein speaks
for both of them when he says: "I agree with you
. . . we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up,
if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves such a friend ought
to be -- do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and
faulty natures" (p. 27).
Friendship, relation, interlocution, suggest an ideal model of
the androgyne, which, as in the Platonic myth, has been split in
half and now desires the missing half. But by the end Walton's
hopes for both Promethean conquest and friendship lie "blasted,"
as his mutinous sailors vote to turn southward and Frankenstein
sinks into death (p. 204).
All that remains to Walton is his epistolary narratee, his
sister; and as he explains to her, being reduced to writing is
no substitute for the living interlocutionary relation: writing
is "a poor medium for the communication of feeling" (p. 18). Moreover, his sister
may never even {214} receive these letters written from beyond
the social world. In any event, for the reader of the novel, Mrs
Saville has no more existence than a postal address, or even a
dead-letter office -- the place where messages end up when they
have nowhere else to go. Her lack of characterised personality
makes her all the more effectively stand for the reader, as the
ultimate receiver of all the nested messages of the novel.


Thus it is that the taint of monsterism, as the product of the
unarrestable metonymic movement of desire through the narrative
signifying chain, may ultimately come to rest with the reader of
the text. Like Frankenstein at the close of the Monster's act of
narration, like Walton at the end of Frankenstein's narrative,
we have a residue of desire and meaning left over, which we must
somehow process. Perhaps it would be most accurate to say that
we are left with a residue of desire for meaning, which we alone
can realise. One could no doubt say something similar about any
narrative text, especially any narrative that dramatises the
fact and the process of its transmission, as "framed tales"
always do. In Frankenstein, the thematisation of the
passing on of unresolved desire for meaning is particularly
evident because the key question, the vital enigma, concerns the
nature of monsterism itself. What is a monster? Reading inward
from the outermost frame, the reader is led to believe that he
or she is making a nearer approach to the solution to this
problem; when the Monster speaks in his own person, assumes the
pronoun "I," we enter the subjectivity of monsterism. But that
solves nothing, and as we read outward from the innermost frame,
we come to realise that we are following the process of the
passing on of this unresolved question, in an unarrestable
metonymy of desire.


In closing his narrative to Walton, Frankenstein warns his
interlocutor against listening to the Monster's voice: "He is
eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over
my heart; but trust him not . . . Hear him not" (pp. 198-99). Yet when the
Monster does finally appear to Walton, saying farewell to
Frankenstein's corpse, Walton bids him stay, and soon his
impulses to destroy the destroyer of his friend are "suspended
by a mixture of curiosity and compassion" (p. 208) -- the very elements
required to seal again the interlocutionary relation, to produce
a new narrative transaction. It is the Monster who unknots this
relation -- and its possible production of a new narrative
frame, a new nested box containing the Monster and Walton --
when he announces that he has resolved to destroy himself. Once
the other of his transferential desire has ceased to be, the
only choice that remains for the Monster is self-immolation. He
announces to Walton: "Neither yours nor all any man's {215}
death is needed to consummate the series of my being and
accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own (p. 210). A moment before, he
has stated that with Frankenstein's death, "the miserable series
of my being is wound to its close" (p. 207). "Series" here is used
in the sense of "sequence" or "order." Conceptually, this phrase
is related to the "chain" which figures the Monster's
understanding of human interrelation, and its counterparts in
language and narration. Failing to enter the "chain of
existence and events," his narrative sequence has wound down to
self-destruction. But the order in which he signifies cannot so
easily be brought to a close, as the passing on of narrative
messages, and narrative desire, may suggest.


In his peroration over Frankenstein's corpse, the Monster also
claims: "Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine" (p. 211). While the
context assigns the cause of this superior agony to the
Monster's remorse, we may want to read it, more absolutely, as a
statement about the fact of being a monster. That is the supreme
agony, which no other problem in desire can efface. The phrase,
like so much else in the novel, returns us to the question, What
is a monster? The novel addresses this question in different
registers. Initially, there is the creation of the Monster,
which is a result of Frankenstein's illicit curiosity. He takes,
in his youth, to reading such alchemical literature as Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus. When his
father censures such work as "trash," he -- like Dora with her
volume of Mantegazza -- seems to be only the more convinced that
they will enable him to "penetrate the secrets of nature" (p. 38-39). He finds that
philosophy has only partially "unveiled the face of Nature." "I
had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to
keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and
rashly and ignorantly I had repined" (p. 39). Frankenstein
recapitulates here the traditional imagery of nature as a woman,
and proposes that truth is a difficult penetration into her
body. As in the case of Dora, epistemophilia finally centres on
the woman's body as the key to forbidden knowledge.


When he reaches the university at Ingolstadt, he falls under the
spell of the chemistry professor Waldman, who tells him that
modern scientists "penetrate into the recesses of nature and
show how she works in her hiding places" (p. 47). This increases his
desire to discover the hidden principle of life itself, to be
able to bestow animation on inanimate matter -- the Promethean
revelation at the centre of the text, which it of course
censors. He then learns how to proceed backward from death to a
new life, using the "loathesome" robbing of graves to create a
new {216} living species. "Life and death," he recalls,
"appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break
through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world" (p. 52). Yet when, after two
years of intense labour, he stands over his created body and
sees "the dull yellow eye of the creature open," his heart is
filled with "disgust" and he flees from his progeny.


Frankenstein's intense curiosity for forbidden knowledge,
coupled with his hysterical reaction to witnessing its
realisation, suggest, as the imagery of unveiling and
penetration already indicated, that his epistemophilia centres
on the arcana of the woman's body, specifically the mother's
body in its reproductive function. The novel, as the
psychoanalyst Marc A. Rubenstein has so well observed, is full
of "primal scene imagery," to the extent that "the spirit of
primal scene observation penetrates into the very structure of
the novel and becomes part of a more deeply hidden search for
the mother."12 The Freudian primal scene is an
intense object of infantile curiosity which, even without actual
observation by the infant, can have the status of a "primal
phantasy." Parental copulation is of course for any individual
the origin of origins, the very "citadel of nature." The novel
suggests a fixation on the primal scene in the conjoined
obsession with origins on the part of both Frankenstein and his
Monster -- who are both deprived of a literal mother on whom to
exercise this curiosity, with the result that they must strive
to create the scene -- and in the intensely visual nature of the
scenes created. Most pertinent here are the scenes of the
Monster's creation (the moment when the Monster opens his eye
produces Frankenstein's hysterical reaction, very much in the
manner of the traumatic dream of Freud's "Wolf Man"); the
aborted creation of the female monster as the Monster watches at
the window; and the wedding night, which recapitulates the
Monster at the window, watching the nuptial bed become a bier.13 Every time
we reach one of the novel's manufactured primal scenes,
something monstrous happens, and the observer is stricken,
punished.14
The very structure of the novel, as Rubenstein argues, suggests
the pervasive effects of primal scene curiosity, a need to
witness the forbidden moment of origin, which produces the
inextinguishable taint of monsterism that gets passed on through
the narrative chain.


It is significant too, that the creation of the Monster from
Frankenstein's studies in physics and chemistry, which are always
on the verge of becoming metaphysics and alchemy, takes place on the
borderline of nature and culture. The Monster is a product of
nature -- his ingredients are 100 percent natural -- yet by the
process and the very fact of his {217} creation, he is
unnatural, the product of philosophical overreaching. Since he
is a unique creation, without precedence or replication, he
lacks cultural as well as natural context. He radicalizes the
situation of Eve, who also
has no "model" -- Adam is
created in God's image, God
is male; thus in whose image is Eve created? -- and is hence a
unique creation, but one that will then be replicated by half
the human race. The Monster is, so to speak, postnatural and
precultural. That a monster can be created within nature may
stand as something of an indictment of nature itself, especially
when one considers the generally ambiguous conceptual position
of nature in the novel. An important thematic focus of this
ambiguity is the figure of Henry Clerval, a being formed "in the
very poetry of nature," Frankenstein tells us (quoting Leigh Hunt), who is described
through the citation of lines from Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey':



         The
sounding cataract

Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,

The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,

Their colours and their forms, were then to him

An appetite; a feeling, and a love,

That had no need of a remoter charm,

By thought supplied, or any interest

Unborrow'd from the eye.



The italicised "him replaces the "me" of the original. The lines
are traditionally taken to represent the speaker's first,
immediate, unreflective relation to nature, now lost to him but
operative still in his sister Dorothy, to whom he can say that
"Nature never did betray / The heart that loved her." Clerval
loves and trusts nature, but he falls victim to the monstrous
creation of his best friend and explicitly pays for
Frankenstein's destruction of the Monster's mate. There is more
to nature than sounding cataracts and sublime mountains: there
is also one's friend's accursed curiosity, creating monsters
demanding sexual satisfaction. It is in the awesome natural sublimity of the Alps, where
Frankenstein has gone to seek consolation, that the Monster
appears to his creator. One senses in Mary Shelley's novel a
profound dissent from some of the more optimistic Romantic views of the moral
principles embodied in nature -- a dissent which recent readings
of Wordsworth and P. B. Shelley find figured
in some of their most problematic moments. {218} Nature in
Frankenstein appears not to be a principle at all: it is
rigorously amoral, it is absence of principle.


What, then, in unprincipled nature, is a monster? A monster is
that outcome or product of curiosity or epistemophilia pushed to
an extreme that results -- as in the story of Oedipus -- in
confusion, blindness, and exile. A monster is that which cannot
be placed in any of the taxonomic schemes devised by the human
mind to understand and to order nature. It exceeds the very
basis of classification, language itself: it is an excess of
signification, a strange byproduct or leftover of the process of
making meaning. It is an imaginary being who comes to life in
language and, once having done so, cannot be eliminated from
language. Even if we want to claim that "monster," like some of
the words used by Felix and Agatha -- "dearest," "unhappy" --
has no referent, it has a signified, a conceptual meaning, a
place in our knowledge of ourselves. The novel insistently
thematizes issues of language and rhetoric because the symbolic
order of language appears to offer the Monster his only escape
from the order of visual, specular, and imaginary relations, in
which he is demonstrably the monster. The symbolic order
compensates for a deficient nature: it promises escape from a
condition of "to-be-looked-at-ness."


That, we may recall, is the term that Laura Mulvey applies to
the "traditional exhibitionist role" given to women in the
cinema.15
When one considers the Monster's creation in the place of the
absent mother, his role and very definition as the insistent
object of visual inspection, with the inevitable hysterical
reaction, and his equally insistent attempt to redefine his
person within the medium of language, especially narrative
language as the vehicle of interpersonal relation, one may ask
if the Monster is not in fact a
woman who is seeking to escape from the feminine condition
into recognition by the fraternity.16 The very peculiarity of a novel
about the monstrous that insistently stages its central issues
in terms of language, rather than in sheerly visual terms --
characteristic, for instance, of Gothic novels -- would thus
become doubly determined: on the thematic level, by the
Monster's attempts to escape the imaginary order; and in the
creative process itself, by Mary Shelley's attempts to escape
the generic and cultural codes that make heroines into objects
to be looked at -- a fate that such heroines as Jane Eyre or
Gwendolen Harleth never entirely escape. If, as Mulvey and other
feminist film theoreticians have argued, the male gaze defines
both the place of the female and the codes for looking at and
defining her -- and also the very genres that stage that looking
-- we may want to understand the {219} persistent countervisual
emphasis of the Monster himself, and the contexts created around
him, as an effort to deconstruct the defining and classifying
power of the gaze, and to assert in its place the potential of
affect created in interlocutory language -- as used, notably, in
the relation of love.


The Monster would thus be a woman, but a woman who would answer
Freud's infamous question "What does a woman want?" with the
ostensible reply: to be a male, with a female to love. In the
failure of that project, the Monster is forced to play the role
of the castrating Medusa woman.17 The novel of course never for a
moment suggests that the Monster is anything but a male, and
both Frankenstein and his creature assume that he is sexually
functional as a male (there would otherwise be no need for
Frankenstein to destroy the female monster). Yet the Monster
never is given the chance to function sexually, and we are never
given a glimpse of those parts of the body that would assure us
that he is male. Of course we aren't: such is not part of the
discourse of the novel (setting aside pornography) at the time.
But this necessary cultural reticence, subjected to our
retrospective critical pressure, may add a further ambiguity to
the problems of definition of monster -- may indeed add another
dimension to that question "What is a monster?" A monster may
also be that which eludes gender definition. In this sense,
Frankenstein would be a more radical version of that
considerable body of Romantic and "Decadent" literature -- such
as Théophile Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin,
Henri de Latouche's Fragoletta, Balzac's
Sarrasine, Rachilde's Monsieur Vénus --
that uses crossdressing and hermaphroditism to create situations
of sexual ambiguity that call into question socially defined
gender roles and transgress the law of castration that defines
sexual difference. The Monster's demand for recognition by his
father could then be read not only as desire for the absent
mother but as a wish to be a sexual object for the father, in
the manner of Freud's Senatspräsident Schreber.18 Because a
monster is that which calls into question all our cultural
codes, including language itself, we can understand the
persistent afterlife of Mary Shelley's creation, which shows us
that, quite literally, once you have created a monster, whatever
the ambiguities of the order of its existence, you can never get
rid of it.


In this context, one might reflect on the moment when
Frankenstein perceives the Monster for the first time following
his flight from the scene of its creation. It comes when
Frankenstein is on his way home after receiving news of
William's murder. It is another of those scenes that bring into
play the sublime power of
nature. A storm breaks out in {220} the Alps, a tempest "so
beautiful yet terrific" (p.
73). "This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I
clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud, 'William, dear angel! This
is thy funeral, this thy dirge!'" No sooner has he uttered these
words than a flash of lightning reveals the presence of the
Monster: natural sublimity once again produces the monstrous.
With this revelation swiftly comes the thought that the Monster
must be William's murderer. "He was the murderer! I
could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an
irresistible proof of the fact" (pp. 73-74). The logic of the
"mere presence of the idea" becoming an "irresistible proof of
the fact" does not stand the test of reason. It is an excessive
conclusion. Yet it is also true. The statement in fact mimes the
process of creation of the Monster, who from a scientific idea
becomes a bodily fact: an idea embodied.


We are always led back, in Frankenstein, to the
peculiarity that this cultural creation, this epistemophilic
product, has become part of nature -- that the idea or concept
of the monster, which at first has no referent in the natural
world, gains one. It gains this referential status as a body. On
a basic level, it is nothing but body: that which exists to be
looked at, pointed to, and nothing more. You can't do anything
with a monster except look at it. Like Virgil's Cyclops, it
blocks out the light, including the light of reason, if reason
be a matter of mental classification and rationalisation. In
this manner, the Monster offers an inversion of the many
scenarios, in Balzac and other novelists, in which the human
body is marked or signed in order to bring it into the field of
signification, so that it can be a narrative signifier. In
Frankenstein, language is marked by the body, by the
process of embodiment. We have not so much a mark on the body as
the mark of the body: the capacity of language to create a body,
one that in turn calls into question the language we use to
classify and control bodies. In the plot of the novel, that body
cannot be touched by any of the human bodies; apparently
indestructible, it can be eliminated only when the Monster
himself chooses to burn himself up. "I shall ascend my funeral
pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing
flames" (p. 211). Note that
his words are in the future tense. The Monster's death never is
recorded within the novel; it never becomes matter for
retrospective narration. We know it is not so easy to get rid of
the monstrous body linguistically created. Mary Shelley's
monster is still out there. It has taken a permanent place in
our imaginary.


Notes


[Peter Brooks' essay uses Lacanian psychoanalysis to examine
relationships between narrative, sexuality and subjectivity,
exploring the way that identity and connections between beings
are constructed in language. The subject is formed by means of a
specular identification with the mirror image of the body: the
imaginary unity of the body that is glimpsed, as other, in the
mirror also provides a sense of psychical integrity. The
assumption of this imaginary unity allows the subject to
position him/herself in relation to the other, the rules and
values of language and culture. Conventionally the body
constitutes a sign of natural origin, but from Lacanian
perspectives it is always inscribed with cultural and symbolic
significance. In Frankenstein, however, the monster has
an artificial body whose development runs counter to
conventionally natural human modes of socialisation: its image
is repulsive and it is only in language that an almost human
identity is attained. The monster thus exceeds and undermines
symbolic categories, showing how notions of nature, culture and
humanity are effects of language and culture. The process of
unnatural embodiment questions the way bodies are created,
classified and controlled, demanding that the relationship
between bodies and representation be seen and thought in
different ways. Fred Botting, p. 103]

1. A diagram of the narrative structure would
look like this: {[( )}}.

2. Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; or, The Modern
Prometheus (New York: NAL/Signet, 1983), pp. 92-93. Subsequent
references are to this edition, which reprints the revised text
of 1831. I have also consulted the helpful critical edition by
James Rieger (Indianapolis and New York; Bobbs-Merrill, 1974),
which prints the original text of 1818 (with the corrections of
1823) and indicates the variants occurring in the revised
edition.

3. For the reader, the contradiction between the
visual and the verbal appears also as a clash of generic
expectations, between the Gothic novel and the
philosophical tale: the Monster's hideous body and the frightful
crimes belong to the Gothic tradition, whereas his
autobiographical narrative and the issues it raises suggest an
eighteenth century philosophical tale.

4. See Roland Barthes, S/Z (Paris:
Editions du Seuil, 1970), pp. 95-96. For some comments on the
model of the "narrative contract," and the need to extend it
toward a more dynamic concept of narrative transaction, see
Peter Brooks, 'Narrative Transaction and Transference', in
Reading for the Plot (1984; rpt. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1992), pp. 216-37.

5. On these questions, see the classic essay by
Emile Benveniste, "De la subjectivité dans le langue," in
Problémes de linguistique générale
(Paris: Gallimard, 1967), pp. 258-66.

6. On the Lacanian terms used here see in
particular Jacques Lacan, "Le stade du miroir" and 'L'instance
de la lettre dans l'inconscient ou la raison depuis Freud," in
Ecrits (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1966), pp. 93-100 and
493-528.

7. See Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Essai sur
l'origine des langues (Paris:Bibliothèque du Graphe,
1973), reprinted from the 1817 edition of Rousseau's works
published by A. Belin. For a thorough and subtle discussion of
Rousseau's presence throughout Frankenstein, see David
Marshall, "Frankenstein, or Rousseau's Monster: Sympathy
and Speculative Eyes," in The Surprising Effects of
Sympathy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988), pp.
178-227. Marshall's comments on the Essai sur l'origine des
langues start from my own evocation of the pertinence of
that text in a very early version of this chapter, "'Godlike
Science/Unhallowed Arts': Language and Monstrosity in
Frankenstein," New Literary History, 9:3 (1978),
reprinted (slightly modified) in
The Endurance of Frankenstein, ed. George Levine and U.
C. Knoepflmacher (Berkeley: University of California Press,
1979) -- but Marshall treats the subject far more fully than I
did.

8. Several
critics have pointed to the importance of the absence of
mothers, and the search for a mother, in Frankenstein:
see in particular Marc A. Rubenstein,
"'My Accursed Origin': The Search for the Mother in
Frankenstein," Studies in Romanticism, 15 (1976),
165-94; Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, "Horror's Twin: Mary
Shelley's Monstrous Eve," in The Madwoman in the Attic
(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), pp. 213-47; Mary Jacobus, "Is There a Woman in This
Text?" in Reading Women: Essays in Feminist Criticism
(New York"Columbia University Press, 1986), esp. p. 101; and
Margaret Homans, "Bearing Demons: Frankenstein's Circumvention
of the Maternal," in Bearing the Word (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1986), pp. 100-19. On the biographical resonances of some of
these issues -- particularly the relation of Mary Shelley to her
mother, Mary
Wollstonecraft, who died shortly after giving birth to her,
and her father, William
Godwin, and her children, especially William -- see, in
addition to the studies just mentioned, Ellen Moers, "Female Gothic," U. C. Knoepflmacher, "Thoughts on the
Aggression of Daughters," and Kate
Ellis, "Monsters in the Garden: Mary Shelley and the
Bourgeois Family," all in The Endurance of Frankenstein.
See also Barbara Johnson, "My
Monster/My Self," in A World of Difference (Baltimore:
Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 144-54. The fullest
and most useful biography of Mary Shelley is Emily W. Sunstein,
Mary Shelley: Romance and Reality (Boston: Little, Brown,
1989).

9. On the "anaclitic" or "attachment type"
(Anlehnungstypus) of object choice, see Freud, "On
Narcissism: An Introduction," Standard Edition, 14:87.
The attachment is that of the sexual instincts to the ego
instincts, with the result of a choice of love objects that
takes the subject back to the mother.

10. 'Qu'est-ce qui est désiré?
C'est le désirant dans l'autre -- ce qui ne peut se faire
qu'à ce que le sujet lui-même soit convoqué
comme désirable. C'est ce qu'il demande dans la demande
d'amour.' Lacan, Le séminaire, vol. 8, Le
transfert (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1991), p. 415.

11. Note in this context the curious scenario
leading to the death of Clerval: Frankenstein rows out to sea in
his skiff and throws the mangled pieces of the female monster
overboard; a storm comes up and blows him off course; he lands
on a strange shore -- it is Ireland -- and is at once arrested
as a murderer, and taken to see the body of his supposed victim,
Clerval. Thus there is a direct exchange between the body of the
female monster and that of Clerval.

12. Rubenstein, "My Accursed Origin," p. 165.

13. In the Wolf Man's dream, 'suddenly the
window opened of its own accord', and the terrified child sees
the wolves sitting in a tree in front of the window, looking at
him attentively. Freud's patient then interprets the window
opening to mean 'My eyes suddenly opened'. See Freud, "From the
History of an Infantile Neurosis," Standard Edition,
17:29-47. On "primal phantasies," see this case history and also
Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis, Standard
Edition, 16:367-71. David Marshall, working from Marc
Rubenstein's suggestions, gives a fine analysis of these scenes,
in The Surprising Effects of Sympathy, pp. 222-6.

14. It is worth mentioning in this context
that during the evenings of reading ghost stories in the Villa Diodati, on the shores
of Lake Geneva, that
brought together the Shelleys with Lord Byron, his personal
physician Dr. Polidori,
and Claire Clairmont
(Byron's mistress and Mary's stepsister) and led to the ghost
story writing 'contest' that produced Frankenstein, P.B. Shelley had a
hallucination: "Byron repeated some verses of Coleridge's Christabel, of the
witch's breast; when silence ensued, and Shelley, suddenly
shrieking and putting his hands to his head, ran out of the room
with a candle. Threw water in his face and after gave him
ether. He was looking at Mrs. Shelley, and suddenly thought of
a woman he had heard of who had eyes instead of nipples, which
taking hold of his mind, horrified him" (The Diary of Dr John
William Polidori, ed. W.M. Rossetti [London: Elkins,
Matthews, 1911], pp. 128-29, quoted by
Rubenstein, p. 184). The woman with eyes in the place of nipples
effectively sexualizes vision, and turns the male's scopic
fixations back on the voyeur, with hallucinatory results.

15. Laura Mulvey, "Visual Pleasure and
Narrative Cinema," in Visual and Other Pleasures
(London: Macmillan, 1989), p. 19.

16. See Gilbert and Gubar, who suggest that the
Monster's "intellectual similarity to his authoress (rather than
his 'author')" indicates that he may be 'a female in disguise'
(The Madwoman in the Attic, p. 237). Mary Jacobus notes
the "bizarre pun' in which Frankenstein describes the Monster as
"a mummy again endued with animation" (Reading Women, p.
101). Margaret Homans, citing
my own argument (in my earlier essay on the novel) about the
Monster's failure to gain his place in the symbolic order,
states: "I would argue that in its materiality and its failure
to acquire an object of desire, the demon enters the symbolic
primarily as the (dreaded) referent, not as signifier. The
negative picture of the demon's materiality is a product of its
female place in the symbolic, and not of any lingering in the
realm of the imaginary (which Brooks, with other readers of
Lacan, views as tragic)" (Bearing the Word, pp. 304-305,
n. 18). I would agree with this to the extent that the
materiality of the Monster continually vitiates his assumed
place -- the place he would assume -- in the symbolic. But
doesn't that status as dreaded referent continually throw him
back into the imaginary?

17. The Monster, we have noted, is often the
observer in the novel, which is the male role. When he is looked
at, however, he takes on aspects of the Medusa, who turns (male)
observers to stone, and who for Freud represents the terror of
the female genitals to the (childish) male observer: see Freud,
"Medusa's Head," Standard Edition, 18:273-74. Note, in
this context, Walton's reaction when he first meets the
Monster: "Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face,
of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes
involuntarily" (p. 207).

18. See Freud, 'Psychoanalytic Notes upon an
Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia
Paranoides)" (1911), Standard Edition, 12:9-82.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREEnigmas Of Identityby Brooks, Peter&quot;We know that it matters crucially to be able to say who we are, why we are here, and where we are going,&quot; Peter Brooks writes inEnigmas of Identity. Many of us are also uncomfortably aware that we cannot provide a convincing account of our identity to others or even ourselves. Despite or because of that failure, we keep searching for identity, making it up, trying to authenticate it, and inventing excuses for our unpersuasive stories about it. This wide-ranging book draws on literature, law, and psychoanalysis to examine important aspects of the emergence of identity as a peculiarly modern preoccupation.In particular, the book addresses the social, legal, and personal anxieties provoked by the rise of individualism and selfhood in modern culture. Paying special attention to Rousseau, Freud, and Proust, Brooks also looks at the intersection of individual life stories with the law, and considers the creation of an introspective project that culminates in psychoanalysis.Elegant and provocative, Enigmas of Identity offers new insights into the questions and clues about who we think we are.General, General, PersonalityCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
