Company Profile
Ascendis Pharma is applying its innovative TransCon technology, which combines the benefits of prodrug and sustained-release technologies, to develop a pipeline of best‐in‐class therapeutics that address significant unmet medical needs. The TransCon technology can be applied to existing drug therapies, including proteins, peptides and small molecules, to create prodrugs that provide for the predictable and sustained release of an unmodified parent drug.
The Ascendis Pharma pipeline includes TransCon Growth Hormone, a program that has completed Phase 2 studies in adults and children with growth hormone deficiency. Ascendis Pharma has initiated the Phase 3 heiGHt Trial for once-weekly TransCon Growth Hormone in pediatric patients. Ascendis Pharma is also developing two additional rare disease product candidates, TransCon PTH and TransCon CNP. In addition to its internal programs, Ascendis Pharma has formed collaborations focused on leading products in large markets that are of strategic importance to its partners. These collaborations are with Sanofi in the field of diabetes and Roche Genentech in the field of ophthalmology.
Ascendis Pharma is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, maintains an office in Palo Alto, California and has research and development facilities in Heidelberg, Germany and Copenhagen, Denmark.




Vision 20/20 Strategic Plan


Ascendis Pharma is working towards a number of long-term strategic goals, outlined in a plan called “Vision 20/20.” This plan reflects our mission to create best-in-class rare disease products that address unmet medical needs by utilizing TransCon technology to improve parent drugs with demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept.

TransCon Technology
Our TransCon technology is designed to solve the fundamental limitations of previous approaches applied to extend duration of a drug’s action in the body, and to enhance the overall benefit of a given therapeutic. TransCon technology combines the benefits of conventional prodrug and sustained release technologies creating a platform technology that is broadly applicable to proteins, peptides and small molecules.
TransCon prodrugs release the unmodified active parent drug at predetermined rates governed by physiological pH and temperature conditions. Consequently, we can design our linkers to release the drug at predictable rates. As the drug is released in its unmodified form, it retains its original mode of action, which we believe may improve the likelihood of clinical development success.

"Our pipeline of three unique, wholly-owned product candidates leverages our TransCon technology platform and product development approach, which may lead to higher success rates than traditional drug development."TransCon Growth Hormone: Phase 3 Program On TrackTransCon Growth Hormone, with convenient weekly dosing, is designed to release unmodified growth hormone that diffuses freely into the body's tissues, maximizing its ability to carry out the systemic effects of endogenous and daily growth hormone.  It is currently in Phase 3 development as a potential therapy for children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).  At ENDO:Two posters described the clinical development program for TransCon Growth Hormone, including results of the pediatric GHD Phase 2 trial, which provided the foundation for the ongoing Phase 3 program.For the first time, Ascendis researchers also presented data regarding the company's proprietary auto-injector device, showing that data collected from >70 patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals found the auto-injector easy-to-use.  With multiple features designed to create a patient-centric experience, the auto-injector will be used in the extension phase of the heiGHt Trial and is planned to be available for launch of TransCon Growth Hormone."There is a significant need for a safe and effective long-acting growth hormone therapy that will help improve compliance in pediatric patients with GHD," said Aristides K. Maniatis, MD, FAAP, pediatric endocrinologist from Rocky Mountain Pediatric Endocrinology and an investigator in the heiGHt Trial.  "The Phase 2 data demonstrated similar efficacy, safety and tolerability of TransCon Growth Hormone compared to daily growth hormone therapy, and I am pleased to be participating in this important Phase 3 study."TransCon Growth Hormone is being evaluated in the Phase 3 heiGHt Trial, which compares its safety, efficacy and tolerability to daily growth hormone therapy.  Ascendis Pharma expects to complete enrollment of the study in the fourth quarter of 2017.TransCon PTH: A True Potential PTH Replacement TherapyTransCon PTH is a sustained-release prodrug of parathyroid hormone [PTH(1-34)] for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, a rare and serious endocrine deficiency disorder that can lead to a variety of neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and other symptoms.  It is designed to maintain a steady PTH level within the physiological range over a 24-hour period, helping to address limitations of available therapies.Two posters at ENDO reviewed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TransCon PTH in animal models:Preclinical data in two separate models demonstrated the infusion-like profile of TransCon PTH following once-daily administration.  Studies in healthy monkeys also showed TransCon PTH increased serum calcium while reducing urinary calcium excretion.  In the late-breaking poster, a study in rats who were PTH-deficient following thyroparathyroidectomy showed TransCon PTH normalized serum calcium and phosphorus. This was compared to a higher daily dose of PTH(1-84), a currently available PTH replacement therapy, which did not. Additionally, the data suggested positive effects on bone turnover at evaluated doses."We are excited about the potential of TransCon PTH, which may more fully control all aspects of hypoparathyroidism and its underlying disease pathophysiology," said David B. Karpf, M.D., Ascendis Pharma's Vice President of Clinical Development and a practicing endocrinologist at Stanford University.  "Clinical trials have demonstrated that an infusion-like profile is superior to once or twice daily injections of PTH(1-34).  TransCon PTH has the potential to become a true PTH replacement therapy as it is designed to maintain physiologic PTH levels around the clock, potentially offering patients a significant treatment advance."Ascendis Pharma plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of TransCon PTH in the third quarter of 2017.TransCon CNP Aims to Improve Efficacy and Safety in a Novel Treatment for AchondroplasiaAscendis scientists presented two posters on TransCon CNP, a sustained-release prodrug of C-Type Natriuretic Peptide, for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism: One presentation summarized the pharmacokinetics and lack of adverse hemodynamic effects of TransCon CNP, allowing for the administration of high doses to facilitate optimal efficacy.A late-breaking poster showed a dose-dependent effect on long bone (tibia) growth in juvenile monkeys with weekly TransCon CNP.  Following two-month data previously presented at the company's recent R&D Update, these results demonstrated growth effects continued through six months.The poster also summarized the effects of TransCon CNP in a mouse model of achondroplasia, including bone growth and the potential to ameliorate some of the more disabling achondroplasia traits, including stenosis of the foramen magnum."The encouraging TransCon CNP preclinical data support the hypothesis that a CNP analogue can be an effective treatment for achondroplasia without dose-limiting hypotension," said Kennett Sprogøe, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Product Innovation at Ascendis Pharma.  "Patients with achondroplasia have no approved drug therapies, and we are pleased to advance a novel product candidate in this area of significant unmet medical need."Ascendis Pharma plans to submit an investigational new drug application or equivalent for TransCon CNP in the fourth quarter of 2017.All eight poster presentations from ENDO 2017 are available on the Publications page in the Pipeline section of the company's website at www.ascendispharma.com.Read MoreAbout Ascendis Pharma A/SAscendis Pharma is applying the TransCon technology platform to build a leading rare disease commercial company.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.

Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
