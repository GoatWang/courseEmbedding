Last Night on Late NightTim Allen says to be 'real careful' talking about Trump: 'This is like '30s Germany'
The comedian recalled his visit to Trump’s inauguration

Nick Romano•@NickARomanoPosted on March 17, 2017 at 9:46am EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 




Tim Allen told Jimmy Kimmel Thursday that he likes to skirt “both sides” of politics as a comedian, but he compared discussions of Donald Trump to Germany in the 1930s.
“You’ve gotta be real careful around here,” he said on Jimmy Kimmel Live. “You get beat up if don’t believe what everybody believes.” Allen jokingly added, “This is like ’30s Germany. I don’t know what happened. If you’re not part of the group, ‘you know what we believe is right,’ I go, ‘Well, I might have a problem with that.'”
Allen had experienced a bit of backlash over his previous comments about Trump. “What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn’t like Trump because he was a bully,” he told Megyn Kelly on Fox News. “But if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied for doing that. And it gets a little bit hypocritical to me.”
Allen continued his conversation with Kimmel by recalling his experience at Trump’s inauguration, which many celebrities did not attend and more still protested at the Women’s Marches around the globe.

“This government does stuff big,” he said. “I’ve never been to anything like that. Just so many people, and when they show up, you know, the ex-president gets in a helicopter and there’s jets and marines taking him this way and there’s parades, but it looks like a Cadillac parade, everything was just rows of Cadillacs. My kids were going, ‘Is this the parade?’ It’s like black Cadillac after black Cadillac and then a tractor.”
Watch Allen in the clip above.
