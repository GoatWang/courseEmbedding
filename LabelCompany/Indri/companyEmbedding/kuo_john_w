Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Anika Therapeutics Appoints Industry-Recognized R&D Executive John W. Sheets, Jr., Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer | Business Wire
























































Anika Therapeutics Appoints Industry-Recognized R&D Executive John W. 
      Sheets, Jr., Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer




Anika Also Announces Resignation of COO Frank Luppino






October 02, 2013 03:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anika 
      Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANIK), a leader in products for tissue 
      protection, healing and repair, based on hyaluronic 
      acid (“HA”) technology, today announced it has appointed John W. 
      Sheets, Jr., Ph.D. as its new Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Sheets joins 
      Anika from Boston Scientific, where he was Senior Vice President, 
      Corporate Research. At Boston Scientific, he was responsible for 
      revitalizing product development by establishing new global processes, 
      creating worldwide technology strategies, and establishing new product 
      sourcing and development networks with a focus on emerging markets.
    


      Dr. Sheets replaces Jing-wen Kuo, Ph.D. who is leaving to pursue other 
      opportunities at the end of October. In addition to driving Anika’s 
      research and development efforts, Dr. Sheets is leading the company’s 
      regulatory, clinical affairs and engineering functions. These previously 
      were overseen by COO Frank Luppino, who is leaving Anika at the end of 
      October to pursue other interests. Mr. Luppino’s remaining 
      responsibilities are being smoothly transitioned to existing senior 
      executives, with operations management reporting directly at the CEO 
      level.
    

      “John’s appointment as Chief Scientific Officer to oversee our 
      technology and pipeline development provides us with significantly 
      stronger leadership in those critical areas,” said Charles H. Sherwood, 
      Ph.D., Anika’s President and CEO. “His R&D expertise, multi-national 
      partnership experience, and business acumen will be valuable assets as 
      we advance Anika’s strategic initiatives and prepare the company for the 
      next level of growth. As we welcome John, we also would like to thank 
      Frank and Jing-wen for their many contributions to Anika’s past success.”
    

      Prior to his work at Boston Scientific, Dr. Sheets was Corporate Vice 
      President of R&D and Chief Technology Officer for Bausch and Lomb. He 
      also served as President of Hoya Surgical Optics and worked for Ethicon 
      (Johnson & Johnson), Alcon Laboratories and Iolab Corporation (Johnson & 
      Johnson) in California. Dr. Sheets holds a B.S., a M.S., and a Ph.D. in 
      Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Florida, 
      Gainesville.

The statements made in this press release which are not statements of 
      historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements 
      include, but are not limited to, those relating to the appointment of 
      John Sheets, Jr., Ph.D. as Anika’s Chief Scientific Officer; the 
      departure of Jing-wen Kuo, Ph.D. as the company’s Chief Scientific 
      Officer; the departure of Frank Luppino as the company’s Chief Operating 
      Officer; the nature and successful transition of Mr. Luppino’s 
      responsibilities to existing senior executives; and the impact of 
      management changes on its development initiatives and preparation of the 
      company for the next level of growth. The company's actual 
      results could differ materially from any anticipated future results, 
      performance or achievements described in the forward-looking statements 
      as a result of a number of factors including (i) the company's ability 
      to successfully commence and/or complete clinical trials of its products 
      on a timely basis or at all, obtain pre-clinical or clinical data to 
      support a pre-market approval application or 510(k) application, or 
      timely file and receive FDA or other regulatory approvals or clearances 
      of its products, or that such approvals will not be obtained in a timely 
      manner or without the need for additional clinical trials, other testing 
      or regulatory submissions, as applicable; (ii) the company's research 
      and product development efforts and their relative success, including 
      whether the company has any meaningful sales of any new products 
      resulting from such efforts; (iii) the cost effectiveness and efficiency 
      of the company’s clinical studies, manufacturing operations and 
      production planning; (iv) the strength of the economies in which the 
      company operates or will be operating, as well as the political 
      stability of any of those geographic areas; (v) future determinations by 
      the company to allocate resources to products and in directions not 
      presently contemplated; (vi) the company’s ability to launch Monovisc in 
      the U.S., if at all; (vii) the company’s ability to provide an adequate 
      and timely supply of its ophthalmic, Orthovisc and other products to its 
      customers; (viii) the company’s ability to successfully manage and 
      turnaround Anika S.r.l.’s business; and (ix) the company’s ability to 
      achieve its stated growth targets. Certain other factors that 
      might cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those 
      in the forward-looking statements include those set forth under the 
      headings "Business," "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and 
      Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the 
      company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
      2012, as well as those described in the company's other press releases 
      and SEC filings.
