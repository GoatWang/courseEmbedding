Douglas E Blom's Experience
Title: Director of International Subsidiary Operations
               Company: Bucyrus International , Inc.
Job Details
               Bucyrus International, Inc. is a world leader in the design and manufacture of high productivity mining equipment for the surface and underground mining industries. Bucyrusâ€™ surface mining equipment is used for mining coal, copper, iron ore, oil sands and other minerals. Bucyrusâ€™ underground mining equipment is used primarily for mining coal and also used in mining minerals such as Potash and Trona. In addition to machine manufacturing, Bucyrus manufactures high quality OE parts and provides world-class support services for their machines.
Title: 
               Company: P&H Mining Equipment Inc
Job Details
               P&H Mining Equipment is committed to an incident-free culture. Our commitment to environmental, health and safety (EHS) is paramount. We believe that EHS is a key indicator of organizational excellence and sustainability of our business and that production, quality and EHS are among the most important goals in manufacturing. A strong EHS culture results in increased productivity, quality of equipment and services, significant employee morale and, ultimately, greater revenues. We drive our EHS culture through strong leadership and the involvement of all our employees to ensure we will not compromise our EHS values. We are proud of our clean manufacturing facilities and our recycling initiatives and we consistently seek means to reduce waste streams and meet or exceed regulatory environmental compliance. We strive to maximize productivity without compromising on employee safety. The implementation of a comprehensive safety and health program is an important tool for creating both a safe and profitable workplace. The benefits of maintaining a safe work environment are many, but first and foremost, safety is about protecting our workers. The practice of safety also brings financial benefits. A safe work environment impacts a company's bottom line, both directly and indirectly. Costs associated with incidents, including lost costs, workers' compensation claims, insurance costs and legal fees are minimized in a safe work environment. So are the indirect costs that follow incidents. Further, a safe work environment boosts employee morale, which, in turn, increases productivity, efficiency and profit margins. There are fewer staff absences, less staff turnover and an improved quality of work. Bottom line - if a company does safety effectively, it will result in fewer schedule interruptions and minimize costs. We are committed to providing safe work areas, machinery and equipment; to providing information, instruction, training and supervision; and to providing personal protective equipment. We are committed to creating an injury-free workplace for employees, suppliers, contractors, partners and visitors alike.
