Paine Webber's President, 54, Quits, Talking of a New Career


By PETER TRUELL


Published: April 29, 1995









                    Paul B. Guenther resigned yesterday as president of the Paine Webber Group to pursue another career, and he said he would spend more time working with charitable and nonprofit organizations.        

                    In an interview, Mr. Guenther, who will remain as a consultant to Paine Webber for three years, said he had always wanted to make such a move, and felt that with the completion of Paine Webber's $1.96 billion purchase of Kidder, Peabody, now was a good time.        

                    "I feel the timing is right for me to make a major career change and pursue something entirely different," said Mr. Guenther, who will turn 55 next week, adding that his family was elated at his decision.        

                    Mr. Guenther has worked at Paine Webber for the last 29 years, has been on its board since 1986, and was named head of its brokerage subsidiary in 1988.        

                    With $4.3 billion in capital, Paine Webber is one of the largest brokerage firms in the country with 16,330 employees and 333 offices. It increased its capital-markets and wholesale businesses with the December 1994 acquisition of Kidder from the General Electric Company.        

                    Discussing what career he might pursue next, Mr. Guenther said, "I'll see what's available."        

                    He indicated a strong interest in charitable and nonprofit work, mentioning his current positions as a member of the board of overseers of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business and his vice chairmanship of Fordham University's board of trustees.        

                    Paine Webber's chairman and chief executive, Donald B. Marron, 60, said of the resignation: "I'm sad. He's done a lot for the firm."        

                    Mr. Marron added that Paine Webber had no immediate plans to fill Mr. Guenther's position. The post had been vacant before his appointment, Mr. Marron said, adding that Paine Webber's top management had been substantially strengthened by the addition of senior Kidder executives like Mark B. Sutton, the director of its private-client group; Michael D. Madden, now vice chairman of Paine Webber Inc., and Steven P. Baum, co-director of the firm's fixed-income division.        

                    Mr. Guenther denied that he was resigning because he might not get the chance to succeed Mr. Marron.        

                    "I never aspired to be chief executive," he said, restating a desire to find new challenges for his remaining working years.
