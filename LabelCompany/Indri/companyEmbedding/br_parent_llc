Beware of the Parent LLC that Owns a Subsidiary LLC








Beware of the Parent LLC that Owns a Subsidiary LLC

Question:  My accountant says that I should form a parent LLC that will own subsidiary LLCs to reduce the administration headaches and expenses.  Should I have a parent LLC own three other LLCs that each own a rental property?
Answer:  It depends on your risk tolerance.
A lot of people ask me what I think about the parent – subsidiary entity structure. This structure exists when one LLC (the parent LLC) owns one or more other LLCs (subsidiary LLCs).
Most people understand that maximum asset protection requires that you put one real estate property or one business in an LLC that owns no other property or operates no other businesses. We all know what happens if you put all your eggs in one basket and drop the basket – you lose all your eggs. The primary reason to put real estate properties and businesses in separate limited liability companies is so that a financial problem with one does not affect the value of any other properties or business.
There are several disadvantages with owning multiple entities. They are more expensive to create and operate. The administrative burdens such as bookkeeping and tax returns are multiplied. You need a separate bank account for each entity. Multiple entities are more work and cost more than a single entity.
Some people create a parent – subsidiary entity structure to reduce the burdens of owning and operating multiple limited liability companies. The parent – subsidiary structure exists when multiple entities (the “subsidiaries”) are owned by a single entity (the “parent”). Many accountants recommend the parent – subsidiary structure to reduce administrative burdens and costs. Some people create this structure when they own a lot of LLCs that have rental real estate properties and want to have a parent LLC that is a property management company.
The problem with the parent – subsidiary structure is that you are taking your carefully and expensively created separate entities that you formed to maximize asset protection and putting them all in one basket. If a creditor sues the parent and gets a judgment against the parent, the creditor can reach all of the parent’s non-LLC assets, but if the subsidiary LLCs are Arizona LLCs the creditor can only serve a charging order on every subsidiary entity.  The charging order would require the subsidiary LLCs to make all future distributions of money or property to the creditor instead of to the parent LLC.
You may think the risk of having a claim brought against the parent is low, but it may not be. For example, if you are driving to meet a prospective tenant who wants to rent a home owned by LLC #1 and you run a red light and kill or injure somebody, you and the parent and LLC #1 will be sued and you and the two LLCs will be liable. If the judgment exceeds the parent’s insurance coverage, the creditor will take everything the parent owns until the judgment is satisfied.
If you are contemplating the parent – subsidiary entity structure, you will have to decide, which is more important: (i) maximizing asset protection, or (ii) minimizing administrative burdens or expenses.
P.S. If you do have a parent – subsidiary structure, make sure that your insurance coverage is adequate.

Hello and thank you for posting a most informative article.  As a follow-up question, I was wondering if there is any advantage to forming a parent-subsidiary structure when one only owns one LLC? For example, would there be any legal advantages to forming a general umbrella LLC as a parent, to put a current LLC under and any future LLCs that may be created?
Thank you again!

There are times when a parent subsidiary LLC structure is appropriate.  Call me to discuss this issue in more depth.

 How to Set Up an LLC With Subsidiary Companies | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  How to Set Up an LLC With Subsidiary Companies  by Kevin Johnston        Place subsidiaries under a parent LLC so you don't gamble your assets. Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Subsidiary] | How to Create a Subsidiary Under an LLC 2 [LLC Parent Company] | How to Organize an LLC Parent Company With Other Trade Names 3 [Company] | How to Set Up a Subsidiary Company 4 [Company] | What Documents Do I Need to Set Up a Subsidiary Company?    A limited liability company (LLC) protects your personal assets from business liabilities. If someone sues your company or claims the company owes money, your personal assets are protected. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service does not tax an LLC. If you have subsidiaries, you can protect them with your LLC as the parent company. All of the profits will pass through to you, and none of your subsidiaries will owe taxes or expose your personal assets to lawsuits or seizure.        Form the Parent LLC 1. Select a name that contains "LLC." Part of the legal requirement for holding an LLC is that you make it clear how it is organized. By placing "LLC" at the end of your company name, you let everybody know what type of entity they are dealing with. Example: Widget Makers, LLC.  2. Complete the organization papers. These are available through offices that handle the formation of new businesses. If you prefer, you can pay for them online with companies such as LegalZoom. The papers ask for names and addresses of LLC owners and the nature of the business that you plan to form.  3. File your LLC papers with your state department that handles the registration of new businesses. You may have to pay a fee ranging up to $1,000, depending on your particular state's fee structure.  4. Publish a notice in local papers indicating you have formed an LLC. Your state may designate specific newspapers for these notices. You have to pay to publish the notice, and in some localities this can cost more than the filing fee. Form Subsidiaries 1. Form each of your subsidiaries by filing LLC organization papers that list your parent LLC as the owner of the subsidiary. This will allow all profits from the subsidiaries to pass through to the parent LLC and then to you, without being taxed until you pay your personal income tax.  2. Examine the protections you have. If one of the subsidiaries has a claim or judgment against it, the parent LLC's assets will not be in jeopardy. The owner of an LLC enjoys protected assets, and in this case the owner is itself an LLC.  3. Examine your liabilities. If the parent LLC has a claim or judgment against it, the assets of the subsidiaries could be in jeopardy. Any action against the parent can legally go after the parent company's assets, which in this case are LLCs themselves.            Tip  Instead of forming subsidiaries, you can form separate LLCs for each of your business interests. They will stand alone and not have interrelated liabilities.

      Various Business Units under a Single Brand




Parent Company Behind P90X® and Other Leading Fitness Products 
      Continues Ongoing Mission to Enhance Lives with Promise of 
      Self-Improvement






December 08, 2010 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Product Partners, LLC, the parent company behind Beachbody® – the heath 
      and fitness innovators responsible for P90X® and a variety of other 
      leading fitness products – announced today that it has changed its name 
      to Beachbody, LLC. The move is designed to bring the organization’s 
      various business units in health and fitness, nutrition and skin care 
      under a single brand name, more reflective of the company’s corporate 
      mission and culture.
    


      “The success of products such as P90X®, Hip Hop Abs® and TurboJam® has 
      created substantial brand awareness for the umbrella brand, Beachbody,” 
      said Carl Daikeler, Chief Executive Officer, Beachbody, LLC. “As we 
      continue to expand with new innovative products in various categories – 
      all which are geared to help people lead a healthy fulfilling life – it 
      made sense to unify everything under the name that has come to symbolize 
      a healthy lifestyle. We believe ‘Beachbody’ represents more than simply 
      a name; it captures our corporate promise and mission of improving 
      quality of life.”
    

      Having the company’s various products unified under the Beachbody name 
      will allow it to benefit from the shared brand equity. Beachbody’s 
      product portfolio features the industry’s leading video-exercise 
      programs, including P90X®, Insanity®, Hip-Hop Abs®, Slim in 6® and 
      TurboFire® among others, the Shakeology® line of nutritional drinks and 
      dietary supplements, and the Timeless Secret® and Derm Exclusive® beauty 
      brands.
    

      Founders Daikeler, and Jon Congdon, President, Beachbody, LLC, will 
      continue to serve in their respective roles, along with the entire 
      management team.
    

      “We have wrestled with the notion of this name change for a while now,” 
      said Congdon. “Product Partners just didn’t capture the spirit of our 
      business mission, our corporate culture or the Team Beachbody sales 
      network. With Beachbody, LLC, we are now under a name that represents 
      our products and the mantra from which our entire company is motivated: 
      to feel good about yourself, inside and out.”
    

      Beachbody has grown into a fitness industry leader with over $400 
      million in annual sales. The success of its fitness products motivated 
      company founders to explore other physical qualities that directly 
      affect a person’s sense of mental vitality and overall quality of life. 
      This exploration has led to the introduction of innovative nutritional, 
      health and beauty products. Beachbody’s expertise in selling through 
      infomercials and multi-level marketing has catapulted it to the top of 
      the fitness industry, while providing a life-changing business 
      opportunity for over 40,000 independent distributor “coaches” nationwide.

Unauthorized access. How to Create a Subsidiary Under an LLC | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  How to Create a Subsidiary Under an LLC  by Owen E. Richason IV        Multiple ownership of a new corporation is established at the initial organizational meeting. Digital Vision./Digital Vision/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Subsidiary Companies] | How to Set Up an LLC With Subsidiary Companies 2 [Company] | What Documents Do I Need to Set Up a Subsidiary Company? 3 [Business] | How to Create a Subsidiary Business 4 [Creating Subsidiary] | The Advantages & Disadvantages of Creating Subsidiary & Operating Companies    An LLC, or limited liability company, is a hybrid of a corporation and a partnership. It provides personal asset protection like a corporation and is considered a "disregarded entity" by the IRS, allowing the company to "pass through" earnings straight to its members, or owners. A subsidiary is a firm controlled by another firm (also referred to as the parent) through the ownership of more than 50 percent of its voting stock. LLCs usually form subsidiaries to act as an extension of the parent company to venture into new markets.         1. Choose a name for the LLC subsidiary. Visit the secretary of state's website and perform a name search using your LLC's subsidiary name to determine if it is available to register for use. Some states require "LLC" to be part of the business's name, while others only require the term "limited" to appear in the company name. Generally, a subsidiary cannot have the same name as its parent company, but may be similar. For instance, if the parent company's name is More, Wade and Bode, LLC, the subsidiary could be named MWB, LLC, or MW&amp;B, LLC.  2. Create the subsidiary's Articles of Organization. Hire an attorney or use an online legal document creation service. The Articles of Organization list the name of the company, its members, its address, the type of business and names a registered agent--the person responsible for receiving any legal documents. These documents should be modeled from the parent company's documents.  3. Write a subsidiary Operating Agreement. An Operating Agreement is a document that includes the type of business formation, such as an LLC or LLP, the names of members and the percentage of the company they own, the managerial structure, the responsibilities of each member and how to add or remove members or dissolve the company. The subsidiary agreement should conform to the parent firm's operating agreement.  4. Register the subsidiary with the appropriate government agency. File the Articles of Organization with the controlling state agency--this is usually the secretary of states or division of corporations. If you use an online legal documentation service, it will file these articles electronically on behalf of your company. As an alternative, contact the secretary of state's or division of corporation's office and inquire how to file the articles.  5. Acquire any mandatory licenses and/or permits. Contact local county and city government licensing offices to determine if the subsidiary needs any licenses or permits to legally operate. Additionally, inquire if the subsidiary can operate under the parent company's licenses and permits.
