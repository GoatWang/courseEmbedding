Accel Inc. > Who We Are > Company Profile  









Why Does Accel Exist:
The company was founded in 1995 to fulfill a need for a contract hand assembly manufacturer to be committed to superior quality, to react to speed to market, to engineer lines for cost savings, and to sustain a world-class inventory tracking system. Accel Inc. exists to get the customer what they want, when they want it. Accel responds to retail client's "pull" demands for product by creating an environment of flexibility. Accel's support of the client's "pull" demands results in decreased markdowns leading to higher profitability for the client and enhanced satisfaction of the client's customers.
Accel's Principals, Tara and David Abraham, were able to successfully launch, grow, and sustain it due to the combination of Tara's merchandising knowledge, David's operational expertise and their joint ability to recruit and retain outstanding management and production teams. The Company has seen exceptional growth since the first day it opened its doors by thriving off the solid partnerships they have built with its clients.
Mission:
To provide hand assembly manufacturing solutions to the nation's leading corporations. To be an essential partner in our clients’ success by assembling products flawlessly, profitably and to maximum consumer satisfaction.
Vision:
To reinvent the way that American companies prepare and deliver goods to market, drastically improve domestic competitiveness with foreign suppliers, thereby revitalizing the jobs market for our American workforce. Our trademark blend of design, innovative hand assembly, state of art technology and artistic vision enables our clients to deliver products that are customer responsive, environmentally responsible and cost-efficient at every step of the assembly process from intake to consumers’ hands.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORERebel Genius: Warren S. Mcculloch's Transdisciplinary Life In Scienceby Abraham, Tara H.Warren S. McCulloch (1898--1969) adopted many identities in his scientific life -- among them philosopher, poet, neurologist, neurophysiologist, neuropsychiatrist, collaborator, theorist, cybernetician, mentor, engineer. He was, writes Tara Abraham in this account of McCulloch's life and work, "an intellectual showman," and performed this part throughout his career. While McCulloch claimed a common thread in his work was the problem of mind and its relationship to the brain, there was much more to him than that. In  Rebel Genius, Abraham uses McCulloch's life as a window on a past scientific age, showing the complex transformations that took place in American brain and mind science in the twentieth century -- particularly those surrounding the cybernetics movement.Abraham describes McCulloch's early work in neuropsychiatry, and his emerging identity as a neurophysiologist. She explores his transformative years at the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute and his work with Walter Pitts -- often seen as the first iteration of "artificial intelligence" but here described as stemming from the new tradition of mathematical treatments of biological problems. Abraham argues that McCulloch's dual identities as neuropsychiatrist and cybernetician are inseparable. He used the authority he gained in traditional disciplinary roles as a basis for posing big questions about the brain and mind as a cybernetician. When McCulloch moved to the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT, new practices for studying the brain, grounded in mathematics, philosophy, and theoretical modeling, expanded the relevance and ramifications of his work. McCulloch's transdisciplinary legacies anticipated today's multidisciplinary field of cognitive science.Science & Technology, CyberneticsCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
