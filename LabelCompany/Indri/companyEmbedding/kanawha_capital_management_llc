Goal Models
It’s important for our clients to gauge the likelihood of achieving their planning objectives.  As such, the focus of our analysis is on assessing a client’s ability to meet their goals.  Our financial goal models are designed to clearly define a client’s spending objectives and then analyze the impact of these future cash outflows on their investment assets.  We incorporate a goals-based planning framework which utilizes probability analysis, what-if scenarios, and stress testing.
A probabilistic approach is used to evaluate the odds of success of a client meeting their spending objectives.  Multiple scenarios can be incorporated to analyze the impact that different variables may have on the plan.  Stress testing is also applied to give the client a sense of how their plan might hold up under adverse circumstances.

Individual Clients
Consider us a road map for your journey in achieving your financial goals.
Look closely and you will see that the world is a maze of financial options. However, when you step back, you realize that off-the-shelf financial advice often does not mirror your particular needs. This is exactly where Kanawha comes in.
If you have investment needs that require personal attention and flexibility to work with your existing portfolio, we may be just the manager you have been looking for.
Most of our taxable portfolios have two common goals: long-term growth of capital without taking on undue risk and tax efficiency. Kanawha’s equity approach of blending characteristics of both growth and value styles is designed to produce competitive returns. Our adherence to both valuation and diversification criteria seeks to minimize downside risk within the portfolio, thereby limiting potential loss during periods of market turbulence.
We recognize that each client has unique personal goals and tolerance for risk. We take these issues into account in constructing a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and bonds for each client. Your mix of securities will be determined by your long-term goals, market conditions, and our shared desire to avoid excessive short-term risk.

Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (9.75% upside)

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
