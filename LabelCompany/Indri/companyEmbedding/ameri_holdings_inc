Experienced management team and highly-accomplished Board 
2015 pro forma guidance: at least $20 million of revenues and 15% adjusted EBITDA margins(1) 
Pro forma capitalization structure: 12.5 million basic shares outstanding, $5.7 million in cash(2), $5.0 million in convertible debt with a conversion price of $1.80 per share with no other debt outstanding, and $5.0 million of warrants with an exercise price of $1.80 per share 
AMERI Holdings, Inc. will analyze acquisition targets of both public and private technology services companies and has a long-term business plan to reach $100 million in annual revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions 
Peer companies include Cartesian Inc., Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., IGATE Corporation, Mindtree Ltd., RCM Technologies Inc., and Syntel Inc.
AMERI Holdings, Inc. ("Ameri100" or the "Company"), formerly Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: SPZRD), announced today that it completed a reverse merger in which Ameri and Partners Inc. ("Ameri and Partners") became a wholly owned subsidiary of AMERI Holdings, Inc.  The Company will be conducting business under the brand name "Ameri100."  The Company has received a temporary ticker symbol of "SPZRD", which will be replaced by OTC in 20 business days with a new symbol reflecting the new name of the Company.
Ameri100 is a technology-management solutions company that enables its customers to implement IT solutions to optimize their systems and operations.  Ameri100 architects and delivers efficient technology solutions to Global 2000 companies, some of the world's largest public companies, in addition to middle market companies. Ameri100 has also developed products and apps that assess IT readiness and assist clients in their business transformation processes and ongoing support needs.  The Company has developed a global ecosystem of specific product experts who partner with Ameri100 on a project-by-project basis to help solve critical technology challenges for clients.
The Company's new management team includes experienced executives with extensive backgrounds at large technology companies such as Infosys, Accenture, SAP, Intelligroup, and Thomson Reuters. Ameri100's management team includes: Giri Devanur (President and CEO), Srinidhi "Dev" Devanur (Executive Vice Chairman), Srirangan "Ringo" Rajagopal (EVP - Client Relations), Brunda Jagannath (VP - Finance), Anand Sundar (EVP - Enterprise Systems), Carlos Fernandez (EVP - Strategic Initiatives), Rajesh Sundar (EVP - Products), and Manjunath Dattatreya (EVP - Human Capital).  
The Company's Board of Directors will consist of seven members: Jeffrey E. Eberwein (Chairman), Srinidhi Devanur (Executive Vice Chairman), Giri Devanur (CEO), Dimitrios J. Angelis,  Dr. Arthur M. Langer, Robert G. Pearse, and Robert Rosenberg.
In conjunction with becoming a public company, Ameri100 completed a private placement, issuing a $5 million convertible note and $5 million in warrants to Lone Star Value Investors, LP.  Upon conversion of the warrant for cash, the total gross amount raised by Ameri100 in this offering would be $10 million.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering principally for market expansion and strategic acquisitions.  Further, the Board adopted, and the Company's shareholders approved, a 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan for executive officers, key employees, and directors.
President and Chief Executive Officer Giri Devanur said, "The technology services industry is going through a fundamental shift.  We are pioneering the outsourcing 3.0 era via our global partner ecosystem and bringing our Global 2000 customers a highly specialized offering with extreme agility.  We have developed innovative new products such as the Langer Index in conjunction with Dr. Langer of the Center for Technology Management at Columbia University.  We will soon be launching a SAP HANA version of the Langer Index.  In addition, we recently acquired Linear Logics, a Pennsylvania-based supply chain specialist company with an award winning SAP mobility product."
In accordance with "reverse merger" accounting treatment, the Company's historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Ameri and Partners prior to the merger in all future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Panamax Capital, LLC was the exclusive financial advisor and Warshaw Burstein, LLP was the legal advisor to Ameri and Partners in connection with the merger.  Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP represented AMERI Holdings, Inc. and Lone Star Value.
The securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be resold absent registration under, or exemption from registration under, such Act.

AMERI Holdings, Inc. Becomes a Public Company

Completes Private Placement of up to $10 Million with Lone Star Value EDISON, N.J., May 26, 2015
Transaction Highlights:
Going public transaction completed with strategic investor, Lone Star Value Investors, LP
Experienced management team and highly-accomplished Board
2015 pro forma guidance: at least $20 million of revenues and 15% adjusted EBITDA margins(1)
Pro forma capitalization structure: 12.5 million basic shares outstanding, $5.7 million in cash(2), $5.0 million in convertible debt with a conversion price of $1.80 per share with no other debt outstanding, and $5.0 million of warrants with an exercise price of $1.80 per share
AMERI Holdings, Inc. will analyze acquisition targets of both public and private technology services companies and has a long-term business plan to reach $100 million in annual revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions
Peer companies include Cartesian Inc., Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., IGATE Corporation, Mindtree Ltd., RCM Technologies Inc., and Syntel Inc. AMERI Holdings, Inc. (“Ameri100″ or the “Company”), formerly Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: SPZRD), announced today that it completed a reverse merger in which Ameri and Partners Inc. (“Ameri and Partners”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of AMERI Holdings, Inc.  The Company will be conducting business under the brand name “Ameri100.”  The Company has received a temporary ticker symbol of “SPZRD”, which will be replaced by OTC in 20 business days with a new symbol reflecting the new name of the Company.
Ameri100 is a technology-management solutions company that enables its customers to implement IT solutions to optimize their systems and operations.  Ameri100 architects and delivers efficient technology solutions to Global 2000 companies, some of the world’s largest public companies, in addition to middle market companies. Ameri100 has also developed products and apps that assess IT readiness and assist clients in their business transformation processes and ongoing support needs.  The Company has developed a global ecosystem of specific product experts who partner with Ameri100 on a project-by-project basis to help solve critical technology challenges for clients.
The Company’s new management team includes experienced executives with extensive backgrounds at large technology companies such as Infosys, Accenture, SAP, Intelligroup, and Thomson Reuters. Ameri100’s management team includes: Giri Devanur (President and CEO), Srinidhi “Dev” Devanur (Executive Vice Chairman), Srirangan “Ringo” Rajagopal (EVP – Client Relations), Brunda Jagannath (VP – Finance), Anand Sundar (EVP – Enterprise Systems), Carlos Fernandez (EVP – Strategic Initiatives), Rajesh Sundar (EVP – Products), and Manjunath Dattatreya (EVP – Human Capital).
The Company’s Board of Directors will consist of seven members: Jeffrey E. Eberwein (Chairman), Srinidhi Devanur (Executive Vice Chairman), Giri Devanur (CEO), Dimitrios J. Angelis,  Dr. Arthur M. Langer, Robert G. Pearse, and Robert Rosenberg.
In conjunction with becoming a public company, Ameri100 completed a private placement, issuing a $5 million convertible note and $5 million in warrants to Lone Star Value Investors, LP.  Upon conversion of the warrant for cash, the total gross amount raised by Ameri100 in this offering would be $10 million.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering principally for market expansion and strategic acquisitions.  Further, the Board adopted, and the Company’s shareholders approved, a 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan for executive officers, key employees, and directors.
President and Chief Executive Officer Giri Devanur said, “The technology services industry is going through a fundamental shift.  We are pioneering the outsourcing 3.0 era via our global partner ecosystem and bringing our Global 2000 customers a highly specialized offering with extreme agility.  We have developed innovative new products such as the Langer Index in conjunction with Dr. Langer of the Center for Technology Management at Columbia University.  We will soon be launching a SAP HANA version of the Langer Index.  In addition, we recently acquired Linear Logics, a Pennsylvania-based supply chain specialist company with an award winning SAP mobility product.”
In accordance with “reverse merger” accounting treatment, the Company’s historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Ameri and Partners prior to the merger in all future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Panamax Capital, LLC was the exclusive financial advisor and Warshaw Burstein, LLP was the legal advisor to Ameri and Partners in connection with the merger.  Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP represented AMERI Holdings, Inc. and Lone Star Value.
The securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be resold absent registration under, or exemption from registration under, such Act.

PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Transaction Highlights:

Acquisition price of approximately $5 million in cash and AMRH shares, plus the potential for a $1 million earn-out based on revenue and EBITDA performance in 2016 and 2017 
Bellsoft revenues estimated to be $20 million on an annual basis with adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 5-10%(1) 
Bellsoft's client base includes multiple Fortune 100 companies and other blue-chip clients 
Bellsoft will significantly expand AMERI's geographic presence in the southeastern U.S. 
Bellsoft adds over 175 highly-trained consultants, bringing AMERI's total resources count to approximately 225 
Aligns with AMERI's previously announced aggressive acquisition strategy 
Transaction expected to be immediately accretive to AMERI's earnings and cash flow on an adjusted basis
AMERI Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "Ameri100" or the "Company") (OTC: AMRH), a technology-management solutions firm that provides digital transformation and enterprise solutions to clients globally, today announced the acquisition of Bellsoft, Inc. ("Bellsoft"), a Lawrenceville, Georgia-based global systems integrator specializing in providing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), CRM, business intelligence (BI) and other web-based solutions.  The acquisition will significantly expand Ameri100's service lines and geographic presence in the southeast U.S. market.
"This is a landmark day for Ameri100's customers, partners, and employees across the globe," commented Giri Devanur, Chief Executive Officer of Ameri100.  Mr. Devanur further commented that, "Bellsoft is a well-established firm with 20 years of strategic consulting services to Fortune 100 clients."  The Company believes that with this acquisition it is well positioned to provide additional services in digital transformation and ERP solutions to all of its clients.
Paul Nathan, Executive Vice President of Bellsoft, added that, "Bellsoft and Ameri100 as a combined entity will experience accelerated growth due to a competitive cost structure and superior client offerings.  We are excited to deliver world-class solutions to our clients across the United States and globally."
According to CIO Review magazine, Ameri100 has been identified as one of the "50 most promising IT services companies in the U.S."  With the acquisition of Bellsoft, Ameri100 further demonstrates its commitment to strengthening its capabilities in delivering IT services and products around the world.  The acquisition serves as a critical boost to Ameri100's client acquisition plans and allows the Company to integrate its offshore business model with Bellsoft's US-based operations to create significant synergies.
Bellsoft has historically generated adjusted EBITDA margins in the 5-10% range, but Ameri100 plans to leverage its offshore expertise and seamlessly integrate its hybrid U.S.-based and India-based business model into Bellsoft's operations in order to reduce costs and increase margins over time.  Ameri100 believes that all synergies should be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2016.
Ameri100's Acquisition Strategy
Ameri100 has built a database of potential acquisition targets and is exploring multiple accretive acquisitions that will create value for Ameri100's shareholders.  These targets typically have strong financial health and operating performance, but with operations and employees primarily based in the U.S. expected profit margins for these firms are in the 5-10% range.  As Ameri100 makes acquisitions, its initial consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin could be lower than Ameri100's historical level of 15%, but margins are likely to be back up to Ameri100's historical level over time as operations of the acquired companies get fully integrated.  Ameri100 continues to have a long-term business plan of reaching $100 million in annual revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.
About AMERI HOLDINGS, Inc.
AMERI Holdings, Inc. is a technology management solutions firm that provides digital transformation and enterprise solutions to its clients globally.  Headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, with offices in Pune and Bangalore, India, the Company is a global leader in consulting and technology solutions. The Company has combined lean technology innovation and deep business process expertise to exceed client expectations, leveraging an extensive Lean Enterprise Architecture Partnership "LEAP" of over 4,500 technology associates worldwide.  The Company has assisted Global 2000 companies with architecture and technology solutions, enabling customers to transform businesses with the integration of seamless processes.  The Company has continuously invested in innovative solutions such as the Langer Index, SimpleAPO and IBP, which, it believes, have enhanced the competitive advantage of its clients.
