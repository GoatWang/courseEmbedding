Testimonials
Described as a firm “in a league by itself,” the boutique Las Vegas firm of Campbell & Williams is considered one of the leading litigation firms in the state.Described as a firm “in a league by itself,” the boutique Las Vegas firm of Campbell & Williams is considered one of the leading litigation firms in the state. Founding partners Donald Campbell and J. Colby Williams are uniformly praised by peers who commend the team’s skill and effectiveness, stating “We have worked on the same side and against the firm, and both Campbell & Williams are tremendous litigators and very good guys.” With representative clients including Donald Trump, CNN, Toshiba, The Wall Street Journal, and Andre Agassi Enterprises, the firm has seen repeated success against national entities including ExxonMobil, General Motors, Wal-Mart, and Chrysler Corporation.
Peer support for Campbell is unanimous, with descriptors like “excellent litigator,” “intimidating litigator,” and “the top guy in town” peppering conversations about him. One competitor confides, “If I had a conflict, I’d send a case to Don Campbell in a heartbeat. My only hesitation about doing so is that as a litigator, he’d show me up by a country mile!” As a former federal prosecutor with the Department of Justice, Campbell is highly regarded and has built a reputation as one of the preeminent lawyers in the state. Williams is a highly accomplished trial and appellate lawyer who has been responsible for precedent-setting cases within the state and specializes in commercial litigation claims, products liability, employment and professional liability.
-Benchmark: The Definitive Guide to America’s Leading Litigation Firms & Attorneys
(excerpts compiled from the 2008 -2012 editions)
 
This Las Vegas boutique has an impressive roster of clients, which includes household names such as Toshiba and The Wall Street Journal. In addition to its excellent commercial litigation practice, the group has a background in assisting on state and federal white-collar criminal investigations. "Excellent litigator" Donald Campbell focuses on personal injury and commercial torts. His 30-plus years in the field have seen a succession of notable court victories.  Colby Williams remains a prominent figure on appellate matters. His practice is split between commercial disputes, personal injury and white-collar criminal defense.
-Chambers USA
“Given the extraordinary large volume of high-profile jury trials conducted by the senior partners at Campbell & Williams, it hardly comes as any surprise that there has been abundant press coverage of the many record setting verdicts the firm has achieved.  As a result, major news organizations including ABC News, CNN, and MSNBC have called upon the firm, and particularly partner J. Colby Williams, to represent them in a wide variety of First Amendment related litigation.”
-Super Lawyers
“Donald J. Campbell wrote a brief that should reside in an art museum somewhere. It was devastating, brutal and absolutely hilarious, damn, it was a masterful piece of writing.  As sarcastic as William F. Buckley, with a dash of Jonathan Swift, maybe Clarence Darrow. If you need someone to carve the Thanksgiving turkey, put Don on your list. He conducted a deposition with the plaintiff that was painful to even read in a transcript."
-Citylife Reporter, George Knapp
“Dapper Don Campbell, is a bulldog in a Brioni suit.”
-Las Vegas Review Journal Reporter, John L. Smith

Description



Product Description
Phillip Patton
  Phillip is a full time Knife Maker who makes a range of knives from Swords to Camp Knives to Hunters.  He works with several types of Steel but prefers O-1.  His designs are extremely ergonomic and he tests each new blade style himself.  



  This is a Big Game Hunter from Phillip that feels just incredible in the hand.  It has a generous handle which allows for an extremely comfortable grip for both Small to Medium hands.   
The O-1 blade was ground from tough 3/16" thick stock but the Deep Hollow Grind will insure this knife is a superb cutter.  I love a wide blade and this Blade is 1  3/8" wide! 


  The handles are well contoured Natural Canvas Micarta that are secured with Loveless style Blind Bolts.  The Blade has a Drop to the Point but this knife has loads of belly that will make short work of any Skinning or Camp chore.  The Tang is aggressively Tapered making the knife lightweight and the balance is right where it should be.  Wonderful handle to blade ratio! 


The Thick Leather sheath is set up for RH Belt carry.  The knife sits low and snug in the Sheath.  

 A great package, alot of knife for the money!
