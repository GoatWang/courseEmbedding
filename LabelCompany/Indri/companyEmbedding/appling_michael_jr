Mr. Appling also held the position of CEO and President for United Scaffolding, Inc., an XServ, Inc. operating subsidiary. In February 2007, XServ, Inc. was sold to The Brock Group, a private industrial services company headquartered in Texas. From March 2000 to June 2002, Mr. Appling served as the Chief Financial Officer of CheMatch.com, an online commodities trading forum. ChemConnect, Inc., a venture backed independent trading exchange, acquired CheMatch.com in January 2002. From June 1999 to March 2000, Mr. Appling was Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Eco Corporation, a publicly traded, international fabrication, construction and maintenance provider to the energy, pulp and paper and power industries. Mr. Appling worked for ITEQ, Inc., a publicly traded, international fabrication and services company, from September 1997 to May 1999, first as a Director of Corporate Development and then as Vice President, Finance and Accounting. From July 1991 to September 1997, Mr. Appling worked at Arthur Andersen, where he practiced as a certified public accountant. We believe Mr. Appling is qualified to serve on our Board of Directors because of his extensive finance and accounting experience, as well as his executive leadership and management experience as a chief executive officer.
