Product Information


When I was a small kid, on summer vacation would go to the family farm in rural Illinois. I would constantly find arrowheads and these small medicine bottles from the past. So we took 5 shapes and had them cast to make small flower vases.
We have also seen some nice photos that have been sent up to us using them as glass wedding vases, with throws and clusters of them scattered down the table. The small flower vases come in five colors (peridot, light green, clear, light blue, and dark blue).
If you are thinking about using these as glass wedding vases, don’t over think it. There are so many good combinations, it really does not matter when they are clustered together. Basically, try to find an ugly one.
The Loft small flower vases are also great to have kicking around for clippings from the garden. 
Shapes available are: Bottle, Circle, Oval, Square, and Rectangle
The Loft Bottle is 2.25” in diameter, 3” tall.
The Loft Circle is 2.25” in diameter, 3” tall. 
The Loft Oval is 2.25” in diameter, 3” tall.
The Loft Square is 2.25” in diameter, 3” tall.
The Loft Rectangle is 2.25” in diameter, 3” tall.
Flowers We Love in this Vase: Spray Roses, Kermit mums, Freesia, Baby Cymbidium Orchids, Waxwing

Product Information



Yoke is one of the newest additions to our wall mounted plant holders. Yoke comes in a wide variety of rich colors to compliment any home and décor. Mount them easily on your wall using a screw or nail, depending on the type of wall, and hang these floral ceramic vases from the hole in the back.   Use one on a smaller wall or create your own design using three or six to add drama and make your guests think you are an interior designer!
Yoke can be used as wall mounted plant holders by filling them with air plants or even succulents, or Yoke can be used as floral ceramic vases, filled with a beautiful bouquet of your favorite flowers. These are the perfect pet friendly floral ceramic vases as well, because they keep your elegant arrangements out of your pet’s reach! Change things up by filling them with flowers one week and filling them with air plants the next.
They are beautiful with a wide range of plants and flowers. If you are using them as wall mounted plant holders try our favorite Tillandsia or use them a a floral ceramic vase.

The Yoke Planter is 3.5 inches long  x 8 inches wide x 8 inches tall.
Flowers and Plants we Love in this Planter: Harrisii, Cyanea, Caulescens, Parrot Tulips Gerber Daisy, Agapanthus, Cymbidium Orchids, Bird of Paradise

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
