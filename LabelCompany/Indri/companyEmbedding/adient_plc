On October 31, 2016, Adient plc (“Adient”) completed its separation from Johnson Controls International plc (“Johnson Controls”) and is now an independent, publicly traded company.

Value Trap: Adient Plc's Contradicting Growth Outlook - Adient plc (NASDAQ:ADNT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Value Trap: Adient Plc's Contradicting Growth OutlookJul.21.17 | About: Adient plc (ADNT) Centaur Investments Long/short equity, special situations, event-driven, valueSummaryGlobal auto production volumes appear to have peaked.Continued weak industry growth results in difficulty justifying meaningful future growth for the company and peers.Central banks tighten up on policy; foreign currency volatility will affect international sales revenue.New auto suppliers emerging in China threaten the Adient and Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems joint-venture.Introduction In late 2016, Centaur Investments published an article covering Johnson Control’s (NYSE:JCI) spin-off, Adient plc (NASDAQ:ADNT). Contrary to the valuation presented in the article, the market valued Adient's shares much higher. The shares were given a boost from the post-election bull market. Further, Adient received optimistic price targets from top analysts and a few favorable articles were published from the investment management community. The company still appears to present a seemingly attractive value opportunity. This article provides an update on Adient, as viewed by Centaur Investments. Investors are encouraged to read the initial article found here. The thesis presented in the initial article remains intact and is now supported further by material evidence which will be defended in this article. Moreover, new points have been added to the initial thesis that will set the tone for the equity valuation of the company. As before, the valuation segment of this article will examine the company against a few comparable firms. The motive underlying the thesis in this article may be applied to all manufacturers predominantly exposed to the automobile industry.  Business Recap  After completion of a merger between Johnson Controls International and Tyco International (NYSE:TYC), Adient was separated from parent company Johnson Controls in a late 2016 spinoff event. The company is the former automotive seating and interiors business component of the parent. The company operates as a supplier for the automotive industry by offering just-in-time automotive seating and interiors. Per 8-K filling, Adient is the world's largest automotive seating supplier based on production volumes and benefits from relationships with the largest global auto manufacturers. Adient operates in virtually every area of automotive seating including: seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests, trim covers and fabrics. Adient also produces instrument panels, floor consoles, door panels, overhead consoles, cockpit systems, decorative trim and other automotive products. Lastly, Adient manages approximately 230 manufacturing and assembly facilities and has operations in 33 countries.
 Thesis This narrative argument is that the ongoing downturn in retail auto sales appears to indicate that a near-term decline in revenue should be expected for automotive part makers, including Adient. More specifically, Adient faces pressures from slowing automobile manufacturing volumes, increased competition in China, and foreign exchange volatility (i.e. UK sterling slump). Additionally, the impact that sales to niche markets such as passenger aircraft manufacturing and sporting arena seating has been trivial. Sales in these niche markets will be insufficient to offset the automotive industry woes. Macroeconomic indicators further validate the projected downward trend that retail auto sales and automobile manufacturing volumes are likely to continue to follow. To summarize a few, have a look at the following visuals: Tightening has been observed in auto lending.

 

 Auto loan origination has been trending lower.

 The downward pressure on used vehicle values continues.


 As the Fed tightened policy, U.S. auto loan defaults increased.

 The latest readings indicate that U.S. consumer sentiment has begun to decline from post-election highs.

 The European market for vehicles has not been much better. Purchases of vehicles for the European Union were trivial, judging from the latest reading.

 In the UK, following the sharp decline of British pound-sterling, automobile purchases took a plunge as well.

 In addition, consumer and business optimism continues to be uncertain for the UK, with some corporations looking to relocate their operations to mainland Europe. Lastly, in the US auto market, light weight truck sales have started to decline as well. 


 Retail auto sales contracted during the first six months of the year and there is continued concern regarding downward momentum in used auto values. Further, as noted in the above graphics, some auto lenders have started limiting their exposure to subprime credit borrowers as loan-delinquencies and charge-offs increased in frequency. Auto analyst Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley recently warned of an "unprecedented buyer’s strike” producing additional headwinds to the automotive industry. Esha Dey’s Bloomberg article published in early June noted that the bank had “lowered their U.S. auto sales forecast by millions of units for each year through 2020.” 

 In the U.S., weak consumer spending has also appeared in retail and food aside from durable goods. When projecting long-term growth for auto sales, this may be something to consider. Additionally, the latest measure for North American auto sales, American auto manufacturers have started to cut back on fleet sales. Rental car companies such as Enterprise Holdings, Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HTZ) are important fleet buyers. At Enterprise, Senior Executive Kurt Kohler noted that “signs of declining used-vehicle prices heading into the year prompted Enterprise to narrow its shopping list,” as reported by Wall Street Journal. The End of Car Ownership An additional center piece of the short thesis on Adient PLC and peers such as Lear Corp. (NYSE:LEA) may be briefly summarized by a June 20th publishing by the Wall Street Journal titled: “The End of Car Ownership.” Most major industry analysts project an overall decline in the total volume of automobiles manufactured over the course of the next few years. Last year (2016) held the record for the highest volume of automobile sales in the United States since the start of recession with volumes totaling 17.55 million vehicles. At the six-month period ending June 30th, the pace in annual sales had slowed to 16.4 million vehicles. Taking a look back at an older note from Barclays, the analyst predicted continued vehicle sales declines as autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing take over.
 A few other behavioral factors can also be noted to predict a continued downtrend in automobile manufacturing. Among these are:  Changing consumer behavior and lifestyle preferences towards sustainable transport and ride-sharing; and low interest in owning automobiles and acquiring a driving license has been observed among youth.  Elaborating on these points, in practical sense, just as nuclear generation capacity has declined around the world - replaced by renewable energy, the internal combustion engine and the automobile driver might eventually be largely displaced as well. Under the pressure of high traffic congestion in the world’s largest transportation hubs, the quantity of vehicles on the road is likely going to be far lower in the long run. The millennial, the x, y, and z generations are showing less interest in owning a vehicle or learning how to drive. Today, human transportation is already only a summon away thanks to companies such as Lyft and Uber. These companies have facilitated travel without the need to fight for a parking spot or deal with automobile-related expenses such as insurance, routine maintenance or unexpected repairs. It is now more apparent that as auto mobile manufacturing volumes wind down, auto part suppliers are surely to see an adverse impact. Setting these macro headwinds aside for a moment, the cheap valuations among auto manufacturers and part suppliers seem appealing to investors. Upon careful consideration, there is a reason why these valuations are so. A few words of caution: AVOID THE VALUE TRAP. Market Sentiment and Analyst Opinions In sum, as financial markets continued to strengthen, negative sentiment has failed to dismay investor optimism. Yet, as of July 1st, 2017, shares of ADNT have failed to move higher despite encouraging price target ratings early on. Adient currently has an average "Buy/Overweight" recommendation from Wall Street Analysts. One major bank that stands out in its outlook for the company is Morgan Stanley, with an "Underweight" recommendation and $40 price target.
 

 While global auto sales are still quite robust, there does appear to be a clear indication of a trend in the direction of automobile sales. If this trend persists, spillovers will present an adverse impact on the sectors exposed to this industry downtrend. Adient’s historically slim margins and material exposure to the automotive industry will pin down the company’s future growth prospects. As the US Federal Reserve continues to raise the target on the Fed funds rate, rising interest rates will likely continue to pressure automobile loan performance and sales volumes. Now, how does all the information provided in this thesis affect Adient’s market valuation? The explanation is simple; as auto sales continue to fluctuate, shares of Adient are likely to remain at their current valuation unless a positive trend in global auto sales becomes apparent and depreciation in used vehicle prices stabilizes. If indeed auto sales continue to trend lower as the information appears to predict, Adient’s market valuation will surely decline. Valuation As the Adient plc discounted cash flow model is revisited, take into consideration the arguments presented in this article up to this point. Before diving into a snapshot of industry comparable companies, some main concerns the company is penalized for are reiterated; these include:  Ongoing and projected global auto sales declines; and current and future threats from autonomous transport Future accessibility to alternative transport (i.e. bicycles, rides-haring, hyperloops, etc.).  Industry Peers/Comps The image below contains a list of Adient’s industry peers presented for the reader. It is apparent that Adient is currently valued rather cheaply. A comparison of the company’s operating margin relative to peers reveals one reason for the cheap valuation. The discounted cash flow model and estimated valuation for the company are present next.
 

 Adient plc Valuation Model 

 In the valuation model above, the expectations for company growth have been lowered. As appropriate, the expected rate of return for the industry and financial markets overall was also lowered. Because of this observation, the discount factor is lower in this model than in the previous models found in the article published on November 2, 2016. In addition, Adient’s shares have been more correlated with the market so the Beta multiple found in the model was adjusted appropriately. The effective tax rate has been higher than initially estimated as well as the cost of debt. The model estimates Adient’s equity valuation to be $3.7 billion with a price target of $40 per share. The valuation indicates there may be approximately 40% downside to this company. This projection is reasonable given ongoing headwinds to the industry and it should be expected that upcoming earnings announcements may provide additional supporting information for investors. Conclusion  Referencing the initial article one last time, it was mentioned that management had plans to penetrate the market for autonomous vehicles. The article speculated that management would announce production plans for components other than seating and interiors for these vehicles. However, these plans are only an adapted form of the current business operations, now being applied to autonomous vehicles. In other words, Adient’s prospects for autonomous vehicles involves nothing more than a rearrangement of the automobile interior to accommodate the lack of forward-facing seats in future vehicles. This is one of those necessary changes the company needs to make to remain relevant within the industry.
 There will be a need to retool factories to accommodate new products along with additional operating expenses which will hold off any positive margin expansions. So, the implementation will come with strings attached; additional research and development spending and capital expenditures. The investor should consider these additional expenses along with the projected decline in automobile production volumes in the long run. The notion here is that free cash flows will likely be slimmer than current expectations. Eventually, the industry should stabilize as newer vehicles replace outgoing legacy autonomous vehicles. At that point, the company growth rate should converge to the projected perpetuity growth rate applied in the model presented here. In conclusion, there are some positives to the company and some of these have been highlighted by Kingstown Capital in a “Graham and Doddsville” publishing from Columbia University (page 9, issue 28). Making a careful analysis of Adient’s manufacturing scale, it is apparent that the company has economic moat. While the company has some of the worst margins in the industry, however great the company’s moat may be, it appears to be failing to produce economies of scale. Most importantly, the advent of autonomous transport and ride-sharing is a threat to the automotive industry. Given the current market capitalization of the company, investors appear to be unwilling to take serious logic to these threats. While Adient is likely to remain a major player in the industry in the long run, if the industry does indeed shrink, Adient appears destined to remain a value trap for investors.

The effective tax rate has been higher than initially estimated as well as the cost of debt. The model estimates Adient’s equity valuation to be $3.7 billion with a price target of $40 per share. The valuation indicates there may be approximately 40% downside to this company. This projection is reasonable given ongoing headwinds to the industry and it should be expected that upcoming earnings announcements may provide additional supporting information for investors. Conclusion  Referencing the initial article one last time, it was mentioned that management had plans to penetrate the market for autonomous vehicles. The article speculated that management would announce production plans for components other than seating and interiors for these vehicles. However, these plans are only an adapted form of the current business operations, now being applied to autonomous vehicles. In other words, Adient’s prospects for autonomous vehicles involves nothing more than a rearrangement of the automobile interior to accommodate the lack of forward-facing seats in future vehicles. This is one of those necessary changes the company needs to make to remain relevant within the industry.
 There will be a need to retool factories to accommodate new products along with additional operating expenses which will hold off any positive margin expansions. So, the implementation will come with strings attached; additional research and development spending and capital expenditures. The investor should consider these additional expenses along with the projected decline in automobile production volumes in the long run. The notion here is that free cash flows will likely be slimmer than current expectations. Eventually, the industry should stabilize as newer vehicles replace outgoing legacy autonomous vehicles. At that point, the company growth rate should converge to the projected perpetuity growth rate applied in the model presented here. In conclusion, there are some positives to the company and some of these have been highlighted by Kingstown Capital in a “Graham and Doddsville” publishing from Columbia University (page 9, issue 28). Making a careful analysis of Adient’s manufacturing scale, it is apparent that the company has economic moat. While the company has some of the worst margins in the industry, however great the company’s moat may be, it appears to be failing to produce economies of scale. Most importantly, the advent of autonomous transport and ride-sharing is a threat to the automotive industry. Given the current market capitalization of the company, investors appear to be unwilling to take serious logic to these threats. While Adient is likely to remain a major player in the industry in the long run, if the industry does indeed shrink, Adient appears destined to remain a value trap for investors.

Adient shares expected to begin trading on the NYSE Oct. 31, 2016



CORK, Ireland, Sept. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI) today announced its board of directors has approved the previously announced spin-off of its global automotive seating and interiors business.  The transaction will result in two independent, publicly traded companies: Johnson Controls International plc and Adient plc.  The spin-off is expected to be completed on Oct. 31, 2016.  
At the time of the separation, Adient will be the world's largest global automotive seating supplier, supporting all major automakers in differentiating vehicles through superior quality, technology and performance. Johnson Controls will continue to operate as a global leader in building products and technology, integrated solutions and energy storage.
"Today's announcement is an important step as Adient continues on its path toward becoming an independent company," said incoming Adient Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R. Bruce McDonald. "As the market leader in the automotive seating industry, Adient is well-positioned for growth and margin expansion as we commit to reinvesting in the business on a global basis."
The separation will occur by means of the declaration of a dividend in specie of the automotive seating and interiors business, to be effected by the transfer of the automotive seating and interiors business from Johnson Controls to Adient plc and the issuance of ordinary shares of Adient directly to holders of Johnson Controls ordinary shares on a pro rata basis.
The distribution is expected to occur prior to the open of business on Oct. 31, 2016.  Each Johnson Controls shareholder will receive one ordinary share of Adient for every 10 ordinary shares of Johnson Controls held as of the close of business on Oct. 19, 2016, the record date for the distribution. No fractional shares of Adient will be issued; Johnson Controls shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. No action or payment is required by Johnson Controls shareholders to receive ordinary shares of Adient in the distribution.
Adient ordinary shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Oct. 31, 2016 under the symbol "ADNT."  The company expects "when-issued" trading for Adient ordinary shares to begin Oct. 17, 2016 and continue through Oct. 28, 2016.
Beginning on Oct. 17, 2016 and continuing through Oct. 28, 2016, it is expected that there will be two markets in Johnson Controls ordinary shares: Johnson Controls shares that trade in the "regular-way" market will trade with an entitlement to Adient ordinary shares to be distributed pursuant to the distribution; shares that trade in the "ex-distribution" market will trade without an entitlement to Adient ordinary shares. 
Adient Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R. Bruce McDonald and other members of the Adient executive management team will provide an in-depth review of Adient's business, including Adient's leading market positions, China operations and JV structure, innovative products and technology, financial expectations and FY 2017 outlook on Sept. 15, 2016, in New York City. To participate in the meeting via a live webcast, visit Johnson Controls' Investor Relations website at http://investors.johnsoncontrols.com/. 
Johnson Controls shareholders are urged to consult their financial and tax advisors regarding the particular consequences of the distribution in their situation, including, without limitation, the specific implications of selling Adient ordinary shares and the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax laws. Johnson Controls shareholders who hold Johnson Controls ordinary shares before the distribution date should consult with their stockbroker, bank or other nominee to understand whether their Johnson Controls shares will be sold with or without the entitlement to Adient ordinary shares pursuant to the distribution.
Information regarding Adient and its business, including details of the separation and distribution, is included in Adient's Registration Statement on Form 10, which Adient has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is available at http://www.sec.gov. The Registration Statement also identifies certain risks of owning Adient ordinary shares.
The separation and distribution of Adient ordinary shares is subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, the SEC's having declared effective the Form 10.  Johnson Controls' Board of Directors may cancel the distribution at any time prior to the distribution.

All statements in this document other than statements of historical fact are statements that are, or could be, deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In this document, statements regarding Johnson Controls' future financial position, sales, costs, earnings, cash flows, other measures of results of operations, capital expenditures or debt levels and plans, objectives, outlook, targets, guidance or goals are forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "should," "forecast," "project" or "plan" or terms of similar meaning are also generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Johnson Controls cautions that these statements are subject to numerous important risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond Johnson Controls' control, that could cause Johnson Controls' actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, among others, risks related to:  uncertainties as to the timing of the spin-off and whether it will be completed, the possibility that various closing conditions for the spin-off may not be satisfied or waived, the expected tax treatment of the spin-off, the impact of the spin-off on the businesses of Johnson Controls and Adient, the risk that disruptions from the spin-off will harm Johnson Controls' business, competitive responses to the spin-off, general economic and business conditions that affect Johnson Controls and Adient following the spin-off, the strength of the U.S. or other economies, automotive vehicle production levels, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, the availability of raw materials and component products, currency exchange rates, and cancellation of or changes to commercial arrangements.  A detailed discussion of risks related to Johnson Controls' business is included in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in each of Johnson Controls, Inc.'s and Tyco International plc's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year filed with the SEC on November 18, 2015 and November 13, 2015, respectively, and in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed by each company with the SEC after such date, available at www.sec.gov and www.johnsoncontrols.com under the "Investors" tab, as well as the Form 10 registration statement filed by Adient Limited and the amendments thereto. Shareholders, potential investors and others should consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and should not place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this document, unless otherwise specified, and, except as required by law, Johnson Controls assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this document.

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.
