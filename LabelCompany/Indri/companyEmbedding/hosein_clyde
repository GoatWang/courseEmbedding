Santa Clara, California

                  (May 29, 2008) –

          arvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL), a leader in storage, communications, and consumer silicon solutions, today announced it has named Clyde R. Hosein Chief Financial Officer, effective June 23rd, 2008.
Mr. Hosein brings to Marvell more than 25 years of experience in finance and operations in high technology industries. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Hosein was chief financial officer for Integrated Device Technologies (IDT) and held the same position at Advanced Interconnect Technologies (AIT). Before joining Advanced Interconnect Technologies, Mr. Hosein was the chief financial officer and senior director of corporate planning of Candescent Technologies Corporation. Previous to Candescent, Mr. Hosein spent over 14 years with IBM Corporation, where he held several positions within their storage, microelectronics, data systems and corporate divisions.
“Clyde has extensive financial management experience in the tech sector as well as a strong record of improving operations within the organizations he has served,” said Sehat Sutardja, Marvell’s Chief Executive Officer. “I am confident that his past experience and proven leadership will help him guide Marvell as we continue to build a solid platform for growth. We are very pleased to welcome Clyde to the Marvell team."
“I’m extremely impressed with Marvell’s history of innovation, market leadership, and their commitment to excellence,” said Hosein. “I believe my background and expertise are an excellent fit for this world-class organization as it embarks on its next phase of growth and I am looking forward to helping the Marvell team achieve the next level of excellence.” 
Mr. Hosein holds an M.B.A. from New York University Stern School of Business and a B.S. in industrial engineering from Polytechnic University in New York. He is a member of the Board of Directors for Cree Inc., where he serves on the Audit and Governance and Nominating committees, having previously served on the Compensation Committee.
Mr. Hosein’s appointment is concurrent with the transition of George de Urioste, who has served as interim Chief Financial Officer since January 2008 to a new role as Acting Chief Operating Officer, covering a broad range of responsibilities. Pantas Sutardja, who has been serving as Acting COO, will relinquish those responsibilities in order to devote his full attention to his role as Chief Technology Officer (CTO).
“We want to thank George for his excellent service as interim chief financial officer,” said Mr. Sutardja. “George has been an integral member of the Marvell management team for the past few months, and we look forward to his continued leadership as acting chief operating officer.”
