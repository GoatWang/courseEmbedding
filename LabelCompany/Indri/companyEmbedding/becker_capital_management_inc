Company Description


Becker Capital Management offers the following products: All Cap Value Equity, All Cap Value Equity with ETFs, Large Cap Value Equity, Balanced, Balanced with ETFs and Fixed Income. Becker employs a value-driven investment process based on bottom-up fundamental analysis. Their products include all-cap value equity and large-cap value equity. Becker uses proprietary screens to isolate undervalued investments. Their approach is bottom-up, focusing on fundamentally sound companies that are out of favor. Low p/e ratios are important, but Becker also looks for growth stocks that have fallen out of favor and are trading at reasonable prices. When the market rediscovers these stocks, the firm sells and moves on to the next opportunity.Becker's fixed income philosophy focuses on identifying active, value oriented and conservative fixed income investments. The firm focuses on treasury, agency, municipal, and investment grade corporate bonds, maximizing diversification from the client's other assets. Fixed income portfolios generally have a short to intermediate duration and bonds are rarely purchased with a maturity greater than 20 years. Becker actively manages the duration, sector allocation and credit exposure of client fixed income portfolios. They determine what they believe to be the optimal maturity structure and duration based on expectations for inflation, Federal Reserve policy and historical value relationships along the yield curve. Relative sector value is taken into consideration, as well as the prospects of individual corporate credits. Becker favors conservative structure and credit exposure
