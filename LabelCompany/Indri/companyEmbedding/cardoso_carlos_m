Kennametal CEO Cardoso to Retire in December
Board of Directors Commences Search as Part of Seamless Transition
LATROBE, Pa., (Aug. 19, 2014) – Kennametal Inc. (NYSE: KMT) today announced that Chairman, President and CEO Carlos Cardoso has decided to retire from the company effective on December 31, 2014.  This will be a seamless leadership transition as the company’s board of directors commences its search for Cardoso’s successor, which members expect to complete before the end of the year.  The search process will consider both internal and external candidates. 
Cardoso has served as Kennametal president and CEO since January 2006, and was elected chairman two years later. He joined the company in April 2003 as president of its Metalworking Solutions and Services Group and subsequently was appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
"Carlos Cardoso has served well as a strong leader through an important time in the company’s history," said Kennametal Lead Director William R. Newlin, chairman of Newlin Investment LLC.  "We appreciate the efforts Carlos has made on behalf of the company and look forward to working together with him to achieve a smooth transition in leadership."  
"I've often said to our employees and publicly that seven to ten years is the optimum time period for a chief executive to manage most effectively. With this in mind, I’ve worked regularly with the board on management succession,"  said Cardoso.  "Everyone at Kennametal has worked very hard in recent years to establish a good long-range plan, solid strategies, and we now have a complete and effective management team in place.  With that in mind, this has emerged as the best time to engage in a smooth leadership transition."
Named one of America’s "Best Chief Executive Officers" (Institutional Investor), Cardoso is immediate past chairman of the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation (MAPI); on the U.S. Manufacturing Council; and on the board of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).

Carlos Cardoso Receives Fairfield University Award
FAIRFIELD, Conn. (April 8, 2013) -- Fairfield University’s 26th Annual Fairfield Awards Dinner, “Celebrating a Tradition of Opportunity,” will be held Wednesday, April 10, 2013, at the Grand Hyatt New York in New York City. The Fairfield Awards Dinner benefits the Fairfield University Multicultural Scholarship Fund and is Fairfield University’s major fundraising event.

This year’s Awards Dinner features as keynote speaker Cynthia R. Bigelow, President & CEO, Bigelow Tea, a family-owned company headquartered in Fairfield, Conn., and the national market leader of specialty teas, employing 330 people across three manufacturing facilities and producing over 1.6 billion tea bags annually.

The Fairfield Awards Dinner will also recognize alumni, faculty, and staff for the highest levels of professional achievement, outstanding leadership, academic excellence, and meritorious service. The 2013 dinner honorees are the following:

Alumni Professional Achievement Award, Carlos M. Cardoso '81, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Kennametal Inc., a leading industrial technology company that develops highly engineered tooling, advanced materials, and expertise to diverse sectors in industrial production, transportation, energy, and infrastructure.

Alumni Service Award, Robert L. Berchem '62, P'92, Principal and President of Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C., one of Connecticut’s most prominent law firms. A former Fairfield University trustee, Mr. Berchem served as co-chairman of the Class of 1962’s 50th Reunion Gift Committee. Over sixty percent of the class participated, raising the largest 50th Reunion class gift in Fairfield’s history.

Honorary Alumna, Nancy Lynch, P'95, a significant role-player in the recruiting and mentoring of members of the first advisory board for the University’s School of Nursing. The auditorium in the School of Nursing was named The Nancy Lynch Auditorium in 2008.

Distinguished Faculty/Administrator Award, Eugene Doris, Fairfield University Director of Athletics, who has been with Fairfield University since 1994 and under whose guidance the University has expanded to 20 varsity sports and a solid Division I standing.

The Fairfield Award, James P. and Linda C. Slattery, P'92, and the Slattery Family, who established a foundation to support scholarships at Fairfield University named in honor of Chris Slattery ’92, who died in the World Trade Center attacks.

Fairfield Awards Dinner Co-Chairs are Bill and Peggy Atwell, P'08, Frank '89 and Susan Carroll, and Gavin and Marybeth O'Connor '88.

View full sizeMark Duncan, Associated PressGina Johnson performs leak tests on hydraulic fittings at the Eaton Corp. plant in Berea in January. 
For decades, good manufacturing jobs allowed workers to own homes and cars, take nice family vacations, satisfy their health care needs, send children to college and retire with financial security. 
The importance of this group -- the manufacturing middle class -- to the United States has been immeasurable. Manufacturing jobs created a vision of American life that led immigrants around the world to our shores. 
As chairman, president and CEO of Kennametal Inc., I have personally witnessed the American dream become a reality for many of our employees, including the 280 who work at our durable steel engineered solutions and standards facility in Solon and the additional 720 at our three other Ohio-based locations. 
As the middle class began to shift from manufacturing to service, the U.S. economy and the middle class began to experience a steady but sharp decline. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, manufacturing gross domestic product dropped 40 percent from 1980 to 2007. After-tax income for the middle 60 percent of Americans fell 7 percent during the same time period. 
Manufacturers were challenged to comply with noncompetitive tax codes and policies and forced to make the decision to remain competitive or go under, which essentially put the manufacturing middle class out of business. 
Contrast this trend with a regression analysis performed by our data research team at Kennametal, which found every one-point increase in manufacturing activity translates to 0.4 percent growth in middle class income. 
The absence of this powerful, positive link has contributed to the financial pressure on the middle class during the last several years. Yet it is also part of how we must once again restore the vision and the reality of a strong manufacturing middle class. 
The economy today is obviously different from a generation ago. Yet, if the middle class is to rise again, American manufacturing must also rebound. 
The challenge is no longer about numbers. It is about perception and overcoming it. 
Today, manufacturing is alive and well in this country, leading the economic recovery. 
We see it every day at Kennametal, which sits on the front end of the supply line as a global leader in innovative custom and standard wear-resistant solutions for demanding environments. 
Right now, nearly 1 million U.S. manufacturing jobs are unfilled, including hundreds at Kennametal. Recent economic forecasts from the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation predict manufacturing production will significantly outpace the overall economy and grow 3.4 percent this year, adding another 170,000 jobs along the way. 
At the same time, however, the National Association of Manufacturers' estimates reveal that nearly 2.7 million manufacturing workers will retire in the next decade and that demand for skilled labor will increase. The problem for manufacturing isn't the availability of jobs but rather the ability to find skilled workers to fill these jobs. 

As the last large publicly traded company in our industry still headquartered in the United States, we recognize training is critical to remaining competitive and rebuilding the middle class. 
In Pennsylvania, Kennametal recently completed its first high school "Young Engineers" pilot program to educate and inspire the next generation of skilled American manufacturing engineers. This fall, we will offer the program at Solon High School. Our Kennametal Foundation also supports a manufacturing partnership in the form of an apprenticeship program at Auburn Career Center. 
Although we do our part to offer unique educational and training opportunities to current and prospective employees, we also understand these efforts alone will not solve all of our industry's problems. 
Regulations place American manufacturers at a 20 percent competitive disadvantage compared with our nine largest trading partners. We need to examine tax-rate, tax-credit and tax-code solutions to help bridge that gap. It's time to reintroduce manufacturing to the middle class. It will require common sense and the combined efforts of industry, education and government to make it happen. 
A prosperous middle class doesn't result from economic growth -- it drives economic growth, and recapturing the American dream starts with the manufacturing middle class. 

Carlos M. Cardoso is chairman, president and CEO of Latrobe, Pa.-based Kennametal Inc., a global manufacturing leader in innovative custom- and standard-wear-resistant solutions for demanding environments with 13,000 employees in 60 countries around the world. He is chairman of the Manufacturer's Alliance/MAPI and co-chairman of the Pennsylvania Governor's Manufacturing Council, which is tasked with identifying and prioritizing top issues to sustain and advance manufacturing in the commonwealth.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Carlos Cardoso has the following 7 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Psychiatry
    A psychiatrist is a doctor with specific training in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.


    He or she can not only provide the counseling necessary to both diagnose and treat a patient, but can also prescribe medication when needed. In some cases, a psychiatrist will only provide the medication and the counseling will be provided by another healthcare specialist, like a certified counselor or psychologist.


    Like other doctors, psychiatrists employ diagnostic tools like CT scans and MRI in order to observe the structure and function of a patient's brain.


    Once a diagnosis is made, these specialists may use behavior or cognitive therapy in order to address the patient's condition, or a multitude of other types of therapy, in conjunction with or in place of medication.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
