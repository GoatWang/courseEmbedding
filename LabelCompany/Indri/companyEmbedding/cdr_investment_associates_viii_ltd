      We were founded on a simple premise: good investments result from sound decision-making; and, good businesses are built with a commitment to operational excellence.  Since our founding in 1978, we have never wavered from these principles.
      

            Good investments result
            from sound decision-making;
            and, good businesses are
            built with a commitment to
            operational excellence
          
      We work collaboratively with corporate and family business sellers on transactions to maximize value.  Many corporations, CEOs and entrepreneurs select CD&R as their partner because of our strong reputation for trustworthiness and operational leadership.
      
      We practice investing as a craft, relying on a dedicated and cohesive team with a shared sense of purpose and values.  Our investment approach blends skilled investment judgment with extensive experience driving growth and operating excellence.

Firm History

			We were founded in 1978 by Joe Rice, a former corporate lawyer from Sullivan & Cromwell and former investment banker; Martin Dubilier, a former McKinsey & Company partner and experienced corporate executive; Gene Clayton, a well-known crisis manager; and Bill Welsh, also a proven operating executive from Raytheon.  With 35 years of history, CD&R today is recognized as one of the most experienced and respected private equity firms.  We have institutionalized our distinctive approach to private equity investing – an approach that has become the reference point for blending investment skills with operating capabilities to build great businesses.
			
			Our reputation as a business builder was established by such landmark transactions as the buyout of Harris Graphics in 1983, at the time one of the largest ever corporate divestiture accomplished by means of a private equity buyout structure, and the creation of Lexmark International from IBM’s printer and supplies business in 1991.  The Firm and its investments have been the subject of numerous articles, including several case studies in the Harvard Business Review (“HBR”).  In a 1995 HBR article that focused on the Firm and its culture, the authors concluded that CD&R provides important “insights into what constitutes best practice in the ownership and governance of corporate enterprises.”  David Swenson, Chief Investment Officer of the Yale Investment Management Company, in his book Pioneering Portfolio Management (2009) stated that “by combining operational and financial skills, CD&R exemplifies the potential for unusual value creation.”
			
			Joe Rice assumed the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 1991. Don Gogel became Chief Executive Officer in 1999 and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2012.  Jack Welch, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of General Electric, became a Senior Advisor in 2001, and Sir Terry Leahy, former Chief Executive of Tesco, became a Senior Advisor in 2011, supplementing the Firm’s renowned group of full-time operating partners from some of the world’s most successful companies as well as operating advisors who are engaged by our funds.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.
Learn More



Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.
Get Started



Client Resources


Through your relationship with your Raymond James advisor, industry-leading resources are at your fingertips. You will have access to timely account information and research whenever and wherever you need it through Investor Access, which allows you to track and monitor all of your accounts in one safe and secure place.

About Raymond James


Since day one, we have always put our clients first. Your financial well-being is our focus. And we have never lost sight of that. Our advisors take a client-first approach and have the independence to serve you as you see fit. With a conservative approach to investing and a commitment to integrity, your advisor is backed by the size and resources of Raymond James, while also having the ability to maintain a small-firm feel. This gives you the attention and support you need to reach your goals.

Save a little more today,

Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html
