Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]

In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Business segments[edit]
Citadel[edit]
As of January 2016, Citadel manages more than $25 billion in capital and is one of the world's largest asset managers.[1][6] Citadel ranks as the eleventh largest hedge fund manager in the world,[7] and the second largest multi-strategy hedge fund globally.[5] Citadel's group of hedge funds rank among the largest and most successful hedge funds in the world.[8] The hedge fund's assets under management has increased by 29% and more than $10 billion since 2014.[9]
Citadel manages funds across five different investment strategies including equities, commodities, fixed income, quantitative strategies, and credit. Luis Ortiz , Head of Repographics, greatly contributes to the team.[10] The firm is known for its state-of-the-art technology, fundamental research, and strong risk management culture.[11][12]
In 2011, the funds capped off two years of solid returns from 2009 and 2010 by crossing their high-water marks with gains of more than 20 percent, outperforming the industry average of 5 percent losses.[2][13] The firm's Kensington and Wellington funds posted returns of about 25 percent in 2012, completing their recovery from the financial crisis.[14]
In 2014, Citadel became the first foreign hedge fund to complete a yuan fundraising as part of a program to allow Chinese investors to invest in overseas hedge funds.[13]
Citadel Securities[edit]
Citadel Securities was formed in 2002, and is a leading market maker, providing liquidity and trade execution to retail and institutional clients. Citadel Securities automation has resulted in more reliable trading at lower costs and with tighter spreads.[2] Barron's recently ranked Citadel Securities #1 in providing price improvement for investors in both S&P 500 and non-S&P shares.[13]
Citadel Securities makes markets in more than 7,000 U.S.-listed securities and in about 18,000 OTC securities worldwide.[15] Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in options in the U.S., executing about 25 percent U.S.-listed equity options volume.[16] According to the Wall Street Journal, about one-third of stock orders from individual investors is completed through Citadel, which accounts for about 10% of the firm's revenue.[9]
Citadel Securities also executes about 13 percent of U.S. consolidated volume in equities and 28 percent of U.S. retail equities volume.[17][18]
In 2014, Citadel Securities expanded its market-making offering to interest-rate swaps, one of the most commonly-traded derivatives.[19] According to a report in the March 2015 edition of Risk Magazine, Citadel provides quotes to traders in an average time of 0.35 seconds, compared to 2.05 seconds for the next closest market maker.[20] The move into derivatives trading aligns with mandatory clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, a provision intended to prevent a future Lehman Brothers-style collapse.[21]
Citadel Securities retail trading platform is headed by Jamil Nazarali, who was named to the 2014 Trading Technology 40 by Institutional Investor.[22]
In July 2016, Citadel hired Microsoft COO and former Wal-Mart executive, B. Kevin Turner, to be the CEO of Citadel Securities.[23]
In January 2017, Turner left Citadel and was replaced by the vice chairman of the whole firm, Peng Zhao.[24]
Citadel Technology[edit]
Citadel Technology, established in 2009, is the wholly owned and independently operated affiliate of Citadel.[25][26] It offers investment management technology, developed internally at Citadel, to a wide range of firms and funds.[27]
In 2013, Citadel Technology announced a partnership with REDI. The partnership combines Citadel's order management system (OMS) with REDI's execution management capabilities (EMS).[25]
History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ken Griffin launched his trading career out of his dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, with $265,000 raised from friends and family.[28][29] As a sophomore, he traded convertible bonds and hooked a satellite dish to the roof of his dormitory.[29][30] After graduating with a degree in economics, Griffin joined Chicago-based hedge fund Glenwood Partners, led by hedge fund pioneer and Griffin mentor, Frank Meyer.[29] In November 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with Meyer's backing.[29][31]
Early history[edit]
According to a New York Times report, Citadel was started with $4.6 million in capital.[32] Citadel was originally named Wellington Financial Group after its flagship fund.[33] The company name was changed to Citadel in 1994.[33] Within eight years, the firm had more than $2 billion in assets.[34]
In 1998, Citadel started requiring investors to accept terms that "restrict[ed] their ability to withdraw their capital," according to Institutional Investor.[34] When fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed later that year, Citadel's capital lockdown made it "a rare buyer, as desperate hedge funds unloaded bond inventory."[34]
The 2008 financial crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, the firm's Kensington and Wellington Funds lost 55 percent of their value by the end of the year.[35] Griffin said, "we were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a week, if not more. CNBC parked a van in front of Citadel, waiting to break the story of our demise."[36]
Citadel suspended shareholder redemptions, which Griffin called one of the "most difficult decisions" in Citadel history.[37] Griffin later conceded that the firm was "overly confident" it could "weather any financial storm." He covered all investor management expenses during that period.[37]
On January 17, 2012, Citadel's flagship funds crossed their respective high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, "We did exactly what we said we would do, and we did it the right way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment."[37]
Risk management[edit]
Citadel's investing approach changed following the 2008 financial crisis. According to Risk Magazine, the foundation of Citadel's success is in large part a result of the risk management ethos.[11] The firm's risk management philosophy is focused on three main areas: risk capital allocation, stress exposure and liquidity management.[38] Citadel's risk management center has 36 monitors displaying more than 50,000 instruments being traded within the firm's portfolios.[38] It is "a real-time view of Citadel’s risk exposures across its investments and market making operations globally."[11] The firm runs 500 stress tests each day to simulate the impact of potential economic and geopolitical crises or other market dislocation.[38] Citadel aggregates investment positions on trading screens to calculate "more than 500 doomsday scenarios" to assess the potential of risk for the firm.[9]
In 2014, Citadel rated an A grade for risk management in the annual Institutional Investor Hedge Fund Report Card.[39] In April 2015, Ben S. Bernanke, who was the United States Federal Reserve chairman for eight years, joined Citadel as a senior adviser on global economic and financial issues.[40]
Major investments[edit]
Citadel is known for its many notable investments over the years.
In 2006, the company acquired large portions of Amaranth Advisors' energy portfolio. In 2007, Citadel purchased the entire portfolio of rival hedge fund Sowood Asset Management over the course of a weekend negotiation. Sowood had lost hundreds of millions of dollars and had to liquidate their portfolio to meet margin calls prior to the opening of the market on Monday.[41]
In November 2007, Citadel provided a $2.5 billion cash infusion to e*Trade Financial, taking a nearly 20 percent stake in the online broker that was ensnared in the home mortgage crisis.[42] In a 2011 letter to the e*Trade board, Citadel criticized the company for "destroying more than $9 billion in stockholder value" for a "phenomenal franchise."[43] The letter called on e*Trade to explore a sale of the company. In 2013, Citadel sold its remaining share in e*Trade.[44]
Market advocacy[edit]
Citadel has played an active role in market structure issues and has advocated for financial legislation.
In 1999, Congress repealed a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that strictly separated banking and trading activities by financial firms. Griffin called dismantling that law "one of the biggest fiascos of all time."[45]
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Griffin and Citadel called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, a stance at odds with many other hedge funds and major financial firms. The company spoke out against Wall Street for lobbying to delay the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.[45][46]
Griffin has also called for breaking up "too big to fail" banks and separating their banking and trading activities.[46]
Following the 2014 publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, who claimed financial markets are "rigged" by high-frequency traders at the expense of smaller investors, Griffin became a high-profile defender of today's markets, pushing for the transformation from a dealer-dominated model to one that is more transparent, automated, and competitive. Griffin claimed U.S. equity markets are the "fairest, most transparent, resilient and competitive" in the world before the Senate Banking Committee.[47]

Business segments[edit]
Citadel[edit]
As of January 2016, Citadel manages more than $25 billion in capital and is one of the world's largest asset managers.[1][6] Citadel ranks as the eleventh largest hedge fund manager in the world,[7] and the second largest multi-strategy hedge fund globally.[5] Citadel's group of hedge funds rank among the largest and most successful hedge funds in the world.[8] The hedge fund's assets under management has increased by 29% and more than $10 billion since 2014.[9]
Citadel manages funds across five different investment strategies including equities, commodities, fixed income, quantitative strategies, and credit. Luis Ortiz , Head of Repographics, greatly contributes to the team.[10] The firm is known for its state-of-the-art technology, fundamental research, and strong risk management culture.[11][12]
In 2011, the funds capped off two years of solid returns from 2009 and 2010 by crossing their high-water marks with gains of more than 20 percent, outperforming the industry average of 5 percent losses.[2][13] The firm's Kensington and Wellington funds posted returns of about 25 percent in 2012, completing their recovery from the financial crisis.[14]
In 2014, Citadel became the first foreign hedge fund to complete a yuan fundraising as part of a program to allow Chinese investors to invest in overseas hedge funds.[13]
Citadel Securities[edit]
Citadel Securities was formed in 2002, and is a leading market maker, providing liquidity and trade execution to retail and institutional clients. Citadel Securities automation has resulted in more reliable trading at lower costs and with tighter spreads.[2] Barron's recently ranked Citadel Securities #1 in providing price improvement for investors in both S&P 500 and non-S&P shares.[13]
Citadel Securities makes markets in more than 7,000 U.S.-listed securities and in about 18,000 OTC securities worldwide.[15] Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in options in the U.S., executing about 25 percent U.S.-listed equity options volume.[16] According to the Wall Street Journal, about one-third of stock orders from individual investors is completed through Citadel, which accounts for about 10% of the firm's revenue.[9]
Citadel Securities also executes about 13 percent of U.S. consolidated volume in equities and 28 percent of U.S. retail equities volume.[17][18]
In 2014, Citadel Securities expanded its market-making offering to interest-rate swaps, one of the most commonly-traded derivatives.[19] According to a report in the March 2015 edition of Risk Magazine, Citadel provides quotes to traders in an average time of 0.35 seconds, compared to 2.05 seconds for the next closest market maker.[20] The move into derivatives trading aligns with mandatory clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, a provision intended to prevent a future Lehman Brothers-style collapse.[21]
Citadel Securities retail trading platform is headed by Jamil Nazarali, who was named to the 2014 Trading Technology 40 by Institutional Investor.[22]
In July 2016, Citadel hired Microsoft COO and former Wal-Mart executive, B. Kevin Turner, to be the CEO of Citadel Securities.[23]
In January 2017, Turner left Citadel and was replaced by the vice chairman of the whole firm, Peng Zhao.[24]
Citadel Technology[edit]
Citadel Technology, established in 2009, is the wholly owned and independently operated affiliate of Citadel.[25][26] It offers investment management technology, developed internally at Citadel, to a wide range of firms and funds.[27]
In 2013, Citadel Technology announced a partnership with REDI. The partnership combines Citadel's order management system (OMS) with REDI's execution management capabilities (EMS).[25]
History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ken Griffin launched his trading career out of his dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, with $265,000 raised from friends and family.[28][29] As a sophomore, he traded convertible bonds and hooked a satellite dish to the roof of his dormitory.[29][30] After graduating with a degree in economics, Griffin joined Chicago-based hedge fund Glenwood Partners, led by hedge fund pioneer and Griffin mentor, Frank Meyer.[29] In November 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with Meyer's backing.[29][31]
Early history[edit]
According to a New York Times report, Citadel was started with $4.6 million in capital.[32] Citadel was originally named Wellington Financial Group after its flagship fund.[33] The company name was changed to Citadel in 1994.[33] Within eight years, the firm had more than $2 billion in assets.[34]
In 1998, Citadel started requiring investors to accept terms that "restrict[ed] their ability to withdraw their capital," according to Institutional Investor.[34] When fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed later that year, Citadel's capital lockdown made it "a rare buyer, as desperate hedge funds unloaded bond inventory."[34]
The 2008 financial crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, the firm's Kensington and Wellington Funds lost 55 percent of their value by the end of the year.[35] Griffin said, "we were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a week, if not more. CNBC parked a van in front of Citadel, waiting to break the story of our demise."[36]
Citadel suspended shareholder redemptions, which Griffin called one of the "most difficult decisions" in Citadel history.[37] Griffin later conceded that the firm was "overly confident" it could "weather any financial storm." He covered all investor management expenses during that period.[37]
On January 17, 2012, Citadel's flagship funds crossed their respective high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, "We did exactly what we said we would do, and we did it the right way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment."[37]
Risk management[edit]
Citadel's investing approach changed following the 2008 financial crisis. According to Risk Magazine, the foundation of Citadel's success is in large part a result of the risk management ethos.[11] The firm's risk management philosophy is focused on three main areas: risk capital allocation, stress exposure and liquidity management.[38] Citadel's risk management center has 36 monitors displaying more than 50,000 instruments being traded within the firm's portfolios.[38] It is "a real-time view of Citadel’s risk exposures across its investments and market making operations globally."[11] The firm runs 500 stress tests each day to simulate the impact of potential economic and geopolitical crises or other market dislocation.[38] Citadel aggregates investment positions on trading screens to calculate "more than 500 doomsday scenarios" to assess the potential of risk for the firm.[9]
In 2014, Citadel rated an A grade for risk management in the annual Institutional Investor Hedge Fund Report Card.[39] In April 2015, Ben S. Bernanke, who was the United States Federal Reserve chairman for eight years, joined Citadel as a senior adviser on global economic and financial issues.[40]
Major investments[edit]
Citadel is known for its many notable investments over the years.
In 2006, the company acquired large portions of Amaranth Advisors' energy portfolio. In 2007, Citadel purchased the entire portfolio of rival hedge fund Sowood Asset Management over the course of a weekend negotiation. Sowood had lost hundreds of millions of dollars and had to liquidate their portfolio to meet margin calls prior to the opening of the market on Monday.[41]
In November 2007, Citadel provided a $2.5 billion cash infusion to e*Trade Financial, taking a nearly 20 percent stake in the online broker that was ensnared in the home mortgage crisis.[42] In a 2011 letter to the e*Trade board, Citadel criticized the company for "destroying more than $9 billion in stockholder value" for a "phenomenal franchise."[43] The letter called on e*Trade to explore a sale of the company. In 2013, Citadel sold its remaining share in e*Trade.[44]
Market advocacy[edit]
Citadel has played an active role in market structure issues and has advocated for financial legislation.
In 1999, Congress repealed a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that strictly separated banking and trading activities by financial firms. Griffin called dismantling that law "one of the biggest fiascos of all time."[45]
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Griffin and Citadel called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, a stance at odds with many other hedge funds and major financial firms. The company spoke out against Wall Street for lobbying to delay the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.[45][46]
Griffin has also called for breaking up "too big to fail" banks and separating their banking and trading activities.[46]
Following the 2014 publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, who claimed financial markets are "rigged" by high-frequency traders at the expense of smaller investors, Griffin became a high-profile defender of today's markets, pushing for the transformation from a dealer-dominated model to one that is more transparent, automated, and competitive. Griffin claimed U.S. equity markets are the "fairest, most transparent, resilient and competitive" in the world before the Senate Banking Committee.[47]
As a part of a series called Citadel Conversations, Stephen Berger spoke out advocating for "fair, open, and transparent markets."[48]
Offices[edit]
Citadel employs more than 1,250 individuals globally with its flagship operation located in the Citadel Center, a $355 million office tower in the heart of downtown Chicago.[49][50] The 37-story Citadel Center office tower opened in 2003 with Citadel as its anchor tenant.[51]
Citadel also has offices in New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, London, Houston, Greenwich, Denver, Shenzen, Shanghai, and Toronto.[52]
Philanthropy[edit]
Citadel is an active participant in the community by providing educational opportunities and helping children and families with acute medical needs.
The firm also partners with food banks around the United States for a "virtual food drive." In 2015, Citadel's contributions to the Greater Chicago Food Depository were the highest from a single corporate donor in that organization's history.[53]
Citadel leads a business plan competition for the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, mentoring low income high school students. In January 2015, Citadel partnered with the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) to tutor, prepare and support math and science students from low income communities.[54]
Recognition[edit]
Citadel has been acknowledged through various awards and accolades.
In 2015, Citadel received a "People's Pick" award as one of the 20 Great Places to Work in Financial Services.[55] The firm also ranked among the top 10 companies to work for according to employee surveys by Great Places to Work in 2015.
In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Citadel an A grade and the #3 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[56]
In 2013, Citadel was named the best overall hedge fund group in the Hedge Funds Reviews Americas Award.[57] Institutional Investor named Citadel Multistrategy Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2013 and 2014 and Institutional Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2015.[39]

Business segments[edit]
Citadel[edit]
As of January 2016, Citadel manages more than $25 billion in capital and is one of the world's largest asset managers.[1][6] Citadel ranks as the eleventh largest hedge fund manager in the world,[7] and the second largest multi-strategy hedge fund globally.[5] Citadel's group of hedge funds rank among the largest and most successful hedge funds in the world.[8] The hedge fund's assets under management has increased by 29% and more than $10 billion since 2014.[9]
Citadel manages funds across five different investment strategies including equities, commodities, fixed income, quantitative strategies, and credit. Luis Ortiz , Head of Repographics, greatly contributes to the team.[10] The firm is known for its state-of-the-art technology, fundamental research, and strong risk management culture.[11][12]
In 2011, the funds capped off two years of solid returns from 2009 and 2010 by crossing their high-water marks with gains of more than 20 percent, outperforming the industry average of 5 percent losses.[2][13] The firm's Kensington and Wellington funds posted returns of about 25 percent in 2012, completing their recovery from the financial crisis.[14]
In 2014, Citadel became the first foreign hedge fund to complete a yuan fundraising as part of a program to allow Chinese investors to invest in overseas hedge funds.[13]
Citadel Securities[edit]
Citadel Securities was formed in 2002, and is a leading market maker, providing liquidity and trade execution to retail and institutional clients. Citadel Securities automation has resulted in more reliable trading at lower costs and with tighter spreads.[2] Barron's recently ranked Citadel Securities #1 in providing price improvement for investors in both S&P 500 and non-S&P shares.[13]
Citadel Securities makes markets in more than 7,000 U.S.-listed securities and in about 18,000 OTC securities worldwide.[15] Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in options in the U.S., executing about 25 percent U.S.-listed equity options volume.[16] According to the Wall Street Journal, about one-third of stock orders from individual investors is completed through Citadel, which accounts for about 10% of the firm's revenue.[9]
Citadel Securities also executes about 13 percent of U.S. consolidated volume in equities and 28 percent of U.S. retail equities volume.[17][18]
In 2014, Citadel Securities expanded its market-making offering to interest-rate swaps, one of the most commonly-traded derivatives.[19] According to a report in the March 2015 edition of Risk Magazine, Citadel provides quotes to traders in an average time of 0.35 seconds, compared to 2.05 seconds for the next closest market maker.[20] The move into derivatives trading aligns with mandatory clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, a provision intended to prevent a future Lehman Brothers-style collapse.[21]
Citadel Securities retail trading platform is headed by Jamil Nazarali, who was named to the 2014 Trading Technology 40 by Institutional Investor.[22]
In July 2016, Citadel hired Microsoft COO and former Wal-Mart executive, B. Kevin Turner, to be the CEO of Citadel Securities.[23]
In January 2017, Turner left Citadel and was replaced by the vice chairman of the whole firm, Peng Zhao.[24]
Citadel Technology[edit]
Citadel Technology, established in 2009, is the wholly owned and independently operated affiliate of Citadel.[25][26] It offers investment management technology, developed internally at Citadel, to a wide range of firms and funds.[27]
In 2013, Citadel Technology announced a partnership with REDI. The partnership combines Citadel's order management system (OMS) with REDI's execution management capabilities (EMS).[25]
History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ken Griffin launched his trading career out of his dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, with $265,000 raised from friends and family.[28][29] As a sophomore, he traded convertible bonds and hooked a satellite dish to the roof of his dormitory.[29][30] After graduating with a degree in economics, Griffin joined Chicago-based hedge fund Glenwood Partners, led by hedge fund pioneer and Griffin mentor, Frank Meyer.[29] In November 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with Meyer's backing.[29][31]
Early history[edit]
According to a New York Times report, Citadel was started with $4.6 million in capital.[32] Citadel was originally named Wellington Financial Group after its flagship fund.[33] The company name was changed to Citadel in 1994.[33] Within eight years, the firm had more than $2 billion in assets.[34]
In 1998, Citadel started requiring investors to accept terms that "restrict[ed] their ability to withdraw their capital," according to Institutional Investor.[34] When fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed later that year, Citadel's capital lockdown made it "a rare buyer, as desperate hedge funds unloaded bond inventory."[34]
The 2008 financial crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, the firm's Kensington and Wellington Funds lost 55 percent of their value by the end of the year.[35] Griffin said, "we were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a week, if not more. CNBC parked a van in front of Citadel, waiting to break the story of our demise."[36]
Citadel suspended shareholder redemptions, which Griffin called one of the "most difficult decisions" in Citadel history.[37] Griffin later conceded that the firm was "overly confident" it could "weather any financial storm." He covered all investor management expenses during that period.[37]
On January 17, 2012, Citadel's flagship funds crossed their respective high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, "We did exactly what we said we would do, and we did it the right way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment."[37]
Risk management[edit]
Citadel's investing approach changed following the 2008 financial crisis. According to Risk Magazine, the foundation of Citadel's success is in large part a result of the risk management ethos.[11] The firm's risk management philosophy is focused on three main areas: risk capital allocation, stress exposure and liquidity management.[38] Citadel's risk management center has 36 monitors displaying more than 50,000 instruments being traded within the firm's portfolios.[38] It is "a real-time view of Citadel’s risk exposures across its investments and market making operations globally."[11] The firm runs 500 stress tests each day to simulate the impact of potential economic and geopolitical crises or other market dislocation.[38] Citadel aggregates investment positions on trading screens to calculate "more than 500 doomsday scenarios" to assess the potential of risk for the firm.[9]
In 2014, Citadel rated an A grade for risk management in the annual Institutional Investor Hedge Fund Report Card.[39] In April 2015, Ben S. Bernanke, who was the United States Federal Reserve chairman for eight years, joined Citadel as a senior adviser on global economic and financial issues.[40]
Major investments[edit]
Citadel is known for its many notable investments over the years.
In 2006, the company acquired large portions of Amaranth Advisors' energy portfolio. In 2007, Citadel purchased the entire portfolio of rival hedge fund Sowood Asset Management over the course of a weekend negotiation. Sowood had lost hundreds of millions of dollars and had to liquidate their portfolio to meet margin calls prior to the opening of the market on Monday.[41]
In November 2007, Citadel provided a $2.5 billion cash infusion to e*Trade Financial, taking a nearly 20 percent stake in the online broker that was ensnared in the home mortgage crisis.[42] In a 2011 letter to the e*Trade board, Citadel criticized the company for "destroying more than $9 billion in stockholder value" for a "phenomenal franchise."[43] The letter called on e*Trade to explore a sale of the company. In 2013, Citadel sold its remaining share in e*Trade.[44]
Market advocacy[edit]
Citadel has played an active role in market structure issues and has advocated for financial legislation.
In 1999, Congress repealed a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that strictly separated banking and trading activities by financial firms. Griffin called dismantling that law "one of the biggest fiascos of all time."[45]
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Griffin and Citadel called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, a stance at odds with many other hedge funds and major financial firms. The company spoke out against Wall Street for lobbying to delay the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.[45][46]
Griffin has also called for breaking up "too big to fail" banks and separating their banking and trading activities.[46]
Following the 2014 publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, who claimed financial markets are "rigged" by high-frequency traders at the expense of smaller investors, Griffin became a high-profile defender of today's markets, pushing for the transformation from a dealer-dominated model to one that is more transparent, automated, and competitive. Griffin claimed U.S. equity markets are the "fairest, most transparent, resilient and competitive" in the world before the Senate Banking Committee.[47]
As a part of a series called Citadel Conversations, Stephen Berger spoke out advocating for "fair, open, and transparent markets."[48]
Offices[edit]
Citadel employs more than 1,250 individuals globally with its flagship operation located in the Citadel Center, a $355 million office tower in the heart of downtown Chicago.[49][50] The 37-story Citadel Center office tower opened in 2003 with Citadel as its anchor tenant.[51]
Citadel also has offices in New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, London, Houston, Greenwich, Denver, Shenzen, Shanghai, and Toronto.[52]
Philanthropy[edit]
Citadel is an active participant in the community by providing educational opportunities and helping children and families with acute medical needs.
The firm also partners with food banks around the United States for a "virtual food drive." In 2015, Citadel's contributions to the Greater Chicago Food Depository were the highest from a single corporate donor in that organization's history.[53]
Citadel leads a business plan competition for the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, mentoring low income high school students. In January 2015, Citadel partnered with the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) to tutor, prepare and support math and science students from low income communities.[54]
Recognition[edit]
Citadel has been acknowledged through various awards and accolades.
In 2015, Citadel received a "People's Pick" award as one of the 20 Great Places to Work in Financial Services.[55] The firm also ranked among the top 10 companies to work for according to employee surveys by Great Places to Work in 2015.
In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Citadel an A grade and the #3 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[56]
In 2013, Citadel was named the best overall hedge fund group in the Hedge Funds Reviews Americas Award.[57] Institutional Investor named Citadel Multistrategy Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2013 and 2014 and Institutional Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2015.[39]

Business segments[edit]
Citadel[edit]
As of January 2016, Citadel manages more than $25 billion in capital and is one of the world's largest asset managers.[1][6] Citadel ranks as the eleventh largest hedge fund manager in the world,[7] and the second largest multi-strategy hedge fund globally.[5] Citadel's group of hedge funds rank among the largest and most successful hedge funds in the world.[8] The hedge fund's assets under management has increased by 29% and more than $10 billion since 2014.[9]
Citadel manages funds across five different investment strategies including equities, commodities, fixed income, quantitative strategies, and credit. Luis Ortiz , Head of Repographics, greatly contributes to the team.[10] The firm is known for its state-of-the-art technology, fundamental research, and strong risk management culture.[11][12]
In 2011, the funds capped off two years of solid returns from 2009 and 2010 by crossing their high-water marks with gains of more than 20 percent, outperforming the industry average of 5 percent losses.[2][13] The firm's Kensington and Wellington funds posted returns of about 25 percent in 2012, completing their recovery from the financial crisis.[14]
In 2014, Citadel became the first foreign hedge fund to complete a yuan fundraising as part of a program to allow Chinese investors to invest in overseas hedge funds.[13]
Citadel Securities[edit]
Citadel Securities was formed in 2002, and is a leading market maker, providing liquidity and trade execution to retail and institutional clients. Citadel Securities automation has resulted in more reliable trading at lower costs and with tighter spreads.[2] Barron's recently ranked Citadel Securities #1 in providing price improvement for investors in both S&P 500 and non-S&P shares.[13]
Citadel Securities makes markets in more than 7,000 U.S.-listed securities and in about 18,000 OTC securities worldwide.[15] Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in options in the U.S., executing about 25 percent U.S.-listed equity options volume.[16] According to the Wall Street Journal, about one-third of stock orders from individual investors is completed through Citadel, which accounts for about 10% of the firm's revenue.[9]
Citadel Securities also executes about 13 percent of U.S. consolidated volume in equities and 28 percent of U.S. retail equities volume.[17][18]
In 2014, Citadel Securities expanded its market-making offering to interest-rate swaps, one of the most commonly-traded derivatives.[19] According to a report in the March 2015 edition of Risk Magazine, Citadel provides quotes to traders in an average time of 0.35 seconds, compared to 2.05 seconds for the next closest market maker.[20] The move into derivatives trading aligns with mandatory clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, a provision intended to prevent a future Lehman Brothers-style collapse.[21]
Citadel Securities retail trading platform is headed by Jamil Nazarali, who was named to the 2014 Trading Technology 40 by Institutional Investor.[22]
In July 2016, Citadel hired Microsoft COO and former Wal-Mart executive, B. Kevin Turner, to be the CEO of Citadel Securities.[23]
In January 2017, Turner left Citadel and was replaced by the vice chairman of the whole firm, Peng Zhao.[24]
Citadel Technology[edit]
Citadel Technology, established in 2009, is the wholly owned and independently operated affiliate of Citadel.[25][26] It offers investment management technology, developed internally at Citadel, to a wide range of firms and funds.[27]
In 2013, Citadel Technology announced a partnership with REDI. The partnership combines Citadel's order management system (OMS) with REDI's execution management capabilities (EMS).[25]
History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ken Griffin launched his trading career out of his dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, with $265,000 raised from friends and family.[28][29] As a sophomore, he traded convertible bonds and hooked a satellite dish to the roof of his dormitory.[29][30] After graduating with a degree in economics, Griffin joined Chicago-based hedge fund Glenwood Partners, led by hedge fund pioneer and Griffin mentor, Frank Meyer.[29] In November 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with Meyer's backing.[29][31]
Early history[edit]
According to a New York Times report, Citadel was started with $4.6 million in capital.[32] Citadel was originally named Wellington Financial Group after its flagship fund.[33] The company name was changed to Citadel in 1994.[33] Within eight years, the firm had more than $2 billion in assets.[34]
In 1998, Citadel started requiring investors to accept terms that "restrict[ed] their ability to withdraw their capital," according to Institutional Investor.[34] When fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed later that year, Citadel's capital lockdown made it "a rare buyer, as desperate hedge funds unloaded bond inventory."[34]
The 2008 financial crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, the firm's Kensington and Wellington Funds lost 55 percent of their value by the end of the year.[35] Griffin said, "we were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a week, if not more. CNBC parked a van in front of Citadel, waiting to break the story of our demise."[36]
Citadel suspended shareholder redemptions, which Griffin called one of the "most difficult decisions" in Citadel history.[37] Griffin later conceded that the firm was "overly confident" it could "weather any financial storm." He covered all investor management expenses during that period.[37]
On January 17, 2012, Citadel's flagship funds crossed their respective high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, "We did exactly what we said we would do, and we did it the right way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment."[37]
Risk management[edit]
Citadel's investing approach changed following the 2008 financial crisis. According to Risk Magazine, the foundation of Citadel's success is in large part a result of the risk management ethos.[11] The firm's risk management philosophy is focused on three main areas: risk capital allocation, stress exposure and liquidity management.[38] Citadel's risk management center has 36 monitors displaying more than 50,000 instruments being traded within the firm's portfolios.[38] It is "a real-time view of Citadel’s risk exposures across its investments and market making operations globally."[11] The firm runs 500 stress tests each day to simulate the impact of potential economic and geopolitical crises or other market dislocation.[38] Citadel aggregates investment positions on trading screens to calculate "more than 500 doomsday scenarios" to assess the potential of risk for the firm.[9]
In 2014, Citadel rated an A grade for risk management in the annual Institutional Investor Hedge Fund Report Card.[39] In April 2015, Ben S. Bernanke, who was the United States Federal Reserve chairman for eight years, joined Citadel as a senior adviser on global economic and financial issues.[40]
Major investments[edit]
Citadel is known for its many notable investments over the years.
In 2006, the company acquired large portions of Amaranth Advisors' energy portfolio. In 2007, Citadel purchased the entire portfolio of rival hedge fund Sowood Asset Management over the course of a weekend negotiation. Sowood had lost hundreds of millions of dollars and had to liquidate their portfolio to meet margin calls prior to the opening of the market on Monday.[41]
In November 2007, Citadel provided a $2.5 billion cash infusion to e*Trade Financial, taking a nearly 20 percent stake in the online broker that was ensnared in the home mortgage crisis.[42] In a 2011 letter to the e*Trade board, Citadel criticized the company for "destroying more than $9 billion in stockholder value" for a "phenomenal franchise."[43] The letter called on e*Trade to explore a sale of the company. In 2013, Citadel sold its remaining share in e*Trade.[44]
Market advocacy[edit]
Citadel has played an active role in market structure issues and has advocated for financial legislation.
In 1999, Congress repealed a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that strictly separated banking and trading activities by financial firms. Griffin called dismantling that law "one of the biggest fiascos of all time."[45]
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Griffin and Citadel called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, a stance at odds with many other hedge funds and major financial firms. The company spoke out against Wall Street for lobbying to delay the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.[45][46]
Griffin has also called for breaking up "too big to fail" banks and separating their banking and trading activities.[46]
Following the 2014 publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, who claimed financial markets are "rigged" by high-frequency traders at the expense of smaller investors, Griffin became a high-profile defender of today's markets, pushing for the transformation from a dealer-dominated model to one that is more transparent, automated, and competitive. Griffin claimed U.S. equity markets are the "fairest, most transparent, resilient and competitive" in the world before the Senate Banking Committee.[47]
As a part of a series called Citadel Conversations, Stephen Berger spoke out advocating for "fair, open, and transparent markets."[48]
Offices[edit]
Citadel employs more than 1,250 individuals globally with its flagship operation located in the Citadel Center, a $355 million office tower in the heart of downtown Chicago.[49][50] The 37-story Citadel Center office tower opened in 2003 with Citadel as its anchor tenant.[51]
Citadel also has offices in New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, London, Houston, Greenwich, Denver, Shenzen, Shanghai, and Toronto.[52]
Philanthropy[edit]
Citadel is an active participant in the community by providing educational opportunities and helping children and families with acute medical needs.
The firm also partners with food banks around the United States for a "virtual food drive." In 2015, Citadel's contributions to the Greater Chicago Food Depository were the highest from a single corporate donor in that organization's history.[53]
Citadel leads a business plan competition for the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, mentoring low income high school students. In January 2015, Citadel partnered with the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) to tutor, prepare and support math and science students from low income communities.[54]
Recognition[edit]
Citadel has been acknowledged through various awards and accolades.
In 2015, Citadel received a "People's Pick" award as one of the 20 Great Places to Work in Financial Services.[55] The firm also ranked among the top 10 companies to work for according to employee surveys by Great Places to Work in 2015.
In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Citadel an A grade and the #3 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[56]
In 2013, Citadel was named the best overall hedge fund group in the Hedge Funds Reviews Americas Award.[57] Institutional Investor named Citadel Multistrategy Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2013 and 2014 and Institutional Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2015.[39]

In July 2016, Citadel hired Microsoft COO and former Wal-Mart executive, B. Kevin Turner, to be the CEO of Citadel Securities.[23]
In January 2017, Turner left Citadel and was replaced by the vice chairman of the whole firm, Peng Zhao.[24]
Citadel Technology[edit]
Citadel Technology, established in 2009, is the wholly owned and independently operated affiliate of Citadel.[25][26] It offers investment management technology, developed internally at Citadel, to a wide range of firms and funds.[27]
In 2013, Citadel Technology announced a partnership with REDI. The partnership combines Citadel's order management system (OMS) with REDI's execution management capabilities (EMS).[25]
History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ken Griffin launched his trading career out of his dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, with $265,000 raised from friends and family.[28][29] As a sophomore, he traded convertible bonds and hooked a satellite dish to the roof of his dormitory.[29][30] After graduating with a degree in economics, Griffin joined Chicago-based hedge fund Glenwood Partners, led by hedge fund pioneer and Griffin mentor, Frank Meyer.[29] In November 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with Meyer's backing.[29][31]
Early history[edit]
According to a New York Times report, Citadel was started with $4.6 million in capital.[32] Citadel was originally named Wellington Financial Group after its flagship fund.[33] The company name was changed to Citadel in 1994.[33] Within eight years, the firm had more than $2 billion in assets.[34]
In 1998, Citadel started requiring investors to accept terms that "restrict[ed] their ability to withdraw their capital," according to Institutional Investor.[34] When fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed later that year, Citadel's capital lockdown made it "a rare buyer, as desperate hedge funds unloaded bond inventory."[34]
The 2008 financial crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, the firm's Kensington and Wellington Funds lost 55 percent of their value by the end of the year.[35] Griffin said, "we were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a week, if not more. CNBC parked a van in front of Citadel, waiting to break the story of our demise."[36]
Citadel suspended shareholder redemptions, which Griffin called one of the "most difficult decisions" in Citadel history.[37] Griffin later conceded that the firm was "overly confident" it could "weather any financial storm." He covered all investor management expenses during that period.[37]
On January 17, 2012, Citadel's flagship funds crossed their respective high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, "We did exactly what we said we would do, and we did it the right way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment."[37]
Risk management[edit]
Citadel's investing approach changed following the 2008 financial crisis. According to Risk Magazine, the foundation of Citadel's success is in large part a result of the risk management ethos.[11] The firm's risk management philosophy is focused on three main areas: risk capital allocation, stress exposure and liquidity management.[38] Citadel's risk management center has 36 monitors displaying more than 50,000 instruments being traded within the firm's portfolios.[38] It is "a real-time view of Citadel’s risk exposures across its investments and market making operations globally."[11] The firm runs 500 stress tests each day to simulate the impact of potential economic and geopolitical crises or other market dislocation.[38] Citadel aggregates investment positions on trading screens to calculate "more than 500 doomsday scenarios" to assess the potential of risk for the firm.[9]
In 2014, Citadel rated an A grade for risk management in the annual Institutional Investor Hedge Fund Report Card.[39] In April 2015, Ben S. Bernanke, who was the United States Federal Reserve chairman for eight years, joined Citadel as a senior adviser on global economic and financial issues.[40]
Major investments[edit]
Citadel is known for its many notable investments over the years.
In 2006, the company acquired large portions of Amaranth Advisors' energy portfolio. In 2007, Citadel purchased the entire portfolio of rival hedge fund Sowood Asset Management over the course of a weekend negotiation. Sowood had lost hundreds of millions of dollars and had to liquidate their portfolio to meet margin calls prior to the opening of the market on Monday.[41]
In November 2007, Citadel provided a $2.5 billion cash infusion to e*Trade Financial, taking a nearly 20 percent stake in the online broker that was ensnared in the home mortgage crisis.[42] In a 2011 letter to the e*Trade board, Citadel criticized the company for "destroying more than $9 billion in stockholder value" for a "phenomenal franchise."[43] The letter called on e*Trade to explore a sale of the company. In 2013, Citadel sold its remaining share in e*Trade.[44]
Market advocacy[edit]
Citadel has played an active role in market structure issues and has advocated for financial legislation.
In 1999, Congress repealed a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that strictly separated banking and trading activities by financial firms. Griffin called dismantling that law "one of the biggest fiascos of all time."[45]
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Griffin and Citadel called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, a stance at odds with many other hedge funds and major financial firms. The company spoke out against Wall Street for lobbying to delay the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.[45][46]
Griffin has also called for breaking up "too big to fail" banks and separating their banking and trading activities.[46]
Following the 2014 publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, who claimed financial markets are "rigged" by high-frequency traders at the expense of smaller investors, Griffin became a high-profile defender of today's markets, pushing for the transformation from a dealer-dominated model to one that is more transparent, automated, and competitive. Griffin claimed U.S. equity markets are the "fairest, most transparent, resilient and competitive" in the world before the Senate Banking Committee.[47]
As a part of a series called Citadel Conversations, Stephen Berger spoke out advocating for "fair, open, and transparent markets."[48]
Offices[edit]
Citadel employs more than 1,250 individuals globally with its flagship operation located in the Citadel Center, a $355 million office tower in the heart of downtown Chicago.[49][50] The 37-story Citadel Center office tower opened in 2003 with Citadel as its anchor tenant.[51]
Citadel also has offices in New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, London, Houston, Greenwich, Denver, Shenzen, Shanghai, and Toronto.[52]
Philanthropy[edit]
Citadel is an active participant in the community by providing educational opportunities and helping children and families with acute medical needs.
The firm also partners with food banks around the United States for a "virtual food drive." In 2015, Citadel's contributions to the Greater Chicago Food Depository were the highest from a single corporate donor in that organization's history.[53]
Citadel leads a business plan competition for the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, mentoring low income high school students. In January 2015, Citadel partnered with the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) to tutor, prepare and support math and science students from low income communities.[54]
Recognition[edit]
Citadel has been acknowledged through various awards and accolades.
In 2015, Citadel received a "People's Pick" award as one of the 20 Great Places to Work in Financial Services.[55] The firm also ranked among the top 10 companies to work for according to employee surveys by Great Places to Work in 2015.
In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Citadel an A grade and the #3 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[56]
In 2013, Citadel was named the best overall hedge fund group in the Hedge Funds Reviews Americas Award.[57] Institutional Investor named Citadel Multistrategy Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2013 and 2014 and Institutional Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2015.[39]

Founding[edit]
Ken Griffin launched his trading career out of his dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, with $265,000 raised from friends and family.[28][29] As a sophomore, he traded convertible bonds and hooked a satellite dish to the roof of his dormitory.[29][30] After graduating with a degree in economics, Griffin joined Chicago-based hedge fund Glenwood Partners, led by hedge fund pioneer and Griffin mentor, Frank Meyer.[29] In November 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with Meyer's backing.[29][31]

The 2008 financial crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, the firm's Kensington and Wellington Funds lost 55 percent of their value by the end of the year.[35] Griffin said, "we were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a week, if not more. CNBC parked a van in front of Citadel, waiting to break the story of our demise."[36]
Citadel suspended shareholder redemptions, which Griffin called one of the "most difficult decisions" in Citadel history.[37] Griffin later conceded that the firm was "overly confident" it could "weather any financial storm." He covered all investor management expenses during that period.[37]
On January 17, 2012, Citadel's flagship funds crossed their respective high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, "We did exactly what we said we would do, and we did it the right way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment."[37]

Citadel's investing approach changed following the 2008 financial crisis. According to Risk Magazine, the foundation of Citadel's success is in large part a result of the risk management ethos.[11] The firm's risk management philosophy is focused on three main areas: risk capital allocation, stress exposure and liquidity management.[38] Citadel's risk management center has 36 monitors displaying more than 50,000 instruments being traded within the firm's portfolios.[38] It is "a real-time view of Citadel’s risk exposures across its investments and market making operations globally."[11] The firm runs 500 stress tests each day to simulate the impact of potential economic and geopolitical crises or other market dislocation.[38] Citadel aggregates investment positions on trading screens to calculate "more than 500 doomsday scenarios" to assess the potential of risk for the firm.[9]
In 2014, Citadel rated an A grade for risk management in the annual Institutional Investor Hedge Fund Report Card.[39] In April 2015, Ben S. Bernanke, who was the United States Federal Reserve chairman for eight years, joined Citadel as a senior adviser on global economic and financial issues.[40]

Citadel is known for its many notable investments over the years.
In 2006, the company acquired large portions of Amaranth Advisors' energy portfolio. In 2007, Citadel purchased the entire portfolio of rival hedge fund Sowood Asset Management over the course of a weekend negotiation. Sowood had lost hundreds of millions of dollars and had to liquidate their portfolio to meet margin calls prior to the opening of the market on Monday.[41]
In November 2007, Citadel provided a $2.5 billion cash infusion to e*Trade Financial, taking a nearly 20 percent stake in the online broker that was ensnared in the home mortgage crisis.[42] In a 2011 letter to the e*Trade board, Citadel criticized the company for "destroying more than $9 billion in stockholder value" for a "phenomenal franchise."[43] The letter called on e*Trade to explore a sale of the company. In 2013, Citadel sold its remaining share in e*Trade.[44]
Market advocacy[edit]
Citadel has played an active role in market structure issues and has advocated for financial legislation.
In 1999, Congress repealed a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that strictly separated banking and trading activities by financial firms. Griffin called dismantling that law "one of the biggest fiascos of all time."[45]

Griffin claimed U.S. equity markets are the "fairest, most transparent, resilient and competitive" in the world before the Senate Banking Committee.[47]
As a part of a series called Citadel Conversations, Stephen Berger spoke out advocating for "fair, open, and transparent markets."[48]
Offices[edit]
Citadel employs more than 1,250 individuals globally with its flagship operation located in the Citadel Center, a $355 million office tower in the heart of downtown Chicago.[49][50] The 37-story Citadel Center office tower opened in 2003 with Citadel as its anchor tenant.[51]
Citadel also has offices in New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, London, Houston, Greenwich, Denver, Shenzen, Shanghai, and Toronto.[52]
Philanthropy[edit]
Citadel is an active participant in the community by providing educational opportunities and helping children and families with acute medical needs.
The firm also partners with food banks around the United States for a "virtual food drive." In 2015, Citadel's contributions to the Greater Chicago Food Depository were the highest from a single corporate donor in that organization's history.[53]
Citadel leads a business plan competition for the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, mentoring low income high school students. In January 2015, Citadel partnered with the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) to tutor, prepare and support math and science students from low income communities.[54]
Recognition[edit]
Citadel has been acknowledged through various awards and accolades.
In 2015, Citadel received a "People's Pick" award as one of the 20 Great Places to Work in Financial Services.[55] The firm also ranked among the top 10 companies to work for according to employee surveys by Great Places to Work in 2015.
In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Citadel an A grade and the #3 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[56]
In 2013, Citadel was named the best overall hedge fund group in the Hedge Funds Reviews Americas Award.[57] Institutional Investor named Citadel Multistrategy Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2013 and 2014 and Institutional Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2015.[39]

  Capital Campaign
An Unprecedented Gift for Undergraduate Financial Aid
2.19.14





Kenneth C. Griffin
Photograph by Paul Elledge










 


Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, founder and chief executive officer of the Citadel LLC, a multibillion-dollar, Chicago-based hedge-fund and financial-services enterprise, has given Harvard $150 million, principally for undergraduate financial aid, the University announced today.“Ken Griffin’s extraordinary philanthropy is opening Harvard’s gates wider to the most talented students in the world, no matter their economic circumstances,” said Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust in acknowledging the gift, the largest in Harvard College history. Griffin himself called itextremely important that students of all backgrounds have the opportunity to challenge themselves, learn to solve complex problems, and ultimately better our world. My goal with this gift is to help ensure that Harvard’s need-blind admission policy continues, and that our nation’s best and brightest have continued access to this outstanding institution.Specifically, the gift:establishes 200 Griffin Scholarships  (such financial-aid endowment scholarships are now available for donations of $250,000 each; that minimum is to rise to $500,000 in the fiscal year beginning July 1), andprovides matching funds through the new Griffin Leadership Challenge Fund for Financial Aid for 600 new scholarships to encourage other donors to make commitments to the College’s financial-aid program.Depending on the matching formula and timing of gifts, the Griffin Scholarships, other donors’ gifts (when received), and the matching funds provided by Griffin could collectively generate a significant portion of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ (FAS) $600-million capital-campaign goal for undergraduate aid. (The only equivalently large FAS priority is its $600-million faculty-related target for endowed chairs, graduate-student fellowships, research support, and related purposes.) In acknowledgment, the College financial-aid office will be renamed the Griffin Financial Aid Office, led by the Griffin Director of Financial Aid.Griffin’s gift also includes $10 million to establish the Griffin professorship of business administration at Harvard Business School (from which his wife, Anne Dias Griffin, who runs a separate hedge fund, earned her M.B.A. in 1997). The new professorship, said President Faust, “reflects our shared belief in the importance of attracting both world-class students and unparalleled faculty in each of our Schools.”The Undergraduate Financial-Aid ContextFAS dean Michael D. Smith declared himself “absolutely bowled over by the generosity of Ken Griffin and his leadership to provide a truly transformational gift” for the top College priority in the capital campaign. During an interview last autumn, before the campaign launch, he said the aid budget had “never been put on the table” in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis—even as the faculty’s assets decreased by $5 billion and family need rose during the ensuing recession. But, as he said in a recent interview concerning Griffin’s gift, he has worried continuously about “truly making our program sustainable,” even at its current scale. In the statement announcing the gift, Smith declared that Griffin’s philanthropic leadership “has set financial aid…on a lasting foundation,” and his gift “will impact the lives of students and their families, now and for generations to come.”Three intersecting factors explain why that is so.Enhanced aid. This is the tenth anniversary of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI), announced in February 2004 by then-president Lawrence H. Summers, the beginning of a liberalized aid program (progressively expanded in subsequent years). The initiative eliminated parental contributions to the cost of educating a student enrolled in the College for families with incomes below $40,000, and lowered the cost for families with incomes up to $60,000. The zero-contribution threshold was raised to $60,000 in 2006, with the cost-reduced tier raised to $80,000. In late 2007, President Drew Faust upped the ante by:eliminating loans (so students could graduate debt-free, enabling them to make less-constrained career choices);cutting the parental contribution for families with incomes from $60,000 to $120,000 by limiting their cost for a child’s year at Harvard to an amount that scales up from zero to 10 percent of income;limiting the cost to 10 percent of income for families with incomes from $120,000 to $180,000; andeliminating home equity and retirement savings in calculating aid.In retrospect, the timing of that considerable enrichment of aid was fateful: it came during a period of strong returns on the endowment (its value peaked at $36.9 billion as of June 30, 2008)—only to be succeeded, 10 months later by the financial-market collapse, the resulting $11-billion decline in the endowment, and ensuing budget cuts.






(As of the fall of 2012, effective for the class of 2016, the zero-contribution threshold was raised to $65,000 of family income, and the zero-to-10-percent sliding-scale formula was restructured, reducing the upper tier of eligible families to those with incomes of $150,000 or less. As FAS’s spokesman explained at the time, “These adjustments help to meet heightened demand for aid precipitated by ongoing challenges in the United States and the global economies. Demand for aid is most acute at the lower end of the economic spectrum, and Harvard modified its policy and expanded its investment to respond to this need.” On those terms, the University recently reported that more than one-quarter of the College class of 2017, a record number, are HFAI beneficiaries: among freshmen enrolling last fall, 287 are from families who pay no parental contribution, and 144 from families paying a reduced parental contribution.)Rising need. Under the liberalized financial-aid formulas, the number of students qualifying for aid, and the size of their grants, rose. The recession put many more families’ incomes under great pressure. And of course the annual bill for tuition, room, and board increased annually—enlarging the size of the required aid package. For students entering the College in the fall of 2004, when HFAI began, the term bill was $39,880; this academic year, it is $56,407—a compound annual growth rate of about 4 percent.The resource squeeze. According to College data, Harvard’s budget for undergraduate financial aid has increased by 88 percent since 2007, and today, 60 percent of undergraduates receive financial aid. Given the increase in spending and the decrease in the value of the endowment (and two years of resulting reduced distributions for operating expenses, the faculty’s principal source of revenue), FAS found itself in a financially uncomfortable position as it had to fund the aid budget—never “put on the table,” in Smith’s words—by drawing more on its unrestricted funds.In fiscal year 2011, in fact, despite higher term bills, total (net) tuition and fees (after financial-aid disbursements) declined. Since tuition and fees typically represent half or more of all FAS’s unrestricted funds for the College, the graduate school, and the faculty, that obviously limited Smith’s ability to meet other costs at a time of acute financial pressure, and to invest in academic innovations, new professors’ research, and so on. (Net tuition and fees resumed growing in the two subsequent years.)“A lot of our unrestricted money is going to” undergraduate financial aid, Smith said. “I can't think of better programs for the money to go to than that,” given the benefit to students themselves—and to their classmates and the College as a whole from having highly qualified and more economically diverse undergraduate body. But, in annual budgeting, he said, the problem of funding the aid program, and of its future, inevitably has arisen. “We’ve struggled to make that budget every year,” he said. “That’s why it’s been such a high [campaign] priority for us.”According to FAS, approximately 50 percent of undergraduate financial aid is currently paid for by distributions from endowments earmarked for that purpose. Hence the priority given to College aid funds in the current campaign. Additional financial-aid endowment totaling $600 million would generate $30 million or more of spendable funds annually, in effect releasing an equivalent sum of unrestricted monies. (And, of course, the endowed corpus would be expected to appreciate over time, helping to defray any increased aid costs.)Thus the faculty-wide significance of Griffin’s scholarship gift and challenge fund.(To commemorate HFAI’s tenth anniversary—and perhaps in anticipation of this signal gift announcement—on February 7 the Harvard Gazette published this story on financial aid and some of its student beneficiaries.)The GiftBy itself, Griffin’s gift to the College may in fact be the largest single gift in Harvard history, period. It exceeds the two individual gifts of $125 million from Hansjörg Wyss, M.B.A. ’65, announced in 2008 and 2013, to support bioengineering research, and the $100-million gift made in 2008 by David Rockefeller, ’36, G ’37, LL.D. ’69, in support of undergraduate international experiences and the renovation of the Harvard Art Museum.Smith described Griffin as an “active” supporter of FAS and the College, especially for scholarships, beginning in his tenth-reunion year, when he established a scholarship to honor his grandfather Wayne R. Gratz. He has been a participant in the alumni financial-aid committee, and “he’s been part of this conversation for a long time.” Smith said he and Griffin had discussed the need for supporting aid throughout his deanship, exploring ways to “create a foundation for this program.”As their conversations focused on the scale and structure of the gift, Smith said, Griffin has “just been fantastic as a partner in this. I can’t thank him enough for setting an example I hope others will follow, not only for Harvard but for other institutions.”Griffin said that his gift comes from the belief that financial aid is a “key part” of making Harvard “available and open to all.” In a brief interview with Harvard Magazine, he recalled becoming directly involved with financial-aid concerns about 15 years ago, being “in the middle of that discussion to understand what are the issues that students face in trying to go to Harvard, what are the issues that families face in trying to put their children through Harvard.“Growing up, my parents were always very clear that they were fully committed to supporting me in going to school wherever I wanted. I don’t think they envisioned my going to Harvard and the price tag that would go with that….I was not on financial aid, but I can assure you that for my parents and for myself, the financial support of my grandmother was really important. Not everybody has that in life.”The DonorAmong the thousands of hedge-fund managers, a tiny cohort are particularly successful: able to generate large returns for their investors (and on their own invested assets) for a sustained period, in some outstanding years topping industry and popular lists with nine-figure earnings and appreciation in their personal portfolios. If they can sustain the performance, they find their way onto the Forbes and other lists of the wealthy.In these rarefied circles, Kenneth Griffin and Citadel stand out.First, he has been at this work, at the firm he founded, for virtually his entire career, rather than coming to it after an extended tour on Wall Street or at another firm. He began trading as an undergraduate, as The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Institutional Investor (in a December 2009 profile) have all reported. A year after graduating from the College (a year early, in 1989, with an economics concentration), he launched Citadel with $4.6 million under management. Over time, propelled by a decade of 20 percent returns in its flagship funds, Citadel reportedly grew to manage more than $20 billion at its peak, before the 2008 financial crisis.Second, to an unusual degree, Griffin has apparently combined opportunistic, instinctive investing with highly quantitative, automated, algorithm-driven techniques. Among Citadel’s opportunistic, contrarian moves, the Bloomberg and Institutional Investor accounts list the firm’s decisions to begin a kind of trading and investing that others abandoned in the wake of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, to enter energy trading after Enron’s bankruptcy in late 2001, and to make big bets on natural gas after another hedge fund lost billions in 2006.Third, Citadel has invested heavily in proprietary technology for its own investing strategies and trading operations, according to most accounts, and has regularly sought to find ways to bring functions in-house that other investors perform through Wall Street firms—and even to sell these services to other asset managers (as Institutional Investor reported). Most notably, in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, Griffin set about trying to build a full-size, full-service investment bank to fill the gap left by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the absorption by other firms of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. That effort was largely abandoned in 2011, and other ventures have come and gone as well. Nonetheless, Citadel Securities’ retail-execution services, by its own account, carry out nearly a quarter of retail investors’ U.S. listed-stock trades; it trades for institutional investors, as well, and is a large participant in automated, high-speed trading generally. The Citadel Technology operation similarly serves other investment-management clients.Fourth, Griffin and Citadel have survived a financial near-death experience. When the financial crisis intensified in October 2008, Citadel’s funds were, by most accounts, both heavily invested in severely affected market sectors, and very heavily leveraged. On October 24, Wall Street was riveted (The New York Times live-blogged the event) as Citadel’s chief operating officer, Gerald Beeson, and Griffin conducted a conference call to stave off rumors that the firm was imperiled; in fact, its two principal funds were then down 35 percent, and ended the year with losses of 55 percent, The New York Times reported. After limiting investors’ redemptions and improving performance (the firm’s diversified stable of investment funds and other businesses were again producing very strong results, with the flagship hedge funds realizing returns from as much as 62 percent in 2009 to between 11 percent and 25 percent in subsequent years), by early 2012, Citadel had restored the funds’ value sufficiently that it could again collect its substantial contractual management fees.In their personal lives, the Griffins have become notably active in two realms: as art collectors, reportedly assembling masterpieces ranging from works by Edgar Degas to Jasper Johns; and as philanthropists active particularly in their home city, Chicago. Among other engagements, Kenneth Griffin serves on the board of the Chicago Public Education Fund and as a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago and of the Museum of Contemporary Art. Anne Dias Griffin is a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.Their Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation has focused on education, medicine and medical research, and the arts. A notable gift in the latter area was $19 million of support to underwrite the central court of the Renzo Piano-designed modern wing of the Art Institute. The Griffin Court is a soaring space that unites the new wing’s two sides and provides central circulation for the reconfigured Institute as a whole. (Piano is also the architect for the renovation, expansion, and reconstruction of the Harvard Art Museums, incorporating the original Fogg structure, scheduled to reopen this autumn.)At its annual dinner in March 2010, the Harvard Club of Chicago recognized Anne and Kenneth Griffin with its yearly award for Chicagoans who have rendered extraordinary service to the community outside their professional fields. (The award is not restricted to alumni, and in fact frequently honors people who are not Harvard affiliates.)Now, with Citadel apparently on firmer footing than ever, Kenneth Griffin’s undergraduate financial-aid commitment is on a scale unprecedented in terms of his past philanthropic commitments—and for the College and University whose students he has determined to support.

Step aside, Steven A. Cohen, there is another billionaire hedge fund manager with a voracious appetite for historic, and expensive, art.Kenneth C. Griffin, the founder of the $26 billion investment firm Citadel, recently paid $500 million for “Number 17A,” a Jackson Pollock painting, and “Interchanged” by Willem de Kooning.He bought the art from the private collection of David Geffen, the entertainment mogul, and has lent it to the Art Institute of Chicago, where it is on display.“These two iconic paintings allow us to share wonderfully powerful and transformative moments in the history of postwar art with thousands of visitors to our museum every day,” James Rondeau, president of the Art Institute, said of the loan. Mr. Griffin is a trustee of the museum. Continue reading the main story

“Number 17A” was among three paintings featured in a 1949 Life magazine feature — “Jackson Pollock: Is He the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?” — that introduced a new form of modern art to many Americans.When “Interchanged” was displayed at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1956, one art critic said Mr. de Kooning had surpassed Pablo Picasso as the most influential painter.Like the great titans of industry during the Gilded Age, hedge fund managers have in recent decades spent their riches on art, adding famous contemporary and Old Master art pieces to their offices and homes.The Rockefeller Center offices of John Paulson are filled with Alexander Calder watercolors.Mr. Cohen’s collection includes art by Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Alberto Giacometti and Picasso — some of which he shares between his office and his Connecticut home.Other investors, like Daniel S. Loeb, have also shown off some of their most expensive art in their offices.

Mr. Griffin, however, has no famous artwork hanging on the walls of his office in Chicago, only photographs of and art by his own children. Still, the investor has become a prolific art collector in recent years, aided by the tremendous success of his hedge fund and the fees his investors pay.In 2014, Mr. Griffin made more money than any other hedge fund manager, bringing home $1.3 billion, according to Institutional Investor’s Alpha magazine.He and his former wife, Anne Dias, made a name for themselves in 2007, when they began to lead ARTnews’ list of the top 200 art owners, joining the ranks of Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Henry R. Kravis of the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The Griffins’ collection of art has included “False Start” by Jasper Johns — which they bought from Mr. Geffen for $80 million — and artworks by Cézanne and Monet.Ms. Dias has been credited with helping to raise Mr. Griffin’s standing within the art world and she is a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art and a director of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts.

Mr. Griffin is also on the board of the Whitney, and the lobby of its new building in Manhattan has been named after him.Mr. Griffin and Ms. Dias reached a divorce settlement in October, putting an end to a domestic dispute between the once-private couple that had pushed them into the public eye.The couple also donated $19 million to the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Renzo Piano-designed art wing of the museum has been named the Griffin Court. In December, after their divorce, Mr. Griffin donated $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art — more than anyone else ever, earning him naming rights to the Johnson Wing of the museum.Outside the art world, Mr. Griffin is also a big spender on national and local politics. He backed Mitt Romney’s 2012 run for president, and emerged as the biggest supporter of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s re-election campaign in Chicago last year.Since Mr. Griffin began collecting art, he has built his firm from one that focused on the hedge fund business to a multibillion-dollar investment firm that not only manages money for investors but also places stock trades. Last year, Citadel’s flagship hedge fund had a 14 percent return.

This year, however, has been rocky so far. Citadel’s flagship fund is down 6.5 percent as of last Friday, according to a person briefed on the fund’s performance but not authorized to speak publicly.This week, Mr. Griffin fired more than a dozen employees in the Surveyor Capital unit at Citadel. The news, reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, prompted speculation that Citadel would shut down the trading unit.A spokeswoman from Citadel denied the firm had any plan to close down Surveyor, saying that the unit “has been very successful over time, and we have a great team in place to drive the business forward.”Citadel also recently signed a deal to rent 200,000 square feet in a new building at 425 Park Avenue in Manhattan.While his business may have gotten off to a slow start this year, Mr. Griffin’s art buying has been going at an extraordinary clip.A decade ago, Mr. Cohen spent some $300 million to amass a collection of works that included Jackson Pollock’s paintings, a Manet self-portrait and an Andy Warhol, among others.With one transaction, Mr. Griffin has now managed to surpass Mr. Cohen.

About 
                    Us

In 
                    1962, Jack and Bernie Knauss founded Terrell Equipment Company, 
                    Inc. The company was established in Terrell, Texas in an abandoned 
                    WWII army barrack out of which custom equipment and a line 
                    of square corner sinks were produced.

                    In 1968, Vernon Griffin joined the company. He became president 
                    in 1983 and co-owner in 1984. During his tenure, galvanized 
                    sink production ended and Terrell began production of a complete 
                    line of NSF approved stainless steel equipment.

                    Shane Griffin founded Express Equipment Fabricators, Inc. 
                    in 1994 in Seguin, Texas with the help of Janet Griffin, Amy 
                    Fritcher and Kenneth Fritcher. The name was changed in 1996 
                    to Griffin Products, Inc.; and the operations were moved to 
                    Wills Point, Texas in 1997. Vernon Griffin joined our company 
                    after closing Terrell in 1997.

                    Evidence of our experience in the industry is well represented 
                    in our products. Our square corner sinks are the same as their 
                    Terrell predecessors of 1962, and our coved corner sinks closely 
                    resemble those Terrell began producing in 1980. Although appearances 
                    are similar, much has changed in our production methods. Yet 
                    we continue to improve, not compromise our line of products, 
                    our quality and our services.

                    For those of you who knew him at Terrell, you will be happy 
                    to know that Jack Knauss still comes by from time to time 
                    to inspect our work.

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Kenneth C. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida.[10][11] In high school, he excelled academically while also being the president of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article.[12][13] During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother.[10] He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during the stock market crash of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1 million.[10][11] Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.[2]
Investment career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard, Frank C. Meyer, an investor and founder of Glenwood Capital LLC, provided Griffin with $1 million to invest.[14] Griffin exceeded Meyer's expectations and, according to The New York Times, Meyer made 70 percent return on the investment.[15]
Citadel[edit]
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with $4.6 million.[16][17] By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital.[17]
In June 2002, Griffin was included in CFO Magazine's Global 100, a list of the most influential people in the world of finance.[18]
Griffin has appeared numerous times in Forbes' Forbes 400, first in 2003, with an estimated net worth of $650 million. At 34, he was the youngest self-made individual on the list.[19] In September 2004, Fortune magazine ranked Griffin, who was 35 that year, as the eighth richest American under forty in the category of self-made, United States-based wealth.[20] In 2006, Griffin was the fifth youngest of the seven members under the age of 40 listed on the Forbes 400.[21][22] In 2007, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $3 billion.[23] By 2014, Griffin’s net worth was estimated at $5.5 billion.[24]
In March 2015, Citadel received a Top 10 Great Workplaces in Financial Services ranking by the Great Places to Work Institute, based on a survey by Citadel employees. Griffin was credited for implementing a collaborative work culture and providing perks to employees including free lunch, museum tours, fitness programs and personal gifts.[4][25]
Griffin was a featured panelist at the 2015 Milken Institute Global Conference where he spoke about Citadel, building complex organizations by investing in employees,[26][27] and corporate activism in which he said: "I’m all in favor of liberating access to the boardroom by activists and giving shareholders a greater role in how [the company is] managed. That benefit accrues to everyone in society."[28][importance?]
Political and economic views[edit]
Griffin serves on the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.[29] Griffin is also a member of the G100, a network of 100 CEOs that meets periodically to discuss the global economy.[30][31][32] In 2012, Griffin said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune that he was a Reagan Republican. He said, "This belief that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good: is wrong."[33] After the 2007–08 financial crisis, Griffin made political contributions and donations to political candidates, parties, and organizations that supported his views of limited government such as American Crossroads, the Republican Governors Association, and Restore Our Future, a Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential bid.[33][10] Griffin backed Mitt Romney's 2012 run for the presidency and has donated to former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. He donated $2.5 million to Bruce Rauner, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor.[34]
In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[35] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[36]
In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right To Rise USA and Future45.[37]
Views on market structure[edit]
In 2014 Griffin voiced his stance on issues on financial regulations and market structure and has testified at various government hearings.[38] In 2014 he gave testimony at a U.S. Senate Committee [39] hearing on "The Role of Regulation in Shaping Equity Market Structure and Electronic Trading", in which he reiterated the need to have industry regulations catch up with the changes in market structure to increase the fairness and resilience of American equity markets.[38] Griffin, along with NASDAQ Executive Vice President Thomas A. Whittman and Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the NYSE, has voiced concerns about regulation failing to keep pace with changes in market structure as in the practice of dark pools discriminating against certain customer segments.[40]
In May 2008, Griffin criticized the risk management practices of Wall Street saying: "As an industry, we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that is prudent ... The capital markets are controlled by a bunch of right-out-of business school young guys who haven't really seen that much. You have a real lack of wisdom."[41] Griffin has also stated: "We, as an industry, dropped the ball. The industry needs to overhaul its thinking, accept greater regulation."[42] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker."[41] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution."[43]
Personal life[edit]
Griffin married his first wife Katherine Weingartt, who he had met in high school. Griffin later married Anne Dias-Griffin, the founder of Aragon Global Management, another Chicago-based hedge fund firm, in July 2004.[44] with whom he had three children.[44] Griffin and his wife later divorced in October 2015, citing "irreconcilable differences".[45] He is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church. The modern building is called "The Gratz Center" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[46]
In 2013, he acquired four real estate properties in Palm Beach, Florida that cost a cumulated sum of $130 million.[47] In 2014, Griffin was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's Board of Trustees.[2] He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.[48] He is also a member of a number of organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[49] Griffin serves as the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[50]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2003 Griffin made contributions to the Robin Hood Foundation.[46][51]
In October 2006, the Griffins and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded and supported the opening of a new charter school in Chicago called Woodlawn High School.[52]
In 2007 Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano.[53] The Paul Cézanne paintings have also been loaned to the Institute.[54] In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation's contributions include $10 million for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, $16 million to Children's Memorial Hospital, funding the University of Chicago’s Early Childhood Center, and others.[10][54]
The Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center, located in Chicago Heights, Illinois, is an experimental educational effort run by economics professor John A. List, from University of Chicago, to test whether investing in teachers or in parents produces better student performance in school.[55]
As of 2010[update] Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago,[10] public education,[54] the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago,[56] the Chicago Public Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[54]
Griffin also contributed to the Museum of Contemporary Art,[57][58] the "Evolving Planet" at the Field Museum of Natural History[59] and endowed professorships at the University of Chicago.[60]
In February 2014, Griffin gave $150 million to Harvard University his alma mater, largely for need-based undergraduate financial aid. At the time, it was the largest single gift in Harvard's history.[61][62][63] As of November 2014[update] Griffin had donated about $500 million to support various causes, including tens of millions to institutions in Chicago.[64]
Art collection[edit]
Griffin is one of the most active art buyers in the world. In 1999, he paid a record price of $60 million for Paul Cézanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl.[65] In October 2006, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80 million from Dreamworks co-founder David Geffen.[66]
As of February 2016[update], Griffin had purchased Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300 million, and Jackson Pollock’s 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200 million, both from David Geffen.[67]
In 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[68][69] In December 2015 he donated an unrestricted gift of $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the single largest in the history of the museum.[70][71]
Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Louis Bacon, Steven Cohen, Seth Klarman, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[72]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
