Arcos Dorados Releases 2016 Social and Environmental Impact Results in Latin America and CaribbeanTweet

Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. Class A Shares (NYSE:ARCO)Intraday Stock Chart
Today : Wednesday 26 July 2017




The 2016 Social and Environmental Impact Report details 
        achievements across key categories: People, Community, Supply Chain, 
        Food and Planet.


Providing employment and training opportunities for young people is 
        a key focus.


Arcos Dorados is aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals.


      Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee operating in 20 
      countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, announces the publication 
      of its 2016 Social and Environmental Impact Report, titled “Preparing 
      the Recipe of the Future”, which outlines significant progress the 
      Company has made against its key sustainability objectives.
    

      The Company’s plan to create shared value for its business and society 
      focuses on five main areas: People, Community, Supply Chain, Food and 
      Planet. In the report, the Company details its commitment to youth 
      employment, emphasizing its work with labor ministries, private 
      organizations, and initiatives such as the Inter-American Development 
      Bank’s New Employment Opportunities for Youth Program, which seeks to 
      provide young people with their first formal job opportunity.
    

      “As operators of the largest quick service restaurant chain in Latin 
      America and the Caribbean, we are taking an industry leadership role 
      regarding sustainability,” said Sergio Alonso, CEO of Arcos Dorados. 
      “Sustainability is an important component of our strategy and identity. 
      I am proud of the progress we have made and we are guided by clear 
      sustainability goals as we strive to operate our business in a manner 
      that benefits the environment and the communities we serve. Our 
      extensive footprint spanning twenty countries means we are agents of 
      change in Latin America and the Caribbean, and our actions have 
      widespread benefits.”
    


People: Arcos Dorados offered more than 73,000 young people 
        across Latin America their first job opportunity in 2016, providing 
        its youngest employees with broadly applicable technical and 
        leadership training. The Company also works with labor ministries and 
        private organizations to act as a catalyst for social mobility for 
        young people who wish to enter the labor market.More 
        broadly, Arcos Dorados partners with academic institutions to provide 
        ongoing training for managers. McDonald’s University in São Paulo 
        offers a Master’s in Strategies for Sustainable Development in 
        conjunction with the FIA Business School in São Paulo and the 
        prestigious Getulio Vargas Foundation. With respect to gender 
        diversity, 53% of the Company’s restaurant managers and corporate 
        associates are female. Arcos Dorados Mexico was recently ranked as one 
        of the top companies for gender equality. The Company is also 
        committed to creating an inclusive culture for employees with 
        disabilities and in 2016 there were almost 1,300 people employed with 
        disabilities.
      



Community: Among its activities to support the communities in 
        which it operates, the McHappy Day is a day on which Arcos Dorados 
        donates 100% of Big Mac sales to charitable causes in each market, 
        including Ronald McDonald House Charities, which helped over 122,000 
        families in 2016. In addition, as of the end of 2016, Arcos Dorados 
        employed approximately 1,300 people with motor and/or intellectual 
        disabilities in its restaurants, and in Colombia in particular, 150 
        young people with impaired hearing as well as approximately 1,200 
        vulnerable youths, including those displaced by violence.
      

Supply Chain, Food and Planet: Many of Arcos Dorados’ products 
        are sustainably sourced. For example, in Brazil - Arcos Dorados’ 
        largest market - all the coffee and fish served is certified as 
        sustainably produced. The Company also utilizes paper packaging that 
        is developed in a sustainable manner and recyclable where possible. By 
        the year 2020, Arcos Dorados has committed to sustainably sourcing all 
        of its packaging, coffee, palm oil and fish. Since 2012, Arcos Dorados 
        has implemented efficiencies which enable restaurants to reduce energy 
        consumption by up to 5% each year. Restaurants in the Company’s seven 
        largest markets are also implementing the Natal program, an initiative 
        in which the water condensation from air conditioners is repurposed 
        for other uses in order to reduce the restaurant’s total water usage. 
        In addition, initiatives to support communities in which the Company 
        operates include local sourcing, with over 90% of the restaurant 
        chain’s suppliers comprising local producers. The Company strives to 
        promote the transparency of its operations, and in 2016 invited over 
        3.1 million guests into its kitchens as part of the ongoing Open Doors 
        program.
      


      Woods Staton, Chairman of Arcos Dorados noted: “As a particular 
      area of focus, we are dedicated to providing employment opportunities 
      for young people and ensuring they have access to the most comprehensive 
      training programs in the region. Our employees are the face of the Arcos 
      Dorados family and we are proud to work together to support the 
      communities in which we operate.”

Why Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. Stock Has Jumped 52% So Far This Year
The McDonald's franchisee rose on two strong earnings reports. 











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Jul 12, 2017 at 10:36PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) have surged thus far this year, climbing on a pair of strong earnings reports. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock has gained 52% so far in 2017.

Image source: McDonald's.

Shares of the McDonald's franchisee have moved been volatile and were up as much as 75% earlier in the year:

ARCO data by YCharts
So what
The largest McDonald's franchisee, which owns around 2,000 of the fast-food locations in Latin America, had its best day of the year on March 15, when the stock jumped 20% on a strong fourth-quarter earnings report. On a constant-currency basis excluding Venezuela, revenue increased 14.2% in the quarter, and earnings per share improved from $0.03 the year before to $0.10. That beat estimates at $0.06 a share.
The stock popped again on a strong first-quarter earnings report at the beginning of May, with adjusted revenue growing 17% and earnings per share improving from $0.08 to $0.19 as the company's turnaround under CEO Sergio Alonso continues to take hold. 
Later that month, however, the stock gave back much of those gains during a massive Brazil-based sell-off resulting from a corruption scandal in the country. About half of Arcos Dorados' restaurants are located in Brazil. 





Now what
Shares of Arcos Dorados had fallen to nearly $2 a share back in early 2016, as losses piled up in what had been a disastrous stock since its 2011. However, the company has since sold off some stores to shore up its balance sheet and has been benefiting form an improving economy in Brazil, which is emerging from a recession, and elsewhere in Latin America. Considering the strength of the McDonald's brand, the stock is likely to continue to recover as macroeconomics improve and increasing profits allow the company pay down debt and refinance at lower interest rates.

Why Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. Stock Has Jumped 52% So Far This Year
The McDonald's franchisee rose on two strong earnings reports.

What happened
Shares of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) have surged thus far this year, climbing on a pair of strong earnings reports. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock has gained 52% so far in 2017.

Image source: McDonald's.

Shares of the McDonald's franchisee have moved been volatile and were up as much as 75% earlier in the year:

ARCO data by YCharts
So what
The largest McDonald's franchisee, which owns around 2,000 of the fast-food locations in Latin America, had its best day of the year on March 15, when the stock jumped 20% on a strong fourth-quarter earnings report. On a constant-currency basis excluding Venezuela, revenue increased 14.2% in the quarter, and earnings per share improved from $0.03 the year before to $0.10. That beat estimates at $0.06 a share.
The stock popped again on a strong first-quarter earnings report at the beginning of May, with adjusted revenue growing 17% and earnings per share improving from $0.08 to $0.19 as the company's turnaround under CEO Sergio Alonso continues to take hold. 
Later that month, however, the stock gave back much of those gains during a massive Brazil-based sell-off resulting from a corruption scandal in the country. About half of Arcos Dorados' restaurants are located in Brazil. 





Now what
Shares of Arcos Dorados had fallen to nearly $2 a share back in early 2016, as losses piled up in what had been a disastrous stock since its 2011. However, the company has since sold off some stores to shore up its balance sheet and has been benefiting form an improving economy in Brazil, which is emerging from a recession, and elsewhere in Latin America. Considering the strength of the McDonald's brand, the stock is likely to continue to recover as macroeconomics improve and increasing profits allow the company pay down debt and refinance at lower interest rates.

Business areas[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates in 20 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. The company dedicated itself as the organizer of the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide customer service training to more than 15,000 World Cup volunteers.[5]
History[edit]
McDonald’s has a long history in Latin America and the Caribbean, dating to the opening of its first restaurant in Puerto Rico in 1967. Since then, McDonald’s expanded its presence across the region, opening its first stores in Costa Rica in 1970, in Brazil in 1979, in Mexico and Venezuela in 1985 and in Argentina in 1986.[6]
Arcos Dorados was formed on August 3, 2007, as a result of the acquisition of McDonald’s Latin American business by the region’s operations managers.[7] Prior to the acquisition, Woods Staton, Arcos Dorados’ Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, was the joint venture partner of McDonald’s in Argentina for more than 20 years and also served as President of McDonald’s South Latin America division from 2004 until the acquisition. Arcos Dorados announced its initial public offering and became a publicly traded company on April 14, 2011 after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
Operations[edit]
With nearly $3.8 billion in sales in 2012, Arcos Dorados represents 5.6 percent of McDonald’s global sales.[6] In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is the largest fast food chain and is more than three times the size of its closest competitor.[9] Compared to the US, Latin America has fewer McDonald’s per person. There's one McDonald's for every 22,200 citizens in the United States. In Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama there's one restaurant for every 254,000 citizens; in Brazil there's one for every 310,700 citizens; and in the rest of South America, there's one for every 317,400 citizens.[10]
Company-operated and franchised restaurants[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates its McDonald’s-branded restaurants under two structures: Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Arcos Dorados owns, manages and operates approximately 75 percent of its restaurants.[11][citation needed][unreliable source?]
Restaurants operated and managed by franchisees account roughly for the remaining 25% of affiliated locations. They receive technical and operational support from Arcos Dorados, including training programs, operations manuals, access to its supply and distribution network and marketing assistance.[6]
McCafé locations and Dessert Centers[edit]
Launched in 1999, the McCafé concept is meant to attract new customers, particularly during breakfast and after lunch,[12] in separate areas within restaurants where customers can buy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, hot and iced premium coffees and hot chocolate. As of 2012, there were 334 McCafé locations in Latin America.[11]
"Dessert Centers," operate separately from existing restaurants,[12] offering traditional McDonald’s desserts like the McFlurry and soft-serve ice cream. As of 2012, there were 1,952 Dessert Centers in Latin America. The first Dessert Center opened in Costa Rica in 1986.
Reimaging[edit]
Arcos Dorados has been updating its McDonald’s restaurants throughout the region. Between 2010 and 2012, more than 260 restaurants were fully renovated [6] with larger gathering areas, warmer colors, contemporary furniture, artwork,[13] large windows allowing more natural light and often have outdoor space with tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining.
Menu[edit]
Arcos Dorados’ menus feature the same core items as McDonald’s throughout the world, including hamburgers, fries, salads and chicken sandwiches, but also includes foods unique to the region. A few examples include a flan-like dessert in Peru, dulce de leche sundaes in Argentina and the McMollette (English muffin with refried beans, cheese and salsa).[14]
A typical menu includes three tiers of options: affordable entry-level options, such as the Big Pleasures, Small Prices or "Combo del Día" ("Daily Extra Value Meal") offerings; core menu options, such as the Big Mac, Happy Meal and Quarter Pounder; and premium options, such as Big Tasty or Angus premium hamburgers and chicken sandwiches.[15]
Nutrition and well-being[edit]
Faced with increasing scrutiny of the McDonald’s brand worldwide, Arcos Dorados began implementing changes to its menu in 2007, including introducing side salads as a substitute for French fries, adding fruit in Happy Meals, and entrée salads.
In 2011, Arcos Dorados launched a new Happy Meal, with reduced sodium, calorie and fat totals.[16] Now all Happy Meal combinations in Latin America contain less than 600 calories – less than one-third of the daily calorie intake recommended for children by the World Health Organization. They also include a serving of fresh fruit.[17] Also in 2011, sodium in buns, McNuggets, cheese and ketchup were reduced by an average of 10 percent.[16]
Arcos Dorados was the first restaurant chain in Latin America to publish all its calorie content in its restaurant boards in 2013.[18] Nutritional information for McDonald’s food can be found in all restaurants at posters near the counter, and on paper mats that line the meal trays. Full nutritional information on every food item is available on its websites.[19]
In 2011 Arcos Dorados launched a website, "Eat and Learn" in Brazil. The website includes nutritional guidelines, recipes and advice from doctors and nutritionists.[20] Arcos Dorados also sponsors several educational, sports and well-being programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. One event is the McDonald’s 5K Women Run, (Las Mujeres Corremos)[21] a regional event involving more than 60,000 women in 22 cities and 19 countries in Latin America.
Advertising and promotion[edit]
Through McDonald’s, Arcos Dorados sponsors several global sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil.[22] As part of its FIFA sponsorship, Arcos Dorados is training the volunteer force that will work on the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 and 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil over the next two years. The online training will equip the volunteers with tips and strategies for interacting with people from different cultures. There will also be additional in-person training for those selected to work specifically in hospitality services.[22]
The company uses similar advertising and in-store campaigns as McDonald’s. For example, the McDonald’s Monopoly campaign, which has been a global campaign for many years, is run in several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
McDonald’s has been targeted by advocacy groups to end advertising and marketing to children. In 2008, Arcos Dorados implemented McDonald’s Children's Marketing Global Guidelines which stipulate that the company communicate balanced food choices that fit within a child's nutritional needs; use its licensed characters and properties to encourage physical activity and promote balanced food choices for children; instill positive messages about well-being, body, mind and spirit; provide national information to help parents and families make informed choices, and engage third parties to help guide its efforts.[23]
Employees[edit]
Arcos Dorados is one of the largest employers in Latin America with 94,000 employees. For most of its employees, Arcos Dorados is their first employer, with formal pay, benefits and training.
Arcos Dorados has a structured training program that helps with personal and professional development. McDonald’s University trains restaurant managers, mid-managers and owners/operators on best practices in restaurant and people management, sales, marketing and accounting. Additional management training curriculums are available for employees who want to advance within the company. More than 52,000 people from across Latin America have participated in McDonald’s University courses and educational activities.[21]
A 2011 survey of 40,000 firms in Latin America and the Caribbean indicated that half of the companies across the region are struggling to find qualified employees. In April 2012, Arcos Dorados became one of the first companies to join the New Employment Opportunities (NEO) Program. Developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Youth Foundation, the program helps to increase the employability of the region’s youth.[24] Its goal is to increase job entry among poor and low income young people. Corporate participation in the program involves an initial investment from sponsors of $37 million in cash and in-kind resources.[25][citation needed]
Arcos Dorados is consistently ranked as one of the best places to work in Latin America. The Great Place to Work Institute ranked the company fourth among the top 25 best multinational employers in Latin America in 2012 and sixth in 2013,[26] and it led the "Súper Empresas" (Super Companies) ranking by the Expansión/CNN magazine.[27]
The company has strong relationships with unions in many countries and includes unionized labor among its workers. In Brazil, some unions have challenged the company on part-time or flexible working hours.
Charity[edit]
One of Arcos Dorados’ major charitable causes is the Ronald McDonald House Charities.[28] As of 2012, there were 35 Ronald McDonald House Charities programs in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes 16 Ronald McDonald Houses; 18 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, and one Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which was built to deliver pediatric care services to remote locations.[6]
McHappy Day, McDonald’s global fundraiser for RMHC, raises money for various children’s causes, including the Ronald McDonald House Charities foundation, through proceeds from the sales of Big Macs.[29] In 2012, McHappy Day in Latin America raised nearly $15 million for RMHC.[30]
Environmental and social responsibility[edit]
Sustainable food sourcing[edit]
There are many myths and misperceptions about the quality of McDonald’s products, including ingredients and additives in its beef products. A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called "Beyond our Kitchen" or "Mas Alla De La Cocina" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald’s restaurants and [31] addresses questions about the quality of McDonald’s food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant.
Globally, McDonald’s has worked with animal welfare expert, Dr. Temple Grandin, since the mid-1990s to help ensure animals in the supply chain are properly cared for.[32] McDonald's is currently in discussion with its pork suppliers to explore ways to phase out gestation stalls for pigs and is working with producers and suppliers to develop traceability systems to prove that the meat it buys is not from farms that use gestation stalls.[33]
McDonald’s became a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) in 2012. The group is working to advance the sustainable production of beef through the commitment of stakeholders in the beef value chain.[34] One hundred percent of Arcos Dorados’ beef and oil suppliers have committed to ending procurement of any goods produced as a consequence of any forest clearance from the Amazon.
Supply chain[edit]
All of Arcos Dorados food and paper suppliers comply with McDonald’s Supplier Workplace Accountability policy, which stipulates that workers are compensated and treated fairly, work in safe conditions and produce high quality foods and packaging.[35]
Arcos Dorados also surveys and audits its suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure their operations meet McDonald’s quality, health and safety standards. The company has check points throughout the supply chain to ensure food safety, cleanliness and consistency based on globally recognized, established industry standards including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP).
Reducing consumption[edit]
McDonald’s restaurants use a significant amount of energy, specifically in cold storage to protect food safety. During the past several years, Arcos Dorados implemented a restaurant maintenance strategy to reduce water consumption, energy utilization where possible and waste reduction at its restaurants.
As one example, the company developed a collection and storage system for the water generated through condensation from the air conditioning equipment. They used the collected water to clean external areas and to water plants, reducing daily water consumption at one restaurant in Brazil from 8,000 liters to 6,800 liters.[36]

Environmental and social responsibility[edit]
Sustainable food sourcing[edit]
There are many myths and misperceptions about the quality of McDonald’s products, including ingredients and additives in its beef products. A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called "Beyond our Kitchen" or "Mas Alla De La Cocina" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald’s restaurants and [31] addresses questions about the quality of McDonald’s food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant.
Globally, McDonald’s has worked with animal welfare expert, Dr. Temple Grandin, since the mid-1990s to help ensure animals in the supply chain are properly cared for.[32] McDonald's is currently in discussion with its pork suppliers to explore ways to phase out gestation stalls for pigs and is working with producers and suppliers to develop traceability systems to prove that the meat it buys is not from farms that use gestation stalls.[33]
McDonald’s became a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) in 2012. The group is working to advance the sustainable production of beef through the commitment of stakeholders in the beef value chain.[34] One hundred percent of Arcos Dorados’ beef and oil suppliers have committed to ending procurement of any goods produced as a consequence of any forest clearance from the Amazon.
Supply chain[edit]
All of Arcos Dorados food and paper suppliers comply with McDonald’s Supplier Workplace Accountability policy, which stipulates that workers are compensated and treated fairly, work in safe conditions and produce high quality foods and packaging.[35]
Arcos Dorados also surveys and audits its suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure their operations meet McDonald’s quality, health and safety standards. The company has check points throughout the supply chain to ensure food safety, cleanliness and consistency based on globally recognized, established industry standards including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP).
Reducing consumption[edit]
McDonald’s restaurants use a significant amount of energy, specifically in cold storage to protect food safety. During the past several years, Arcos Dorados implemented a restaurant maintenance strategy to reduce water consumption, energy utilization where possible and waste reduction at its restaurants.
As one example, the company developed a collection and storage system for the water generated through condensation from the air conditioning equipment. They used the collected water to clean external areas and to water plants, reducing daily water consumption at one restaurant in Brazil from 8,000 liters to 6,800 liters.[36]

Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. is McDonald’s largest franchisee in the world in terms of systemwide sales and number of restaurants.[3] As of December 31, 2010, it represented 6.7% of McDonald’s franchised restaurants globally.[4] As the largest operator of McDonald's restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean, it has more than 94,000 employees, being one of the region's leading employers of young, first-time job holders. It serves more than 4.3 million customers daily and is the largest quick service restaurant (QSR) chain in Latin America and the Caribbean.[3]
The company operates its McDonald’s-branded restaurants as company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants.[4] Company revenues depend sales made by company-operated restaurants and rental income from franchised restaurants. The rental income depends on the greater of a flat fee or a percentage of sales.[4]

Business areas[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates in 20 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. The company dedicated itself as the organizer of the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide customer service training to more than 15,000 World Cup volunteers.[5]
History[edit]
McDonald’s has a long history in Latin America and the Caribbean, dating to the opening of its first restaurant in Puerto Rico in 1967. Since then, McDonald’s expanded its presence across the region, opening its first stores in Costa Rica in 1970, in Brazil in 1979, in Mexico and Venezuela in 1985 and in Argentina in 1986.[6]
Arcos Dorados was formed on August 3, 2007, as a result of the acquisition of McDonald’s Latin American business by the region’s operations managers.[7] Prior to the acquisition, Woods Staton, Arcos Dorados’ Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, was the joint venture partner of McDonald’s in Argentina for more than 20 years and also served as President of McDonald’s South Latin America division from 2004 until the acquisition. Arcos Dorados announced its initial public offering and became a publicly traded company on April 14, 2011 after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
Operations[edit]
With nearly $3.8 billion in sales in 2012, Arcos Dorados represents 5.6 percent of McDonald’s global sales.[6] In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is the largest fast food chain and is more than three times the size of its closest competitor.[9] Compared to the US, Latin America has fewer McDonald’s per person. There's one McDonald's for every 22,200 citizens in the United States. In Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama there's one restaurant for every 254,000 citizens; in Brazil there's one for every 310,700 citizens; and in the rest of South America, there's one for every 317,400 citizens.[10]
Company-operated and franchised restaurants[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates its McDonald’s-branded restaurants under two structures: Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Arcos Dorados owns, manages and operates approximately 75 percent of its restaurants.[11][citation needed][unreliable source?]
Restaurants operated and managed by franchisees account roughly for the remaining 25% of affiliated locations. They receive technical and operational support from Arcos Dorados, including training programs, operations manuals, access to its supply and distribution network and marketing assistance.[6]
McCafé locations and Dessert Centers[edit]
Launched in 1999, the McCafé concept is meant to attract new customers, particularly during breakfast and after lunch,[12] in separate areas within restaurants where customers can buy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, hot and iced premium coffees and hot chocolate. As of 2012, there were 334 McCafé locations in Latin America.[11]
"Dessert Centers," operate separately from existing restaurants,[12] offering traditional McDonald’s desserts like the McFlurry and soft-serve ice cream. As of 2012, there were 1,952 Dessert Centers in Latin America. The first Dessert Center opened in Costa Rica in 1986.
Reimaging[edit]
Arcos Dorados has been updating its McDonald’s restaurants throughout the region. Between 2010 and 2012, more than 260 restaurants were fully renovated [6] with larger gathering areas, warmer colors, contemporary furniture, artwork,[13] large windows allowing more natural light and often have outdoor space with tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining.
Menu[edit]
Arcos Dorados’ menus feature the same core items as McDonald’s throughout the world, including hamburgers, fries, salads and chicken sandwiches, but also includes foods unique to the region. A few examples include a flan-like dessert in Peru, dulce de leche sundaes in Argentina and the McMollette (English muffin with refried beans, cheese and salsa).[14]
A typical menu includes three tiers of options: affordable entry-level options, such as the Big Pleasures, Small Prices or "Combo del Día" ("Daily Extra Value Meal") offerings; core menu options, such as the Big Mac, Happy Meal and Quarter Pounder; and premium options, such as Big Tasty or Angus premium hamburgers and chicken sandwiches.[15]
Nutrition and well-being[edit]
Faced with increasing scrutiny of the McDonald’s brand worldwide, Arcos Dorados began implementing changes to its menu in 2007, including introducing side salads as a substitute for French fries, adding fruit in Happy Meals, and entrée salads.
In 2011, Arcos Dorados launched a new Happy Meal, with reduced sodium, calorie and fat totals.[16] Now all Happy Meal combinations in Latin America contain less than 600 calories – less than one-third of the daily calorie intake recommended for children by the World Health Organization. They also include a serving of fresh fruit.[17] Also in 2011, sodium in buns, McNuggets, cheese and ketchup were reduced by an average of 10 percent.[16]
Arcos Dorados was the first restaurant chain in Latin America to publish all its calorie content in its restaurant boards in 2013.[18] Nutritional information for McDonald’s food can be found in all restaurants at posters near the counter, and on paper mats that line the meal trays. Full nutritional information on every food item is available on its websites.[19]
In 2011 Arcos Dorados launched a website, "Eat and Learn" in Brazil. The website includes nutritional guidelines, recipes and advice from doctors and nutritionists.[20] Arcos Dorados also sponsors several educational, sports and well-being programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. One event is the McDonald’s 5K Women Run, (Las Mujeres Corremos)[21] a regional event involving more than 60,000 women in 22 cities and 19 countries in Latin America.
Advertising and promotion[edit]
Through McDonald’s, Arcos Dorados sponsors several global sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil.[22] As part of its FIFA sponsorship, Arcos Dorados is training the volunteer force that will work on the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 and 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil over the next two years. The online training will equip the volunteers with tips and strategies for interacting with people from different cultures. There will also be additional in-person training for those selected to work specifically in hospitality services.[22]
The company uses similar advertising and in-store campaigns as McDonald’s. For example, the McDonald’s Monopoly campaign, which has been a global campaign for many years, is run in several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
McDonald’s has been targeted by advocacy groups to end advertising and marketing to children. In 2008, Arcos Dorados implemented McDonald’s Children's Marketing Global Guidelines which stipulate that the company communicate balanced food choices that fit within a child's nutritional needs; use its licensed characters and properties to encourage physical activity and promote balanced food choices for children; instill positive messages about well-being, body, mind and spirit; provide national information to help parents and families make informed choices, and engage third parties to help guide its efforts.[23]
Employees[edit]
Arcos Dorados is one of the largest employers in Latin America with 94,000 employees. For most of its employees, Arcos Dorados is their first employer, with formal pay, benefits and training.
Arcos Dorados has a structured training program that helps with personal and professional development. McDonald’s University trains restaurant managers, mid-managers and owners/operators on best practices in restaurant and people management, sales, marketing and accounting. Additional management training curriculums are available for employees who want to advance within the company. More than 52,000 people from across Latin America have participated in McDonald’s University courses and educational activities.[21]
A 2011 survey of 40,000 firms in Latin America and the Caribbean indicated that half of the companies across the region are struggling to find qualified employees. In April 2012, Arcos Dorados became one of the first companies to join the New Employment Opportunities (NEO) Program. Developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Youth Foundation, the program helps to increase the employability of the region’s youth.[24] Its goal is to increase job entry among poor and low income young people. Corporate participation in the program involves an initial investment from sponsors of $37 million in cash and in-kind resources.[25][citation needed]
Arcos Dorados is consistently ranked as one of the best places to work in Latin America. The Great Place to Work Institute ranked the company fourth among the top 25 best multinational employers in Latin America in 2012 and sixth in 2013,[26] and it led the "Súper Empresas" (Super Companies) ranking by the Expansión/CNN magazine.[27]
The company has strong relationships with unions in many countries and includes unionized labor among its workers. In Brazil, some unions have challenged the company on part-time or flexible working hours.
Charity[edit]
One of Arcos Dorados’ major charitable causes is the Ronald McDonald House Charities.[28] As of 2012, there were 35 Ronald McDonald House Charities programs in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes 16 Ronald McDonald Houses; 18 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, and one Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which was built to deliver pediatric care services to remote locations.[6]
McHappy Day, McDonald’s global fundraiser for RMHC, raises money for various children’s causes, including the Ronald McDonald House Charities foundation, through proceeds from the sales of Big Macs.[29] In 2012, McHappy Day in Latin America raised nearly $15 million for RMHC.[30]

Business areas[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates in 20 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. The company dedicated itself as the organizer of the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide customer service training to more than 15,000 World Cup volunteers.[5]
History[edit]
McDonald’s has a long history in Latin America and the Caribbean, dating to the opening of its first restaurant in Puerto Rico in 1967. Since then, McDonald’s expanded its presence across the region, opening its first stores in Costa Rica in 1970, in Brazil in 1979, in Mexico and Venezuela in 1985 and in Argentina in 1986.[6]
Arcos Dorados was formed on August 3, 2007, as a result of the acquisition of McDonald’s Latin American business by the region’s operations managers.[7] Prior to the acquisition, Woods Staton, Arcos Dorados’ Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, was the joint venture partner of McDonald’s in Argentina for more than 20 years and also served as President of McDonald’s South Latin America division from 2004 until the acquisition. Arcos Dorados announced its initial public offering and became a publicly traded company on April 14, 2011 after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
Operations[edit]
With nearly $3.8 billion in sales in 2012, Arcos Dorados represents 5.6 percent of McDonald’s global sales.[6] In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is the largest fast food chain and is more than three times the size of its closest competitor.[9] Compared to the US, Latin America has fewer McDonald’s per person. There's one McDonald's for every 22,200 citizens in the United States. In Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama there's one restaurant for every 254,000 citizens; in Brazil there's one for every 310,700 citizens; and in the rest of South America, there's one for every 317,400 citizens.[10]
Company-operated and franchised restaurants[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates its McDonald’s-branded restaurants under two structures: Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Arcos Dorados owns, manages and operates approximately 75 percent of its restaurants.[11][citation needed][unreliable source?]
Restaurants operated and managed by franchisees account roughly for the remaining 25% of affiliated locations. They receive technical and operational support from Arcos Dorados, including training programs, operations manuals, access to its supply and distribution network and marketing assistance.[6]
McCafé locations and Dessert Centers[edit]
Launched in 1999, the McCafé concept is meant to attract new customers, particularly during breakfast and after lunch,[12] in separate areas within restaurants where customers can buy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, hot and iced premium coffees and hot chocolate. As of 2012, there were 334 McCafé locations in Latin America.[11]
"Dessert Centers," operate separately from existing restaurants,[12] offering traditional McDonald’s desserts like the McFlurry and soft-serve ice cream. As of 2012, there were 1,952 Dessert Centers in Latin America. The first Dessert Center opened in Costa Rica in 1986.
Reimaging[edit]
Arcos Dorados has been updating its McDonald’s restaurants throughout the region. Between 2010 and 2012, more than 260 restaurants were fully renovated [6] with larger gathering areas, warmer colors, contemporary furniture, artwork,[13] large windows allowing more natural light and often have outdoor space with tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining.
Menu[edit]
Arcos Dorados’ menus feature the same core items as McDonald’s throughout the world, including hamburgers, fries, salads and chicken sandwiches, but also includes foods unique to the region. A few examples include a flan-like dessert in Peru, dulce de leche sundaes in Argentina and the McMollette (English muffin with refried beans, cheese and salsa).[14]
A typical menu includes three tiers of options: affordable entry-level options, such as the Big Pleasures, Small Prices or "Combo del Día" ("Daily Extra Value Meal") offerings; core menu options, such as the Big Mac, Happy Meal and Quarter Pounder; and premium options, such as Big Tasty or Angus premium hamburgers and chicken sandwiches.[15]
Nutrition and well-being[edit]
Faced with increasing scrutiny of the McDonald’s brand worldwide, Arcos Dorados began implementing changes to its menu in 2007, including introducing side salads as a substitute for French fries, adding fruit in Happy Meals, and entrée salads.
In 2011, Arcos Dorados launched a new Happy Meal, with reduced sodium, calorie and fat totals.[16] Now all Happy Meal combinations in Latin America contain less than 600 calories – less than one-third of the daily calorie intake recommended for children by the World Health Organization. They also include a serving of fresh fruit.[17] Also in 2011, sodium in buns, McNuggets, cheese and ketchup were reduced by an average of 10 percent.[16]
Arcos Dorados was the first restaurant chain in Latin America to publish all its calorie content in its restaurant boards in 2013.[18] Nutritional information for McDonald’s food can be found in all restaurants at posters near the counter, and on paper mats that line the meal trays. Full nutritional information on every food item is available on its websites.[19]
In 2011 Arcos Dorados launched a website, "Eat and Learn" in Brazil. The website includes nutritional guidelines, recipes and advice from doctors and nutritionists.[20] Arcos Dorados also sponsors several educational, sports and well-being programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. One event is the McDonald’s 5K Women Run, (Las Mujeres Corremos)[21] a regional event involving more than 60,000 women in 22 cities and 19 countries in Latin America.
Advertising and promotion[edit]
Through McDonald’s, Arcos Dorados sponsors several global sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil.[22] As part of its FIFA sponsorship, Arcos Dorados is training the volunteer force that will work on the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 and 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil over the next two years. The online training will equip the volunteers with tips and strategies for interacting with people from different cultures. There will also be additional in-person training for those selected to work specifically in hospitality services.[22]
The company uses similar advertising and in-store campaigns as McDonald’s. For example, the McDonald’s Monopoly campaign, which has been a global campaign for many years, is run in several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
McDonald’s has been targeted by advocacy groups to end advertising and marketing to children. In 2008, Arcos Dorados implemented McDonald’s Children's Marketing Global Guidelines which stipulate that the company communicate balanced food choices that fit within a child's nutritional needs; use its licensed characters and properties to encourage physical activity and promote balanced food choices for children; instill positive messages about well-being, body, mind and spirit; provide national information to help parents and families make informed choices, and engage third parties to help guide its efforts.[23]
Employees[edit]
Arcos Dorados is one of the largest employers in Latin America with 94,000 employees. For most of its employees, Arcos Dorados is their first employer, with formal pay, benefits and training.
Arcos Dorados has a structured training program that helps with personal and professional development. McDonald’s University trains restaurant managers, mid-managers and owners/operators on best practices in restaurant and people management, sales, marketing and accounting. Additional management training curriculums are available for employees who want to advance within the company. More than 52,000 people from across Latin America have participated in McDonald’s University courses and educational activities.[21]
A 2011 survey of 40,000 firms in Latin America and the Caribbean indicated that half of the companies across the region are struggling to find qualified employees. In April 2012, Arcos Dorados became one of the first companies to join the New Employment Opportunities (NEO) Program. Developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Youth Foundation, the program helps to increase the employability of the region’s youth.[24] Its goal is to increase job entry among poor and low income young people. Corporate participation in the program involves an initial investment from sponsors of $37 million in cash and in-kind resources.[25][citation needed]
Arcos Dorados is consistently ranked as one of the best places to work in Latin America. The Great Place to Work Institute ranked the company fourth among the top 25 best multinational employers in Latin America in 2012 and sixth in 2013,[26] and it led the "Súper Empresas" (Super Companies) ranking by the Expansión/CNN magazine.[27]
The company has strong relationships with unions in many countries and includes unionized labor among its workers. In Brazil, some unions have challenged the company on part-time or flexible working hours.
Charity[edit]
One of Arcos Dorados’ major charitable causes is the Ronald McDonald House Charities.[28] As of 2012, there were 35 Ronald McDonald House Charities programs in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes 16 Ronald McDonald Houses; 18 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, and one Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which was built to deliver pediatric care services to remote locations.[6]
McHappy Day, McDonald’s global fundraiser for RMHC, raises money for various children’s causes, including the Ronald McDonald House Charities foundation, through proceeds from the sales of Big Macs.[29] In 2012, McHappy Day in Latin America raised nearly $15 million for RMHC.[30]
Environmental and social responsibility[edit]
Sustainable food sourcing[edit]
There are many myths and misperceptions about the quality of McDonald’s products, including ingredients and additives in its beef products. A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called "Beyond our Kitchen" or "Mas Alla De La Cocina" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald’s restaurants and [31] addresses questions about the quality of McDonald’s food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant.
Globally, McDonald’s has worked with animal welfare expert, Dr. Temple Grandin, since the mid-1990s to help ensure animals in the supply chain are properly cared for.[32] McDonald's is currently in discussion with its pork suppliers to explore ways to phase out gestation stalls for pigs and is working with producers and suppliers to develop traceability systems to prove that the meat it buys is not from farms that use gestation stalls.[33]
McDonald’s became a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) in 2012. The group is working to advance the sustainable production of beef through the commitment of stakeholders in the beef value chain.[34] One hundred percent of Arcos Dorados’ beef and oil suppliers have committed to ending procurement of any goods produced as a consequence of any forest clearance from the Amazon.
Supply chain[edit]
All of Arcos Dorados food and paper suppliers comply with McDonald’s Supplier Workplace Accountability policy, which stipulates that workers are compensated and treated fairly, work in safe conditions and produce high quality foods and packaging.[35]
Arcos Dorados also surveys and audits its suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure their operations meet McDonald’s quality, health and safety standards. The company has check points throughout the supply chain to ensure food safety, cleanliness and consistency based on globally recognized, established industry standards including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP).
Reducing consumption[edit]
McDonald’s restaurants use a significant amount of energy, specifically in cold storage to protect food safety. During the past several years, Arcos Dorados implemented a restaurant maintenance strategy to reduce water consumption, energy utilization where possible and waste reduction at its restaurants.
As one example, the company developed a collection and storage system for the water generated through condensation from the air conditioning equipment. They used the collected water to clean external areas and to water plants, reducing daily water consumption at one restaurant in Brazil from 8,000 liters to 6,800 liters.[36]

A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called "Beyond our Kitchen" or "Mas Alla De La Cocina" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald’s restaurants and [31] addresses questions about the quality of McDonald’s food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant.
Globally, McDonald’s has worked with animal welfare expert, Dr. Temple Grandin, since the mid-1990s to help ensure animals in the supply chain are properly cared for.[32] McDonald's is currently in discussion with its pork suppliers to explore ways to phase out gestation stalls for pigs and is working with producers and suppliers to develop traceability systems to prove that the meat it buys is not from farms that use gestation stalls.[33]
McDonald’s became a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) in 2012. The group is working to advance the sustainable production of beef through the commitment of stakeholders in the beef value chain.[34] One hundred percent of Arcos Dorados’ beef and oil suppliers have committed to ending procurement of any goods produced as a consequence of any forest clearance from the Amazon.
Supply chain[edit]
All of Arcos Dorados food and paper suppliers comply with McDonald’s Supplier Workplace Accountability policy, which stipulates that workers are compensated and treated fairly, work in safe conditions and produce high quality foods and packaging.[35]
Arcos Dorados also surveys and audits its suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure their operations meet McDonald’s quality, health and safety standards. The company has check points throughout the supply chain to ensure food safety, cleanliness and consistency based on globally recognized, established industry standards including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP).
Reducing consumption[edit]
McDonald’s restaurants use a significant amount of energy, specifically in cold storage to protect food safety. During the past several years, Arcos Dorados implemented a restaurant maintenance strategy to reduce water consumption, energy utilization where possible and waste reduction at its restaurants.
As one example, the company developed a collection and storage system for the water generated through condensation from the air conditioning equipment. They used the collected water to clean external areas and to water plants, reducing daily water consumption at one restaurant in Brazil from 8,000 liters to 6,800 liters.[36]

Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. is McDonald’s largest franchisee in the world in terms of systemwide sales and number of restaurants.[3] As of December 31, 2010, it represented 6.7% of McDonald’s franchised restaurants globally.[4] As the largest operator of McDonald's restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean, it has more than 94,000 employees, being one of the region's leading employers of young, first-time job holders. It serves more than 4.3 million customers daily and is the largest quick service restaurant (QSR) chain in Latin America and the Caribbean.[3]
The company operates its McDonald’s-branded restaurants as company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants.[4] Company revenues depend sales made by company-operated restaurants and rental income from franchised restaurants. The rental income depends on the greater of a flat fee or a percentage of sales.[4]

Business areas[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates in 20 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. The company dedicated itself as the organizer of the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide customer service training to more than 15,000 World Cup volunteers.[5]
History[edit]
McDonald’s has a long history in Latin America and the Caribbean, dating to the opening of its first restaurant in Puerto Rico in 1967. Since then, McDonald’s expanded its presence across the region, opening its first stores in Costa Rica in 1970, in Brazil in 1979, in Mexico and Venezuela in 1985 and in Argentina in 1986.[6]
Arcos Dorados was formed on August 3, 2007, as a result of the acquisition of McDonald’s Latin American business by the region’s operations managers.[7] Prior to the acquisition, Woods Staton, Arcos Dorados’ Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, was the joint venture partner of McDonald’s in Argentina for more than 20 years and also served as President of McDonald’s South Latin America division from 2004 until the acquisition. Arcos Dorados announced its initial public offering and became a publicly traded company on April 14, 2011 after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
Operations[edit]
With nearly $3.8 billion in sales in 2012, Arcos Dorados represents 5.6 percent of McDonald’s global sales.[6] In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is the largest fast food chain and is more than three times the size of its closest competitor.[9] Compared to the US, Latin America has fewer McDonald’s per person. There's one McDonald's for every 22,200 citizens in the United States. In Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama there's one restaurant for every 254,000 citizens; in Brazil there's one for every 310,700 citizens; and in the rest of South America, there's one for every 317,400 citizens.[10]
Company-operated and franchised restaurants[edit]
Arcos Dorados operates its McDonald’s-branded restaurants under two structures: Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Arcos Dorados owns, manages and operates approximately 75 percent of its restaurants.[11][citation needed][unreliable source?]
Restaurants operated and managed by franchisees account roughly for the remaining 25% of affiliated locations. They receive technical and operational support from Arcos Dorados, including training programs, operations manuals, access to its supply and distribution network and marketing assistance.[6]
McCafé locations and Dessert Centers[edit]
Launched in 1999, the McCafé concept is meant to attract new customers, particularly during breakfast and after lunch,[12] in separate areas within restaurants where customers can buy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, hot and iced premium coffees and hot chocolate. As of 2012, there were 334 McCafé locations in Latin America.[11]
"Dessert Centers," operate separately from existing restaurants,[12] offering traditional McDonald’s desserts like the McFlurry and soft-serve ice cream. As of 2012, there were 1,952 Dessert Centers in Latin America. The first Dessert Center opened in Costa Rica in 1986.
Reimaging[edit]
Arcos Dorados has been updating its McDonald’s restaurants throughout the region. Between 2010 and 2012, more than 260 restaurants were fully renovated [6] with larger gathering areas, warmer colors, contemporary furniture, artwork,[13] large windows allowing more natural light and often have outdoor space with tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining.
Menu[edit]
Arcos Dorados’ menus feature the same core items as McDonald’s throughout the world, including hamburgers, fries, salads and chicken sandwiches, but also includes foods unique to the region. A few examples include a flan-like dessert in Peru, dulce de leche sundaes in Argentina and the McMollette (English muffin with refried beans, cheese and salsa).[14]
A typical menu includes three tiers of options: affordable entry-level options, such as the Big Pleasures, Small Prices or "Combo del Día" ("Daily Extra Value Meal") offerings; core menu options, such as the Big Mac, Happy Meal and Quarter Pounder; and premium options, such as Big Tasty or Angus premium hamburgers and chicken sandwiches.[15]
Nutrition and well-being[edit]
Faced with increasing scrutiny of the McDonald’s brand worldwide, Arcos Dorados began implementing changes to its menu in 2007, including introducing side salads as a substitute for French fries, adding fruit in Happy Meals, and entrée salads.
In 2011, Arcos Dorados launched a new Happy Meal, with reduced sodium, calorie and fat totals.[16] Now all Happy Meal combinations in Latin America contain less than 600 calories – less than one-third of the daily calorie intake recommended for children by the World Health Organization. They also include a serving of fresh fruit.[17] Also in 2011, sodium in buns, McNuggets, cheese and ketchup were reduced by an average of 10 percent.[16]
Arcos Dorados was the first restaurant chain in Latin America to publish all its calorie content in its restaurant boards in 2013.[18] Nutritional information for McDonald’s food can be found in all restaurants at posters near the counter, and on paper mats that line the meal trays. Full nutritional information on every food item is available on its websites.[19]
In 2011 Arcos Dorados launched a website, "Eat and Learn" in Brazil. The website includes nutritional guidelines, recipes and advice from doctors and nutritionists.[20] Arcos Dorados also sponsors several educational, sports and well-being programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. One event is the McDonald’s 5K Women Run, (Las Mujeres Corremos)[21] a regional event involving more than 60,000 women in 22 cities and 19 countries in Latin America.
Advertising and promotion[edit]
Through McDonald’s, Arcos Dorados sponsors several global sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil.[22] As part of its FIFA sponsorship, Arcos Dorados is training the volunteer force that will work on the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 and 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil over the next two years. The online training will equip the volunteers with tips and strategies for interacting with people from different cultures. There will also be additional in-person training for those selected to work specifically in hospitality services.[22]
The company uses similar advertising and in-store campaigns as McDonald’s. For example, the McDonald’s Monopoly campaign, which has been a global campaign for many years, is run in several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
McDonald’s has been targeted by advocacy groups to end advertising and marketing to children. In 2008, Arcos Dorados implemented McDonald’s Children's Marketing Global Guidelines which stipulate that the company communicate balanced food choices that fit within a child's nutritional needs; use its licensed characters and properties to encourage physical activity and promote balanced food choices for children; instill positive messages about well-being, body, mind and spirit; provide national information to help parents and families make informed choices, and engage third parties to help guide its efforts.[23]
Employees[edit]
Arcos Dorados is one of the largest employers in Latin America with 94,000 employees. For most of its employees, Arcos Dorados is their first employer, with formal pay, benefits and training.
Arcos Dorados has a structured training program that helps with personal and professional development. McDonald’s University trains restaurant managers, mid-managers and owners/operators on best practices in restaurant and people management, sales, marketing and accounting. Additional management training curriculums are available for employees who want to advance within the company. More than 52,000 people from across Latin America have participated in McDonald’s University courses and educational activities.[21]
A 2011 survey of 40,000 firms in Latin America and the Caribbean indicated that half of the companies across the region are struggling to find qualified employees. In April 2012, Arcos Dorados became one of the first companies to join the New Employment Opportunities (NEO) Program. Developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Youth Foundation, the program helps to increase the employability of the region’s youth.[24] Its goal is to increase job entry among poor and low income young people. Corporate participation in the program involves an initial investment from sponsors of $37 million in cash and in-kind resources.[25][citation needed]
Arcos Dorados is consistently ranked as one of the best places to work in Latin America. The Great Place to Work Institute ranked the company fourth among the top 25 best multinational employers in Latin America in 2012 and sixth in 2013,[26] and it led the "Súper Empresas" (Super Companies) ranking by the Expansión/CNN magazine.[27]
The company has strong relationships with unions in many countries and includes unionized labor among its workers. In Brazil, some unions have challenged the company on part-time or flexible working hours.
Charity[edit]
One of Arcos Dorados’ major charitable causes is the Ronald McDonald House Charities.[28] As of 2012, there were 35 Ronald McDonald House Charities programs in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes 16 Ronald McDonald Houses; 18 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, and one Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which was built to deliver pediatric care services to remote locations.[6]
McHappy Day, McDonald’s global fundraiser for RMHC, raises money for various children’s causes, including the Ronald McDonald House Charities foundation, through proceeds from the sales of Big Macs.[29] In 2012, McHappy Day in Latin America raised nearly $15 million for RMHC.[30]
Environmental and social responsibility[edit]

A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called "Beyond our Kitchen" or "Mas Alla De La Cocina" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald’s restaurants and [31] addresses questions about the quality of McDonald’s food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant.

 Solid dividend growth may be one sign of a healthy stock. Investors may be watching different time periods to assess dividend growth rates. The stock currently has an 8 year dividend growth rate of -79.85%, a 5 year of -87.44%, and a 3 year of -98.18%.
FCFFree Cash Flow or FCF, may be used to gauge the true profitability of a company. FCF measures the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, and it may be a useful indicator for assessing financial performance. Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO)‘s FCF growth is presently at 0.601493. 
This is calculated by subtracting FCF from the previous year from FCF this year, divided by FCF from last year. The company has an FCF score of 0.985032. The FCF score is an indicator that is derived by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. In general, a higher FCF score value would signal high free cash flow growth. 
The current FCF quality score is 2.205664. The free quality score assists with estimating free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this number, a lower ratio is typically preferred. 
Looking a bit further, the company has an FCF yield of 0.030127, and a 5-year average FCF yield of -0.015691. The first is simply FCF divided by enterprise value, and the second is the five year average FCF divided by the current enterprise value.
SMA CrossTechnical traders and investors may be looking at the simple moving average 50/200 cross on shares of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO). At the time of writing, the SMA 50/200 Cross value is 1.24486. If the value is greater than one, the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average, which may signal positive stock price momentum. A value less than one would indicate that the 50 day moving average is below the 200 day, which may indicate negative share price momentum.
RangeInvestors often keep track of key stock price levels when doing equity research. Two standard levels are the 52-week high and 52-week low. Shares tend to come under increased scrutiny when approaching either of the two marks. 
After a recent check, the current stock price divided by the 52-week high for shares of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO), gives us a value of 0.802.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
