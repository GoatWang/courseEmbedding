Dick Dube To Retire From Old National; Joan Kissel Promoted To Chief Audit Executive And Ethics Officer






GlobeNewswire



Nov 1, 2016 11:28 AM EDT













 




























































   Dubé to retire as Chief Audit Executive and Ethics Officer on May 5, 2017 Under his leadership, Old National has been named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies™ by the Ethisphere Institute for five consecutive years (2012-16) Joan Kissel to succeed Dubé as Chief Audit Executive and Ethics Officer; will also join Old National's Executive Leadership Group   EVANSVILLE, Ind., Nov. 01, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dick Dubé, Old National's Chief Audit Executive and Ethics Officer, and a member of the company's Executive Leadership Group, has announced that he will retire May 5, 2017.  Dubé joined Old National as General Auditor in 1997, was promoted to Audit and Risk Manager in 1999, and assumed his current role of Chief Audit Executive in 2001. In 2008, Old National Chairman and CEO Bob Jones tasked Dubé with the additional responsibility of becoming Old National's first Ethics Officer. Under Dubé's guidance, Old National has been named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies™ for five straight years by the Ethisphere Institute. Old National's corporate culture and adherence to ethics have also been certified by Ethisphere for the past seven years (Ethics Inside Certification™). "As a servant leader, Dick is well known for his integrity, compassion and team-first approach," said Old National Chairman and CEO Bob Jones. "I know I speak for countless others in wishing him and his family all the best as they begin this richly earned new chapter. He will be greatly missed." Andy Goebel, Old National Bancorp Board member and Chairman of the Board's Audit Committee, said he has been extremely fortunate to have worked closely with Dubé for a number of years. "In addition to being a consummate professional who is highly regarded by his peers, Dick has been an outstanding leader of the associates in the internal audit department as well as a valued member of Old National's executive management team," said Goebel.
