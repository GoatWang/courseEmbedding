Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

agreed to in writing by Seller and such Buyer party to such Order;
provided, however, that any such waiver, alteration or other change
shall be applicable only to such Order and shall not otherwise
alter or amend the terms of this Agreement.
 

1.3         
Change Orders; C-Series Orders .
 

(a)          
Subject to the Parties’ agreement on extra cost or schedule
delays and except as otherwise provided herein, a Buyer may
reasonably increase or decrease the scope or change the schedule of
the Order at any time during the course of the work to be
performed. Any change that affects the cost or schedule of the work
to be performed, as well as changes occasioned by revised or added
specifications, drawings, data, or instructions, will be clearly
defined by the applicable Buyer in a change order in the form of
Exhibit A hereto (together with the various documents,
information, instructions and other requirements describing the
change to the work to be performed, including designs, drawings and
written specifications, a “ Change Order
”).  Any such Change Order, when received and accepted
by Seller, shall be deemed an amendment to the applicable Order,
and Seller shall comply with its terms promptly and fully. 
Unless otherwise expressly agreed and recorded in the Change Order,
such Change Order shall cover all effects of a specific variation
on the price under the applicable Order. When a Change Order
reduces or omits any part of an Order, the portion of the price
under such Order that relates to the reduction or omitted part
shall be deducted from the total price to be paid. Any change in
the Change Order shall not extend any completion date set out in
the applicable Order unless it is first approved by the applicable
Buyer in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, representatives of
the applicable Buyer shall have authority to give written
instructions to make reasonable and minor changes in the scope or
specifications of an Order to the extent such changes involve no
additional cost or schedule delays and are consistent with the
spirit and purpose of the work described in the Order. However, if
such representative’s instructions for changes to the Order
would involve any extra cost or schedule delays to the applicable
Buyer (as reasonably determined by Seller), Seller shall give such
representative prior written notice of the amount involved and
shall not commence to perform such work until after receiving a
signed Change Order from the applicable Buyer.
 

(b)          
With respect to any Order for Goods designated as
“C-Series” equipment and products, if Buyer provides
changes to the cylinder configuration of such Goods no later than
ten (10) weeks prior to the delivery date of such Goods, the
delivery date of such Goods will not be impacted.
 

1.4         
Forecast Requirements and Lead Time Notices.
 

(a)          
Buyers’ Forecast . During the first full calendar week
of each calendar month during the Term (as defined below), Buyers
(on behalf of themselves and their respective subsidiaries), shall
deliver to Seller a written forecast (the “ Forecast
Notice ”) of their good faith estimate of their
combined fabrication requirements for Goods (the “
Forecast Requirements ”) for the six
(6) month  period (or such longer or shorter period as
the Parties shall jointly agree or, if shorter, for the remainder
of the Term) beginning on the first day of the following month
(such period, the “ Forecast Period ”);
provided , however , that no Buyer shall have any
requirement to meet any Forecast Requirement nor any liability to
Seller based on any Forecast Requirement estimated in good
faith.  The Parties shall meet during the third full calendar
week of every month during the Term to review the Forecast
Requirements presented by Buyers and discuss any matters that may
impact Seller’s ability to meet the Forecast
Requirements.  Exhibit B hereto sets forth each
Buyer’s Forecast Requirements for the initial Forecast Period
beginning on the date hereof.  If either Buyer fails to
deliver a Forecast Notice when required, then the Forecast
Requirements with respect to the last month of that Forecast Period
shall be zero until such Buyer delivers its next Forecast Notice,
at which time the Forecast Requirements shall change to reflect the
Forecast Requirements set forth in that Forecast Notice.

(b)          
Seller’s Notice Obligation for Major Component Lead
Times .  Schedule V hereto sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, Seller’s anticipated delivery times
from suppliers to Seller of engines, compressors or coolers (each,
a “ Major Component ”) that may comprise
a portion of the Goods.  Schedule V shall be binding on
the Parties with respect to the Order procedures set forth in
Section 1.5 , below; provided , however ,
that Seller shall be entitled, by written (which shall include
email) notice to Buyers, to update Schedule V as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within two (2) business days,
after Seller receives notice of any changes to such delivery times
as a result of such changes, and after such update, the revised
Schedule V will be binding on the Parties with respect to
the Order procedures set forth in Section 1.5
below.
 

(c)          
Alteration of Lead Time Associated with Large Orders . 
In the event a Buyer submits an Order in good faith that requires
an increase in lead time to accommodate the size of such Order,
then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within two (2) business days,
after Seller receives such Order of any required changes to
Schedule V to accommodate such Order, and after such notice, such
new Schedule V will be binding on the Parties with respect
to the Order procedures set forth in Section 1.5
below.
 

(d)          
Additional Confidentiality Provisions .  In addition to
the confidentiality and limited-use provisions set forth in the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, including in
Section 8.10 thereof, Seller agrees not to (a) provide to
Seller’s sales personnel or sales management personnel (other
than members of Seller’s executive management, including any
senior vice president thereof) any customer-specific information
contained in the Forecast Requirements or otherwise provided to
Seller in connection with this Agreement or (b) use such
information for any purpose other than to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 

1.5         
Order Procedures .
 

(a)          
Goods, Delivery Date and Price .  Seller shall not be
required to sell to Buyers, and Buyers shall not be required to
purchase from Seller, any Goods unless and until an Order is
executed and delivered.  Purchase orders shall be made by a
Buyer’s delivery to Seller of a proposed Order that shall
specify, among other things, (i) the Goods Buyer proposes to
purchase and (ii) the proposed delivery date of such Goods to
Buyer.  Buyers shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to place all orders for Goods pursuant to
proposed Orders with delivery dates that are within the applicable
time period set forth in Section 1.5(b).   A
proposed Order with delivery dates that are within such applicable
time period shall be a “ Conforming Order
”.  Seller shall, within two (2) business days
after receipt of a proposed Order, confirm in writing its
acceptance or rejection of such Order, including the price of such
Order which shall be determined in accordance with
Section 4.1 ; provided , however , that
Seller may not reject a Conforming Order without Buyer’s
consent.
 

(b)          
Specific Delivery Dates for Conforming Orders .  For an
Order to constitute a Conforming Order, Buyer shall specify a
delivery date no earlier than the shortest applicable period
specified below:
 

(i)           
the longest period for delivery for any Major Component, as set
forth on Schedule V , plus six (6) weeks; or
 

(ii)          
the time periods provided in Schedule V , with respect to
Goods utilizing Buyer-provided inventory.
 

(c)          
Nonconforming Orders .  Buyer may, from time to time
and in good faith, place an Order for a delivery date that is not
in compliance with a Conforming Order (each such Order,
a
 
3 





 
“ Nonconforming Order
”).  In the event a Buyer places a Nonconforming Order,
Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, accept such
Nonconforming Order at the price determined in accordance with
Section 4.1 .  In lieu of accepting such order,
Seller may inform the Buyer that Seller is willing to accept the
Nonconforming Order, including the proposed delivery date, at a
price other than the price determined in accordance with
Section 4.1 or with an alternative delivery date. 
Buyer may then (i) confirm acceptance of the Nonconforming
Order at Seller’s proposed price and with Seller’s
proposed delivery date or (ii) if Seller’s proposed
price was above the price determined in accordance with
Section 4.1 or Seller’s proposed delivery date
was later than Buyer’s request, acquire the Goods subject to
such Nonconforming Order from a third party with either or both
(y) a price lower than Seller’s proposed price and/or
(z) a delivery date no later than the later of Buyer’s
proposed delivery date or Seller’s proposed delivery
date.
 

1.6         
Exclusivity Exceptions for Acquired Businesses .
 

Notwithstanding
Section 1.1 of this Agreement, if a Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries acquires, including by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, a company or the assets of a business (each, a “
Target ”):
 

(i)           
that is not a party or subject to a third party agreement for the
firm purchase and supply of Goods, then such Buyer and Seller each
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Target’s requirements for Goods to be included within the
Buyer’s Orders subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement;
 

(ii)          
that is a party or subject to a third party agreement for the firm
purchase and supply of Goods, then Buyer (A) shall be entitled
to honor any and all firm order commitments placed under that
agreement prior to the completion of the acquisition and
(B) shall not be obligated to include such Target’s
requirements under this Agreement as long as the amount of Goods
ordered from parties other than Seller in respect of the
Target’s business in any twelve (12) month period shall not
exceed the amount purchased for that business from parties other
than Seller over the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding
the acquisition; or
 

(iii)         
that manufactures and supplies Goods, then such Buyer and its
subsidiaries shall continue to procure their requirements for Goods
from Seller pursuant to this Agreement and not (whether in whole or
in part) from such Target.
 

ARTICLE II. 
TERM; TERMINATION
 

2.1         
Term.  This Agreement shall be effective and shall
continue in full force and effect for a term of two (2) years
commencing on the date hereof (the “ Term
”), unless earlier terminated by the Parties in accordance
with Section 2.2 or extended for additional one
(1) year terms by mutual agreement of the Parties.
 

2.2         
Termination.
 

(a)          
Prior to the expiration of the Term, this Agreement may be
terminated:
 

(i)           
by any Party, if any other Party (A) is adjudged bankrupt, or
a general assignment is made for the benefit of creditors, or a
receiver is appointed on account of insolvency or
(B) materially defaults in the performance of any material
provision of this Agreement, including the payment of any sum due
hereunder, and then fails to cure any such default within thirty
(30) days following written notice thereof;
 
4 





 

(ii)          
by either or both Buyers if Seller’s on-time delivery rate to
Buyers for Goods in the aggregate over a 90-day period (which
period shall begin no sooner than February 1, 2016) is less
than 95%, and Seller fails to remedy its on-time delivery rate such
that its on-time delivery rate over the 90-day period following
receipt of notice of a Buyer’s intention to terminate this
Agreement is greater than 95%;
 

(iii)         
by either or both Buyers if Seller’s aggregate expense
(including reimbursements to Buyers in accordance with
Section 7.1(c) ) incurred in repairing under warranty
all natural gas compressors fabricated by Seller over a 90-day
period exceeds (x) 2.5% of  (A) the total sales of
natural gas compressors to the Buyers for the four most recently
completed, non-overlapping 90-day periods divided (B) by four
(or, prior to the first anniversary of this Agreement, each
non-overlapping 90-day period since the date of this Agreement
divided by the number of 90 day periods since the date of this
Agreement), and Seller fails to remedy this average warranty cost
such that its average warranty cost over the 90-day period
following receipt of notice of a Buyer’s intention to
terminate this Agreement is less 2.5% of the average specified
above; or
 

(iv)         
by either or both of the Buyers or Seller in accordance with
Article VI of this Agreement.
 

Any termination under Sections
2.2(a)(i) , (ii)  and (iii)  shall be
considered a “ Termination for Cause
.”
 

(b)          
A Buyer may, with forty-five (45) days’ advance written
notice, cancel an Order for convenience (“ Cancellation
for Convenience ”); provided that such Buyer
shall not be permitted to cancel any Order for Goods scheduled for
completion within forty-five (45) days of such written
notice.  Promptly upon receipt of notice from a Buyer, Seller
shall discontinue all work pertaining to the Goods in accordance
with and to the extent specified in the notice and shall take
commercially reasonable measures to minimize the costs incurred by
such cancellation.
 

(c)          
This Section 2.2(c)  sets forth certain remedies
in addition to any other remedies available to a Buyer or Seller
under this Agreement for a Cancellation for Convenience or a
Termination for Cause by Seller or a Buyer, as the case may
be.  In the event of a Cancellation for Convenience during
which one or more Orders remain pending, the applicable Buyer shall
promptly pay Seller an amount no less than (i) the actual
costs incurred by Seller in connection with each such Order,
including any costs related to the cancellation of the Order and
any of Seller’s subcontracts and any costs expended prior to
the time of cancellation or termination, as applicable, in
connection with the production and development of the Goods, plus
(ii) fifteen percent (15%) of the sum described in clause
(i).  In the event of a Termination for Cause during which one
or more Orders remain pending, the applicable Buyer shall promptly
pay Seller an amount (A) no less than the actual costs
incurred by Seller in connection with each such Order, including
any costs related to the cancellation of the Order and any of
Seller’s subcontracts and any costs expended prior to the
time of cancellation or termination, as applicable, in connection
with the production and development of the Goods divided by
(B) .92.  Upon Seller’s receipt of full payment,
Seller shall, if so directed by the terminating Buyer, ship to such
Buyer at such Buyer’s expense, all Goods subject to the
Cancellation for Convenience or pending during such Termination for
Cause (whether finished or unfinished) for which such Buyer has
made payment.  If the terminating Buyer fails to take
possession of such materials within thirty (30) days of the date of
full payment, including taking possession and storing at the same
location pursuant to the Storage Agreement, Seller shall have the
right to dispose of the Goods as it deems appropriate in its sole
discretion, without further obligation to such Buyer and without in
any way affecting such Buyer’s obligation hereunder. Seller,
may, at its option, consider a Buyer’s written request for
reasonable delays in the delivery of Goods if received before
fabrication of such Goods has commenced.  Notwithstanding any
such request, if fabrication of the Goods

 
5 






 
has commenced or if Seller declines the
applicable Buyer’s delay request, Seller may proceed with
fabrication and completion of the Goods without delay.  If
Seller approves the applicable Buyer’s delay request, such
Buyer, upon Seller’s acceptance of Buyer’s delay
request, accepts the risk of loss for the Goods and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Storage Agreement,
agrees to pay Seller’s reasonable preservation and storage
charges.  If Seller agrees to accept the applicable
Buyer’s delay request with respect to completed Goods, the
applicable Buyer shall execute documentation satisfactory to Seller
memorializing, among other things, the foregoing as well as the
transfer to the applicable Buyer of title to the Goods.
 

(d)          
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties’ remedies in the
event any Order is terminated in accordance with
Article VI of this Agreement will not be governed by
this Section 2.2 and will be as provided
therein.
 

ARTICLE III. 
MANAGEMENT
 

3.1         
Project Managers.  Seller will provide project managers
for the reasonable and customary support and handling of all
Orders. The number of project managers will be determined from time
to time, in Seller’s sole discretion after reasonable notice
to the Buyer, taking into consideration each Buyer’s Forecast
Requirements at the time of such determination. Seller will provide
adequate fabrication, engineering and facility capacity to meet
each Buyer’s requirements for Goods.
 

3.2         
Representatives; Meetings. The Parties agree to hold regular
meetings (at times to be mutually agreed by the Parties) between
each Buyer’s representatives and Seller’s
representatives. Representatives of Seller will provide reasonable
and customary support on the design of the Goods and work with each
Buyer to identify possible efficiencies to optimize the design. In
addition, Seller shall provide Buyers with a written report each
month with respect to Seller’s delivery rate and incurred
warranty costs (as described in Sections 2.2(a)(ii)
 and (iii) ) for the 90-day period preceding the
current calendar month, together with any supporting data that
Buyers may reasonably request to support such report.
 

ARTICLE IV. 
PRICES; TAXES AND FEES
 

4.1         
Prices.
 

(a)          
Reference Prices . Schedule II hereto sets forth the
prices (each such price, as updated in accordance with this
Section 4.1(a) , a “ Reference
Price ”) of certain Goods, which prices shall be in
effect for the first six months of the Term of this Agreement.
Prior to the expiration of each six-month anniversary of the date
of this Agreement, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
determine a revised Reference Price for each Good for which a
Reference Price existed during the prior six-month period. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Major Component vendor
increases its pricing to Seller with respect to a Good for which a
Reference Price exists, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a
revised Reference Price for such affected Good. If no such revised
Reference Price shall be agreed upon pursuant to this
Section 4.1(a)  with respect to a particular Good,
then the price of such Good shall thereafter be determined in
accordance with Section 4.1(b) .
 

(b)          
Cost-Plus Prices .  Except as set forth on Schedule
III , with respect to any Good (i) not set forth on
Schedule II as of the date of this Agreement or
(ii) for which the Reference Price has expired and a new
Reference Price has not been agreed upon in accordance with
Section 4.1(a) , the price

 
6 






 
(the “ Cost-Plus Price
”) of such Good shall equal the total cost of such Good
determined in accordance with Schedule III
hereto.
 

(c)          
Cost-Plus Orders .  For each Order of a Good for which
a Cost-Plus Price applies, Seller shall provide a price form
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
(a “ Price Form ”) to the applicable
Buyer, which will be the basis for estimating the Base Cost of such
Goods and for the estimated Cost-Plus Price reflected in the Order
(the “ Order Price ”). Within sixty (60)
days after delivery of the Goods, Seller shall provide the
applicable Buyer the actual Base Cost and the resulting actual
Cost-Plus Price of the Goods and either credit or bill the
applicable Buyer the difference between the actual Cost-Plus Price
and the Order Price. The Buyer will have a right to audit any
determination of Base Cost submitted by Seller for Goods, which
right shall include the right to reasonably review time records for
engineering services and shop hours, invoices for major equipment
and subcontractors, average inventory costs for stocked materials
and other reasonable documentation as appropriate and not
unreasonably burdensome to Seller.
 

4.2         
Payment.  The terms of payment are net cash in U.S.
dollars via wire transfer to account(s) specified by the
Seller from time to time, according to the agreed payment milestone
schedule on Schedule IV or, if none, on or before
delivery.  If shipment is made in installments, a pro rata
payment shall be due as each shipment is delivered.  Prices
quoted are FCA Seller’s facility (here and throughout this
Agreement, as defined by INCOTERMS 2010) with any shipping and
unloading charges to be paid by the applicable Buyer unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller and such Buyer in the
applicable Order. The prices quoted in the applicable Order do not
include the price of any changes in or to the Goods or any other
costs that may arise from any Change Order accepted by
Seller.
 

4.3         
Taxes and Fees .  All prices are exclusive of any
federal, state or local property, license, privilege, sales, use,
excise, gross receipts or other taxes or fees which may now be or
hereafter become applicable to the Goods or the purchase or sale
thereof or to any services performed in connection therewith, and
all such taxes and fees shall be for the applicable Buyer’s
account. If a Buyer claims a tax exemption with respect to a
purchase under this Agreement, such Buyer must promptly provide
documentation substantiating such exemption in a form and of a
nature satisfactory to Seller and in compliance with applicable
law.  In addition, if a Buyer claims a tax exemption on the
basis of removing the Goods from the state or country of
fabrication, then (A) in the case of Goods to be shipped
outside of the country of fabrication, the documentation
substantiating such exemption shall include (i) a copy of a
bill of lading issued by a licensed and certified carrier of
persons or property that shows Seller as consignor, the Buyer as
consignee and a delivery point outside the territorial limits of
the United States; (ii) documentation that is valid under 34
TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.360 or any successor statute or
regulation (relating to customs brokers) provided by a licensed
customs broker certifying that the Goods will be exported to a
point outside the territorial limits of the United States;
(iii) formal entry documents from the country of destination
showing that the property was imported into a country other than
the United States; or (iv) a copy of the original airway,
ocean or railroad bill of lading issued by a licensed and certified
carrier that describes the Goods being exported and a copy of the
air forwarder’s, ocean forwarder’s or rail freight
forwarder’s receipt if air, oce

	Item 1.01






	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement









	Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement






	On February 22, 2012, Exterran Holdings, Inc. (Exterran or we) entered into a Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement (the Contribution Agreement) with
	Exterran Energy Corp., Exterran General Holdings LLC, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. (EESLP), EES Leasing LLC, EXH GP LP LLC, Exterran GP LLC (GP LLC), EXH MLP LP LLC (MLP LP LLC), Exterran General Partner, L.P.
	(GP), EXLP Operating LLC (EXLP Operating), EXLP Leasing LLC (EXLP Leasing) and Exterran Partners, L.P. (the Partnership). The Contribution Agreement provides for, among others, the following
	transactions:




	1. A series of conveyances, contributions and distributions by EESLP to various parties to the Contribution Agreement and
	ultimately to EXLP Operating and EXLP Leasing of: (a) specified compression services customer contracts and compression equipment used to provide compression services under those contracts, (b) certain other compression equipment currently
	being leased by the Partnership from EESLP and (c) at the election of the conflicts committee of GP LLCs board of directors, a natural gas processing plant with a capacity of 10 million cubic feet per day and a related long-term
	processing services agreement (collectively, the Processing Assets);




	2. The Partnerships issuance of
	1,899,453 common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership, or, at our and the Partnerships mutual election in certain circumstances, the cash equivalent thereof, to MLP LP LLC or its affiliates;




	3. EXLP Operatings assumption and repayment of $105.4 million of our debt; and




	4. If the conflicts committee of GP LLCs board of directors elects to purchase the Processing Assets, the Partnerships payment to us of $33.5 million in cash.




	These transactions, which are subject to standard closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
	period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, are expected to close in March 2012. An additional closing condition requires us and the Partnership to enter into an amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Omnibus
	Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2011 (the Omnibus Agreement), by and among us, EESLP, GP LLC, GP, the Partnership and EXLP Operating, regarding several relationships between us and the Partnership. The Omnibus Agreement is hereby
	incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on August 4, 2011. The description of the Omnibus Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 13,
	2011. The amendment will, among other things, (1) increase the cap on selling, general and administrative costs we allocate to the Partnership based on such costs we incur on the Partnerships behalf and any such costs incurred directly by
	the Partnership and its subsidiaries from $9.0 million per quarter to $10.5 million per quarter and (2) extend the term of the caps on the Partnerships obligation to reimburse us for selling, general and administrative costs and
	operating costs we allocate to the Partnership based on such costs we incur on the Partnerships behalf and any such costs incurred directly by the Partnership and its subsidiaries for an additional year such that the caps will now terminate on
	December 31, 2013. The operations of the natural gas processing plant will not be subject to the cap on operating costs.




	The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Contribution Agreement, a copy of which is filed as
	Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.






	Relationships






	Each of the parties to the Contribution Agreement, other than us, is our direct or indirect subsidiary. As a result, certain individuals,
	including our officers and officers and directors of GP LLC, serve as officers and/or directors of more than one of such entities. Also, we hold (as of the date of this Form 8-K) an indirect 33% limited partner interest in the Partnership
	through our subsidiaries and an approximate 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership through our indirect ownership of GP, the general partner of the Partnership.

















	Item 7.01






	Regulation FD Disclosure







	On February 23, 2012, we announced that we had entered into the Contribution Agreement. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.




	The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be
	filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein
	as being incorporated therein by reference.





	Forward-Looking Statements






	Statements about the consummation of any transaction and all other statements other than historical facts are forward-looking
	statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which
	are outside our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding our ability to complete the proposed transaction and the expected
	timing of the closing of the transaction.






	While we believe that the assumptions concerning future events are
	reasonable, we caution that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of our business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those
	indicated by forward-looking statements are the results of the review of the proposed transaction by regulatory agencies and the failure to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the transaction.






	These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties
	described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and those set forth from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are currently available at www.exterran.com. Except as
	required by law, we expressly disclaim any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

	diligence (including a review of the properties, liabilities, books, records and contracts of MLP) as MLP LP LLC deems adequate.

	Inadvertent Transfers of, or Failure to Transfer, Assets

	ARTICLE VII




	INDEMNIFICATION




	7.1

	Indemnification of the Contributors and Other
	Parties

	. Solely for the purpose of indemnification in this

	Section 7.1

	, the representations and warranties of the Recipients in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or Recipient Material
	Adverse Effect qualifiers. From and after the Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision in the Omnibus Agreement to the contrary, the Recipients shall indemnify and hold the Contributors and their affiliates (other than GP LLC, GP and the
	Recipients and their respective subsidiaries), equity holders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and insurers (together with the Contributors, the 

	Contributor Parties

	) harmless from and against any and all
	damages (including exemplary damages and penalties), losses, deficiencies, costs, expenses, obligations, fines, expenditures, claims and liabilities, including reasonable counsel fees and reasonable expenses of investigation, defending and
	prosecuting litigation (collectively, the 

	Damages

	), suffered by the Contributor Parties as a




	 




	-15-








	result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of any Recipient in this Agreement, (b) any breach of any agreement or
	covenant under this Agreement on the part of any Recipient or (c) the ownership, operation or conduct of the Businesses or the Assets on or after the Closing Date, other than those for which the Recipients may be indemnified by the Contributors
	hereunder.




	7.2

	Indemnification of the Recipients and other Parties

	. Solely for the purpose of indemnification in this

	Section 7.2

	, the representations and warranties of the Contributors in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. From and after the Closing Date, and
	notwithstanding any provision in the Omnibus Agreement to the contrary, the Contributors shall indemnify and hold GP LLC, GP and the Recipients and their respective subsidiaries, equity holders (other than LP LLC, MLP LP LLC and any of the
	Contributor Parties), directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and insurers (together with the Recipients, the 

	Recipient Parties

	) harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered by the Recipient Parties as a
	result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of any Contributor in this Agreement, (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant under this Agreement on the part of any
	Contributor or (c) the ownership, operation or conduct of the Business or the Assets prior to the Closing Date.




	7.3

	Demands

	. Each indemnified party agrees that promptly upon its discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim, action or
	proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such third party actions being collectively referred to herein as the 

	Indemnity Claim

	), with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the
	provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party, together with a statement of such information respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a formal demand for
	indemnification under this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall not be obligated to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to any Indemnity Claim if the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party thereof in
	accordance with the provisions of this Agreement to the extent that knowing failure to notify actually results in material prejudice or damage to the indemnifying party.




	7.4

	Right to Contest and Defend

	. The indemnifying party shall be entitled at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim with respect to
	which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement;

	provided

	, that notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party within 20 days from
	the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying party or the indemnified party as may be
	appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted and prosecuted diligently to a final conclusion or settled in accordance with this

	Section 7.4

	by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not




	 




	-16-








	reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its
	own choosing at its sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken with respect thereto;

	provided

	, however, that the indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the
	indemnified party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense. If the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim or elects to contest
	such Indemnity Claim but fails diligently and promptly to prosecute or settle such claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall have assumed the
	defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount
	of the liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party.




	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be
	liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against
	the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Indemnity Claim
	can be so separated from that for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.




	7.5

	Cooperation

	. If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim that the
	indemnifying party elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any
	expenses incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.




	7.6

	Right to Participate

	. The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel the opportunity to be
	present at, and to participate in, conferences with all persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or counsel for such persons.




	7.7

	Payment of Damages

	. The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the
	course of the investigation or defense, within 10 days as and when reasonably




	 




	-17-








	specific bills are received or loss, liability, claim, damage or expense is incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered. In calculating any amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by
	reason of the provisions of this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all tax benefits and other reimbursements (including, without limitation, insurance proceeds) credited to or received by the other party related to the Damages.




	7.8

	Limitations on Indemnification

	.




	(a) To the extent the Recipient Parties are entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to

	Section 7.2(a)

	or

	(b)

	provided

	, that the Contributors shall not be liable for Damages that exceed, in the aggregate, $15.1

	Section 1.5

	shall be made, the term

	ARTICLE IX




	MISCELLANEOUS




	9.1

	Transfer Restrictions

	. For a 180-day period beginning
	on the Closing Date, neither the New Common Units nor any interest therein shall be transferable by MLP LP LLC without the prior written consent of MLP, except for transfers to affiliated entities of the Contributors in compliance with the
	provisions of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. MLP shall require (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to MLP) any proposed permitted transferee of any such New Common Units or any interest therein to be
	acquired from MLP LP LLC to agree to take and hold such New Common Units or any interest therein subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified in this

	Section 9.1

	. Any transfer of those New Common Units or any interest
	therein otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be null and void.




	9.2

	Registration Rights of
	MLP LP LLC and its Affiliates

	.




	(a) If (i) MLP LP LLC or any affiliate of MLP LP LLC (including for purposes of this

	Section 9.2

	, any affiliate of MLP LP LLC as of the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later cease to be an affiliate of MLP LP LLC) desires to sell New Common Units and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule
	or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such holder of New Common Units (the 

	Holder

	) to dispose of the number of New Common Units it desires to sell at the time it desires to do
	so without registration under the Securities Act, then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, MLP shall file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	Commission

	) as promptly as practicable after
	receiving such request, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all New Common
	Units covered by such registration statement have been sold, a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the number of New Common Units specified by the Holder;

	provided

	, however, that MLP shall not
	be required to effect more than three registrations pursuant to this

	Section 9.2(a)

	and

	Section 9.2(b)

	; and

	provided

	further, however, that if the Conflicts Committee determines that the requested registration would be
	materially detrimental to MLP or the limited partners of MLP (other than EESLP and its subsidiaries) because such registration would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving
	MLP, (y) require premature disclosure of material information that MLP has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render MLP unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then MLP shall
	have the right to postpone such requested registration for a period of not more than three months after receipt of the Holders request, such right pursuant to this

	Section 9.2(a)

	or

	Section 9.2(b)

	not to be utilized
	more than twice in any 12-month period. In connection with any registration pursuant to the first sentence of this

	Section 9.2(a)

	, MLP shall (i) promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to register or
	qualify the securities subject to such registration under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request;

	provided

	, however, that no such qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
	thereof, MLP would become subject to general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration, and (B) such
	documents as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the New Common Units subject to such registration on a national securities exchange as the Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii) use commercially reasonable




	 




	-21-








	efforts to do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of such New Common Units in such states. Except as set forth
	in

	Section 9.2(d)

	, all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions and excluding the legal fees and other expenses incurred by the Holder) shall be paid by MLP, without
	reimbursement by the Holder.




	(b) If any Holder holds New Common Units that it desires to sell and Rule 144 of the Securities
	Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such Holder to dispose of the number of New Common Units it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration
	under the Securities Act, then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, MLP shall file with the Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain
	effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all New Common Units covered by a shelf registration statement have been sold, a shelf registration statement
	covering the New Common Units specified by the Holder on an appropriate form under Rule 415 under the Securities Act, or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission;

	provided

	, however, that MLP shall not be required to effect more
	than three registrations pursuant to

	Section 9.2(a)

	and this

	Section 9.2(b)

	; and

	provided

	further, however, that if the Conflicts Committee determines in good faith that any offering under, or the use of any prospectus
	forming a part of, the shelf registration statement would be materially detrimental to MLP and its Partners because such offering or use would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction
	involving MLP, (y) require premature disclosure of material information that MLP has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render MLP unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then
	MLP shall have the right to suspend such offering or use for a period of not more than three months after receipt of the Holders request, such right pursuant to

	Section 9.2(a)

	or this

	Section 9.2(b)

	not to be utilized
	more than twice in any 12-month period.




	(c) Except as provided in the first sentence of each of subsections (a) and
	(b) of this

	Section 9.2

	, MLP shall be deemed not to have used all reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement effective during the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of New
	Common Units covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such New Common Units at any time during such period, unless such action is required by applicable law.




	(d) If MLP shall at any time propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of MLP for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee
	benefit plan), MLP shall use all reasonable efforts to provide the Holders notice of its intention to file such registration statement and shall use all reasonable efforts to include such number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such
	registration statement as the Holder shall request;

	provided

	, that MLP is not required to make any effort or take any action to so include the securities of the Holder once the registration statement is declared effective by the Commission or
	otherwise becomes effective, including any registration statement providing for the offering from time to time of securities pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act. If the proposed offering pursuant to this

	Section 9.2(d)

	shall be an
	underwritten offering, then, if the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering advise MLP and the Holder in




	 




	-22-








	writing that in their opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holders New Common Units would adversely and materially affect the success of the offering, MLP shall include in such
	offering only that number or amount, if any, of securities held by the Holder that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, will not adversely and materially affect the offering. All costs and expenses of any such
	registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions and excluding the legal fees and other expenses incurred by the Holder) shall be paid by MLP, without reimbursement by the Holder.




	(e) The provisions of

	Section 9.2(a)

	,

	Section 9.2(b)

	and

	Section 9.2(d)

	shall continue to be
	applicable with respect to MLP LP LLC (and any of MLP LP LLCs affiliates) after GP ceases to be a general partner of MLP, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required
	for the Holder to sell all of the New Common Units with respect to which it has requested during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise filed or that a registration statement be filed;

	provided

	, however, that MLP
	shall not be required to file successive registration statements covering the same New Common Units for which registration was demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of

	Section 9.2(d)

	shall continue in effect thereafter.




	(f) The rights to cause MLP to register New Common Units pursuant to this

	Section 9.2

	may be assigned (but only
	with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such New Common Units if (i) MLP is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and
	the number of New Common Units with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms set forth in this

	Section 9.2

	.




	(g) Any request to register New Common Units pursuant to this

	Section 9.2

	shall (i) specify the New Common
	Units intended to be offered and sold by the person making the request, (ii) express such persons present intent to offer such New Common Units for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale of
	New Common Units, and (iv) contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such information and materials and take all action as may be required in order to permit MLP to comply with all applicable requirements in connection with the
	registration of such New Common Units.




	9.3

	Expenses

	. Except as otherwise set forth herein, each party hereto shall pay
	its own expenses incident to this Agreement and all action taken in preparation for effecting the provisions of this Agreement.




	9.4

	Right of Offset

	. Each party agrees that, in addition to, and without limitation of, any right of set-off, lien or counterclaim
	a party may otherwise have, each party shall have the right and be entitled, at its option, to offset (a) balances held by it or by any of its affiliates for account of any other party at any of its offices and (b) other obligations at any
	time owing by such party in connection with any obligations to or for the credit or account of the other party, against any principal of or interest on any of such other partys indebtedness or any other amount due and payable to such other
	party hereunder that is not paid when due.

	EXTERRAN PARTNERS AGREES TO ACQUIRE






	COMPRESSION AND PROCESSING ASSETS FROM EXTERRAN HOLDINGS





	HOUSTON (Feb. 23, 2012) 
	Exterran Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EXH) and Exterran Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: EXLP) today announced that Exterran Partners has agreed to acquire compression and processing assets from Exterran Holdings for consideration valued at approximately $184
	million.




	Assets to be acquired by Exterran Partners include:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Compression services. Contracts serving approximately 40 customers of Exterran Holdings and its affiliates, together with approximately 400 compressor
	units used to provide compression services under those contracts, comprising approximately 188,000 horsepower and representing approximately 5 percent (by available horsepower) of the combined U.S. contract operations business of Exterran Holdings
	and Exterran Partners. In addition, the acquisition includes approximately 140 compressor units comprising approximately 75,000 horsepower currently being leased from Exterran Holdings to Exterran Partners.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Processing services. A natural gas processing plant with a capacity of 10 million cubic feet per day located in the northeastern United States
	used to provide processing services pursuant to a long-term services agreement.







	We are pleased with this transaction,
	which will expand Exterran Partners fee-based business and enhance its leading market position as a provider of natural gas contract operations services in the United States. The acquisition will increase Exterran Partners contract
	operations fleet to approximately 2.1 million horsepower, which would comprise approximately 58 percent by available horsepower of the combined U.S. contract operations business of Exterran Holdings and Exterran Partners, said Brad
	Childers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Exterran Partners managing general partner.

	of 3










	Exterran Holdings expects to benefit from its continued ownership in Exterran Partners and expects to
	continue to offer the balance of its U.S. contract operations business to Exterran Partners over time. Exterran Holdings expects to use a portion of the transaction proceeds to enhance its capital position through the reduction of debt at the
	Exterran parent level, added Mr. Childers, President and Chief Executive Officer of Exterran Holdings.




	In connection with and upon
	the closing of the transaction, the omnibus agreement between Exterran Partners and Exterran Holdings will be amended to reflect adjustments in the cap on selling, general and administrative costs from $9.0 million per quarter to
	$10.5 million per quarter, while the cap on operating costs will remain at $21.75 per horsepower per quarter. These caps will be extended for one year and will now terminate on December 31, 2013, unless otherwise extended.




	The board of directors of the managing general partner of Exterran Partners approved the transaction based on a recommendation from its conflicts
	committee. The conflicts committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, retained independent legal and financial advisors to assist it in evaluating the transaction.




	The transaction consideration will include the delivery to Exterran Holdings of approximately 1.9 million common units of Exterran Partners, or the cash equivalent thereof, and Exterran
	Partners assumption of a portion of Exterran Holdings indebtedness. In conjunction with the transaction, Exterran Partners is currently in the process of amending its revolving credit facility to increase its size by an additional $200
	million, which it expects to complete prior to the closing of the acquisition. Exterran Partners expects to finance the transaction and continue to finance its business in a manner consistent with its current and target capital structure

	.

	The
	transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions and is expected to close prior to the end of the first quarter.

	Forward-Looking Statements




	All statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the subjects of this release) other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside the control of Exterran
	Holdings and Exterran Partners (the Companies), which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to: the Companies operational and financial
	strategies and ability to successfully effect those strategies; Exterran Partners expectations regarding the financing of the transaction contemplated by this release, Exterran Partners statements related to the expected amendment to its
	revolving credit facility and the expected timing thereof; the Companies financial and operational outlook and ability to fulfill that outlook; Exterran Holdings intention to continue to offer the balance of its U.S. contract operations
	business to Exterran Partners; statements relating to Exterran Holdings expected use of proceeds from the transaction; statements regarding the expected benefits of the transaction to Exterran Holdings and Exterran Partners; and statements
	regarding the ability of the Companies to complete their proposed transaction and the expected timing of the closing of the transaction.




	While the Companies believe that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, they caution that there are inherent difficulties in predicting
	certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of their business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are: changes in the capital and
	financial markets that impact the effect of the drop-down of additional assets to Exterran Partners; local, regional, national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on the Companies and their customers; changes in tax
	laws that impact master limited partnerships; conditions in the oil and gas industry, including a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for oil or natural gas or a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas; Exterran
	Holdings ability to timely and cost-effectively execute larger projects; changes in political or economic conditions in key operating markets, including international markets; changes in safety, health, environmental and other regulations; as
	to each of the Companies, the performance of the other entity; the results of the review of the proposed transaction by regulatory agencies; and the failure to satisfy various other conditions to the closing of the transaction and the amendment to
	Exterran Partners revolving credit facility.




	These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking
	statements and challenges and uncertainties described in Exterran Holdings Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Exterran Partners Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and
	those set forth from time to time in the Companies filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are currently available at

	www.exterran.com

	. Except as required by law, the Companies expressly disclaim any intention or
	obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
