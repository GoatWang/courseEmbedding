--Transaction forms combined NASDAQ-listed biopharmaceutical company, focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) and diabetic macular edema (DME) --KalVista to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Carbylan, and KalVista shareholders to become majority owners of Carbylan upon the closing of the transaction  PALO ALTO, Calif. and SALISBURY, United Kingdom, June  15, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbylan Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CBYL) and KalVista Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a privately-held biopharmaceutical company, announced today that they, together with the shareholders of KalVista, have entered into a definitive share purchase agreement pursuant to which the shareholders of KalVista will become the majority owners of Carbylan.  If approved, Carbylan will be renamed KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.  Carbylan’s three largest shareholders, InterWest Partners, Alta Partners and Vivo Capital, who hold approximately 50% of Carbylan’s voting shares, have entered into agreements in support of the proposed transaction.  KalVista’s existing shareholders, which have unanimously agreed to the proposed transaction, include Longwood Fund, Novo A/S, RA Capital Management, SV Life Sciences and Venrock.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of Carbylan.  David Renzi, President and CEO of Carbylan stated:  "Following an extensive and thorough review of strategic alternatives, we concluded that the transaction with KalVista provides Carbylan stockholders a meaningful equity ownership stake and an attractive opportunity for value appreciation in a biopharmaceutical company with promising clinical assets and substantial upside potential.  We are optimistic that KalVista’s pipeline and strong leadership team, together with the combined company’s cash resources, will enable the company to reach significant milestones in KalVista’s pipeline."    Andrew Crockett, KalVista’s CEO said:  “This transaction allows us to continue the development of our potentially best-in-class plasma kallikrein inhibitor platform, and rapidly advance our programs in HAE and DME, bringing much-needed treatments to patients.  We are in a very strong position to drive the growth of the combined company, and achieve the full potential of our therapeutic pipeline.” Upon the closing of the transaction, the executive officers of KalVista will assume their respective positions at the combined company, and the executive officers of Carbylan will resign.  The Board of Directors of the combined company will include two members designated by Carbylan prior to the closing of the transaction. KalVista shareholders will receive newly issued shares of common stock of Carbylan in connection with the transaction contemplated by the share purchase agreement.  Upon the closing of the transaction, existing KalVista equityholders are expected to own approximately 81% of the combined company, and existing Carbylan stockholders are expected to own approximately 19% of the combined company, each on a fully-diluted basis.  The percentage of the combined company that KalVista equityholders will own as of the closing of the transaction is subject to adjustment based on the amount of Carbylan’s net cash at closing date.  The share purchase agreement contains further details with respect to this adjustment and the transaction. The proposed transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The total cash balance, net of debt and expected transaction costs, of the combined company upon the closing of the proposed transaction is expected to be between $35 and $40 million, which is expected to be sufficient to allow the combined company to achieve meaningful clinical data. Carbylan was advised in the proposed transaction by Wedbush PacGrow and KalVista was advised by Jefferies LLC.  Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to Carbylan and Fenwick & West LLP and Cooley LLP served as legal counsel to KalVista. Conference Call InformationCarbylan and KalVista will host a conference call during the week commencing June 20th to discuss the proposed transaction.  Call in information will be provided in a future press release. About KalVistaKalVista is a pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet needs.  KalVista has developed a proprietary portfolio of small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors targeting hereditary angioedema (HAE) and diabetic macular edema (DME).  The Company’s portfolio of orally delivered plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE is expected to commence Phase 1 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016.  KalVista’s most advanced program, an intravitreally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitor for DME, has successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials in DME patients and is being prepared for a Phase 2 clinical trial. The Company has raised capital from international life science investors.  In addition, its development programs have received grant support from the JDRF, Innovate UK, and the European Commission. www.KalVista.com About CarbylanCarbylan Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company.  Carbylan’s initial focus was on the development of Hydros-TA, its proprietary, potentially best-in-class intra-articular injectable product candidate to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.  Carbylan was incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 26, 2004 as Sentrx Surgical, Inc.  Carbylan’s name was changed to Carbylan Biosurgery, Inc. on December 14, 2005 and again to Carbylan Therapeutics, Inc. on March 7, 2014. Since commencing operations in 2004, Carbylan has devoted substantially all of its efforts to identifying and developing product candidates for therapeutic markets, recruiting personnel and raising capital.  Carbylan has devoted predominantly all of its resources to the preclinical and clinical development of, and manufacturing capabilities for, Hydros-TA. In February 2016, Carbylan announced topline results of COR1.1 trial, a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing treatment with Hydros-TA to treatment with Hydros and with TA, on a standalone basis.  Hydros-TA met the first of its two primary endpoints but did not meet its second primary endpoint. In April 2016, Carbylan announced that it had suspended further clinical development of Hydros-TA.

To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.
BusinessCBYL is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel and proprietary combination therapies that address significant unmet medical needs.

CBYL's initial focus is on the development of Hydros-TA, its proprietary, potentially best-in-class intra-articular, or IA, injectable product candidate to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee.
US expectationsUpon FDA approval, CBYL expects to commercialize Hydros-TA for OA pain in the knee in the United States with an approximately 50 to 100 person specialty sales force targeting orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists and pain specialists.
Hydros-TACurrent joint injection, or intra-articular, treatments for OA pain include corticosteroids, commonly known as steroids, which provide short-term relief, and viscosupplements, which provide pain relief over the longer-term.
In contrast, Hydros-TA utilizes CBYL's proprietary cross-linking technology to deliver both rapid pain relief with a low dose steroid triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, and sustained pain relief with CBYL's proprietary hyaluronic acid viscosupplement.
Hydros-TA is a combination IA product designed to provide both rapid and sustained pain relief.
CBYL believes the low dose steroid component of Hydros-TA will provide rapid pain relief as well as sustained pain relief up to six months, from CBYL's proprietary hyaluronic acid component.
Hydros-TA is currently being studied in a Phase 3 trial, referred to as COR1.1.
CBYL expects to initiate a second Phase 3 trial, referred to as COR1.2, to open an investigational new drug application, or IND, and begin enrolling U.S. patients in mid-2015.
CBYL anticipates reporting top-line results from COR1.1 and COR1.2 by the end of 2015 and 2016, respectively, and submitting the NDA for Hydros-TA in early 2017.
Technology license agreementIn November 2012, CBYL entered into a technology license agreement with Shanghai Jingfeng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Jingfeng, where CBYL granted to Jingfeng an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Hydros-TA in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
In consideration for the exclusive license, CBYL received a non-refundable up-front payment of $2.0 million ($1.7 million net of Chinese withholding tax).

Additionally, CBYL is eligible to receive future regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.5 million, which are considered non-substantive milestones for accounting purposes, and commercialization royalty payments of up to approximately $5.0 million (each excluding Chinese withholding tax).
Other than the arrangement with Jingfeng, CBYL owns global development and commercialization rights to Hydros-TA.
Clinical trialsIn CBYL's Phase 2b study of 98 patients, though not designed to show statistical significance, Hydros-TA demonstrated better pain reduction at all time points measured than Synvisc-One, the U.S. market-leading viscosupplement.
CBYL is currently studying Hydros-TA in an international Phase 3 trial enrolling up to 510 patients, and CBYL expects to open an investigational new drug application, or IND, and begin to enroll U.S. patients in its second Phase 3 trial in mid-2015.
Joint disorderOA is a joint disorder involving the degradation of the IA cartilage, joint lining, ligaments and, ultimately, underlying bone.
OA results in inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage.
Symptoms of this disease include pain, stiffness, swelling and limitation in the function of the joint.
There is no known way to reverse the progression of OA and while there are a number of therapeutic options to treat the pain associated with OA, even with treatment, the disease typically continues to progress and patients may eventually require joint replacement surgery, often referred to as total knee arthroplasty, or TKA.
Relative to therapeutic options to treat the pain, TKA is very expensive, with a cost of approximately $33,000 to $40,000 for an initial surgery and $74,000 for a revision surgery, thereby resulting in a meaningful burden on the healthcare system.
OA severity is generally graded on a scale from one to four.
When OA advances and oral or topical drug treatments are not sufficient to effectively address the associated pain, physicians often turn to IA treatments, such as steroids, and hyaluronic acid, or HA, viscosupplements.

While steroid injections can provide rapid pain relief, they generally provide only short-term pain relief of two to four weeks post injection.
On the other hand, while HA injections can often provide long-term pain relief of up to approximately six months, they do not generally begin to provide peak pain relief until five weeks post injection.
As a result, CBYL believes there is a significant unmet medical need for a single product that provides both rapid and sustained pain relief in a safe and effective manner.
Intellectual propertyIn November 2012, CBYL entered into a technology license agreement with Jingfeng, pursuant to which CBYL granted Jingfeng the exclusive right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Hydros-TA, or any improvements or modifications of Hydros-TA, for human and veterinary uses in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
In these countries, Jingfeng is responsible for the manufacture and supply of Hydros-TA, the management and funding of all development activities, regulatory submissions and regulatory approvals for Hydros-TA, and the commercialization of Hydros-TA.
Jingfeng is restricted from developing, manufacturing, using, distributing, marketing, importing and selling Hydros-TA outside of the foregoing territories.
As of January 1, 2015, CBYL is the owner of record of four issued or allowed U.S. patents and eight issued or allowed non-U.S. patents, and CBYL is actively pursuing an additional two U.S. patent applications and 17 non-U.S. patent applications.
CBYL also relies on trade secrets and careful monitoring of its proprietary information to protect aspects of its business that are not amenable to, or that CBYL does not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
CompetitionThe key competitive factors affecting the success of Hydros-TA, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
CBYL believes it will compete favorably by having a fast-acting, long lasting, effective candidate that has a validated mechanism of action for OA pain relief and an attractive safety profile.

Intra-articular TherapiesCurrently available steroid injections are effective at providing pain relief within a couple of days, but they do not last for more than about a month and can have a damaging effect on the healthy cartilage.
Most of these steroid injections are interchangeable with the choice usually stemming from cost to the patient and physician preference.
Specifically, Flexion Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FLXN) is developing FX006 which is a time release steroid composed of triamcinolone acetonide encapsulated in PGLA particles providing pain relief of up to approximately 10 weeks post injection.
There are five multi-injection viscosupplements (Hyalgan, Orthovisc, Supartz, Synvisc and Euflexxa) and three single-injection products (Synvisc-One, Gel-One and Monovisc) that are currently on the market.
Each of these products is derived from HA, which generally does not begin to provide peak pain relief until five weeks post injection.
Combination and Other Therapies A combination of viscosupplementation and corticosteroid is also being evaluated by Anika Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ANIK).
The Anika product, called Cingal, is a combination of hyaluronic acid (Monovisc) and triamcinolone hexacetonide (TH) providing pain relief of up to approximately 12 weeks post injection.
This product was recently evaluated in a three arm trial comparing Monovisc and Cingal to placebo.
To CBYL's knowledge, the study results have not yet been released to the public, and this is the first human trial with this product. Ampio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMPE) is developing an injectable treatment for OA knee pain called Ampion.
Ampion is comprised of aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine, an endogenous immunomodulatory molecule derived from the N-terminus of human serum albumin. To CBYL's knowledge, Ampion is currently under evaluation in a Phase 3 trial.

DividendsNo dividends are planned.
Use of proceedsCBYL expects to receive $67 million from its IPO and use it for the following:
$25.0 million to $35.0 million to fund its continued research and discovery efforts, including to fund to completion both its ongoing COR1.1 and its future COR1.2 Phase 3 clinical trials of Hydros-TA in support of an NDA filing with the FDA;
the remainder for working capital and other corporate purposes, which may include the pursuit of other research and discovery efforts, including the development of Hydros-TA for the treatment of OA pain in other joints in the body.
CBYL may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay its secured debt facility with Silicon Valley Bank, under which CBYL owes approximately $4.5 million in principal and interest as of September 30, 2014.

Carbylan BioSurgery, Inc. Announces Appointment of President and CEO 
      to Lead Company Through Next Phase of Development






July 16, 2013 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Carbylan 
      BioSurgery, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on the development 
      and commercialization of advanced biomaterial-based joint therapies to 
      treat pain associated with osteoarthritis, announced that it has 
      appointed David M. Renzi as president, chief executive officer and 
      member of the board of directors. The appointment of Mr. Renzi, a proven 
      operational executive, signals a renewed focus on the Company’s 
      long-term growth strategy and a dedication to product development and 
      commercialization. The Company also announced that Samuel Lynch, D.M.D., 
      D.M.Sc. has been appointed chairman of Carbylan’s board of directors.
    


      Commenting on Mr. Renzi’s appointment, Dr. Lynch stated, “Given David’s 
      extensive experience in both public and private medical device 
      companies, the board of directors is delighted that he has joined 
      Carbylan as we continue the development process of the Company’s next 
      generation injectable technology for the treatment of joint pain.” Mr. 
      Renzi will lead Carbylan as it enters its pivotal clinical trial 
      utilizing the Company’s proprietary hyaluronan-based hydrogel which is 
      combined with a low dose corticosteroid. This unique technology is 
      designed to provide rapid and long-lasting relief of the pain associated 
      with osteoarthritis using a single intra-articular injection.
    

      Mr. Renzi has over 30 years of successful healthcare experience and 
      spent the majority of this time with Ethicon and Ethicon Endosurgery, 
      divisions of Johnson & Johnson. There he was given responsibility for 
      numerous business disciplines including sales, sales management, 
      marketing management and new procedure development. Most recently, Mr. 
      Renzi was president and chief executive officer of Neomend, Inc., a 
      company developing and commercializing hydrogels and surgical sealants 
      for treating lung air leaks after surgical resection. Neomend was 
      purchased by C.R. Bard in October 2012. Prior to Neomend, Mr. Renzi was 
      executive vice president and chief commercial officer of Novacept, Inc. 
      and SurgRx, Inc., both privately held venture-backed companies with 
      successful exits in 2004 and 2008, respectively.
    

      “I am extremely excited to join the Carbylan team as we continue our 
      development of a next generation injectable aimed at capturing 
      significant share in the $2.5 billion viscosupplementation market. This 
      market is growing by over 11 percent per year and there are nearly 27 
      million people in the United States alone who suffer from 
      osteoarthritis. I am confident our technology will continue to produce 
      meaningful clinical data as we advance our pivotal trial later this 
      year. This clinically relevant pivotal trial data, coupled with results 
      from our successful recent phase IIb study, I believe will allow us to 
      gain regulatory approval and ultimately provide this unique therapy to 
      the many patients still suffering from the pain of osteoarthritis,” said 
      Mr. Renzi. “There are many exciting and promising opportunities before 
      us, and I am very pleased to be involved with Carbylan at this important 
      phase in the Company’s development cycle.”
    

      “David's significant expertise in growing biotechnology companies into 
      industry leaders will be critical as we work to move Carbylan’s products 
      through clinical trials, regulatory approval and ultimately 
      commercialization," continued Dr. Lynch. "The Company’s platform 
      technology provides an innovative, proprietary means of addressing a 
      substantial unmet medical need. David will help us realize our vision 
      for the organization and future growth plans for our technology."
    

      Dr. Lynch founded BioMimetic Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company 
      specializing in the development and commercialization of products to 
      promote the healing of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases in 
      orthopedic and sports medicine applications, and served as president, 
      chief executive officer and a director for more than 10 years. He also 
      served as chairman of the board of directors until the company’s initial 
      public offering (IPO). At BioMimetic, Dr. Lynch oversaw the company’s 
      financings, including an IPO and follow-on financings as well as its 
      recent merger with Wright Medical Group, Inc. He also brings additional 
      expertise in product development and regulatory affairs to the Carbylan 
      board.
