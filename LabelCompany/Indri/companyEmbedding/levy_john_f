Board Advisory:Corporate Governance, Financial Reportingand Financial Strategies for Growing Businesses
“Trust is really the central issue. What keeps our society running is trust. You drive through an intersection with a green light because you trust that other drivers stop at the red light. Without that trust we couldn't drive. If you couldn't trust pilots and airlines, you wouldn't fly.When you can't trust companies and/or markets, you don't become a shareholder. Returning to ethical behavior rebuilds trust. And right now, rebuilding trust is the most important thing we need to do. Trust in each other. Trust in our businesses. ”
