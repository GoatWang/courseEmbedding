WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







I was looking everywhere with no luck for an important research publication called World Retail Data

                         & Statistics 2014. Eventually, I gave up but found a 2012 edition of the same publication at Research and Markets. I then emailed customer support to see if they could get me the 2014 edition and within hours, I had the 2014 edition - even at no additional charge.Wow, that was truly impressive customer service by you guys.Thanks a ton to Research and Markets.

What is an online bank?
Online banks offer higher interest rates. Most do not have physical branches, passing the savings on to you! As long as you live in the USA, you can sign up with an online bank. Interact with your bank from anywhere using your computer, smart phone, or tablet.


Why should I change banks?
Think of an online savings account as gaining another—better—bank account. You're not losing or changing, you're gaining the benefits of an online bank while keeping the benefits of a local bank.
BENEFITS: high yield interest rates, modern apps, easy funding, and more!


What is FDIC protection?
The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is a US government corporation that insures the money in your accounts up to $250,000. This doesn't cost you anything!
All of the banks on our list are FDIC insured. This means there's no risk, unless you invest more than $250,000 with each bank.

360 Money MarketÂ®: 1.10% APY for Balances $10K+ - Open Now







National Average Interest Rate
The National average is only 0.06%.
Online banks have a lower operating cost, larger area of influence, and can offer a more competitive interest rate. This rate is currently up to
20.8 times higher than the national average!


1.25% doesn't seem that high, is it worth it?
Absolutely! It may not seem that much, though with $2,000 in the bank for emergencies or other savings, you'll earn $25.00 a year. For a 15 minute investment, that's making the equivalent of
$100.00 an hour. Your money will now work for you forever. Invest more and the return just gets better.


Online Savings vs CD Account
High Yield Savings often pays equal to low-term CD (certificate of deposit) accounts. And, you have much more flexibility with your money. With a CD, you can't touch your money without penalty for the agreed term. That's not true with an online savings account.
