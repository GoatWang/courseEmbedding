2ND SKULL® Protective Headgear Introduces Pro Athletes and New Product Innovation



Share Article






















2ND SKULL® introduces Meghan Klingenberg, Francisco Cervelli, Brian Quick and announces new product innovation in time for upcoming Football and Soccer seasons.







Brian Quick, Meghan Klingenberg and Francisco Cervelli

“We know that athletes want to look and feel great when they take the field. This is what we focus on, delivering great looking protection.


Pittsburgh, PA (PRWEB)
May 26, 2016
 The introduction of our professional athletes coincides with the company’s new campaign: “LOOK LIKE THE PROS WHILE ADDING PROTECTION TO YOUR HEAD ™”.  
“We are proud to introduce Meghan Klingenberg, defender and World Champion with the US Women’s National Soccer Team. On the football front we have Brian Quick, wide receiver for Los Angeles who was a second round selection in the 2012 NFL draft. We are also thrilled to introduce Francisco Cervelli, a premiere catcher for MLB who plays for Pittsburgh. Our athletes personify values that align with ours. The passion they exemplify on the field as well as the generosity off the field were critical in our selection.
"The 2ND SKULL® Cap is a protective skull cap that looks just like the one that Cam Newton wore on Super Bowl 50. 2ND SKULL® products enhance these by having a thin, soft, flexible and breathable layer of protective material that delivers impact protection. The special urethane molecules are soft at rest but harden upon impact, absorbing the energy” - said Federico Olivares, CEO of 2nd Skull, LLC.
The Pittsburgh based protective headgear company has a product for every sport. The 2ND SKULL® Cap is a protective skull cap for any sports helmet that delivers unmatched value for athletes as it can be worn throughout the year in multiple sports. The 2ND SKULL® Cap is permitted for use at the High School level for football, hockey, baseball and lacrosse. For non-helmet sports like soccer, basketball or women’s lacrosse, the company created the 2ND SKULL® Band, a protective headband that can also be used in multiple sports.
The new 2ND SKULL® products feature a Digital Camouflage 2ND SKULL® Cap and an improved 4mm 2ND SKULL® Band. The new 4mm 2ND SKULL® Band complies with FIFA Law 4 and offers more protection than the first generation of headbands. The new items feature Impact Absorption Technology, compressive fit, moisture wicking fabrics for sweat management, and antimicrobial treatment for anti-odor.
“We know that athletes want to look and feel great when they take the field. This is what we focus on, delivering great looking protection. Our new products excel on this. The best protection is the one that is worn. We know that there are other protective options out there, but athletes will not wear them because they look weird or are bulky. The “LOOK LIKE THE PROS WHILE ADDING PROTECTION TO YOUR HEAD ™” campaign simplifies the message and will position the 2ND SKULL® brand in a differentiated manner.”
The new products are now available at 2ndSkull.com and will be reaching several sporting goods retailers in the summer. The retail price of the 2ND SKULL® Cap is $59.99 while the retail price of the 2ND SKULL® Band is $49.99. Our products are available in different sizes so that athletes of all ages can have additional protection. More information at 2ndskull.com.

PROTECTION PLAN






Protection Plan













Protection and Extended Service Plans
Many products sold through DICKS.com come with a manufacturer's warranty. Customers seeking information about a product's manufacturer's warranty should directly contact the manufacturer.
For certain items, DICKS.com offers an Extended Service Plan, giving you the option to receive up to four years of additional protection against product breakdowns, including mechanical or electrical failure caused by faulty workmanship.
Our Extended Service Plan begins when the manufacturer's warranty expires. Click here for Terms and Conditions. The Extended Service Plan is not offered in Maine due to state law.
Plan Benefits:

Choose from one to four years of additional coverage
Coverage begins after manufacturer warranty expires
It's a no-lemon policy: If a product breaks down for the same reason three times during the coverage, the product will be replaced for free. No hidden fees. No deductibles
Full coverage of parts and labor for repairs from defects or faulty workmanship for products over $100. If your product is not fixed you will receive full replacement cost
Full coverage of parts and labor for repairs from defects or faulty workmanship for products over $100. If your product is not fixed you will receive full replacement cost
Access to more than 12,000 customer service centers nationwide
Up to $45 for installation, removal or reinstallation costs

How to purchase:

Extended Service Plan options are available for eligible products under a drop down menu on the product page. Coverage is not available for all products
Select a plan from the drop down menu and click "Add to Cart"
Your selected coverage is shown on the Shopping Cart screen and coverage selections can be changed
When finished shopping, click "Proceed to Checkout" and complete your purchase
Once your product ships you will be mailed the terms and conditions for your plan. For more information about the plans or to submit a service request, contact NEW at 1.866.633.2419.

The plan will only be available at the time of purchase and is not sold separately.

If you would like to purchase the Extended Service Plan when ordering through the Buy Online, Pick Up in Store program, it must be purchased as part of your online order (you will not be able to add a warranty when you go to the store to pick up your order).
Warranties on products purchased through the Buy Online, Pick Up in Store program are mailed to the customer (they will not be provided at the store when picking up your order).

        Worth the Money!
Bought for my son in Junior Football after he took a big hit in practice and scared me. Fits nicely and he thinks it looks cool...so that works for me. Looked into different products and prices, but felt comfortable that this will actually work like it's suppose to. So far worth the price because he actually likes wearing it.

        Great idea but my son wouldn't go for it
The concept is great. My son is 15 and pitches. I was hoping that he would give it a try. Unfortunately he felt it was too thick to be worn under a baseball hat.I would still like him to try it but it is a little expensive to take that chance.

Protection Plan













Protection and Extended Service Plans
Many products sold through DICKS.com come with a manufacturer's warranty. Customers seeking information about a product's manufacturer's warranty should directly contact the manufacturer.
For certain items, DICKS.com offers an Extended Service Plan, giving you the option to receive up to four years of additional protection against product breakdowns, including mechanical or electrical failure caused by faulty workmanship.
Our Extended Service Plan begins when the manufacturer's warranty expires. Click here for Terms and Conditions. The Extended Service Plan is not offered in Maine due to state law.
Plan Benefits:

Choose from one to four years of additional coverage
Coverage begins after manufacturer warranty expires
It's a no-lemon policy: If a product breaks down for the same reason three times during the coverage, the product will be replaced for free. No hidden fees. No deductibles
Full coverage of parts and labor for repairs from defects or faulty workmanship for products over $100. If your product is not fixed you will receive full replacement cost
Full coverage of parts and labor for repairs from defects or faulty workmanship for products over $100. If your product is not fixed you will receive full replacement cost

Up to $45 for installation, removal or reinstallation costs

How to purchase:

Extended Service Plan options are available for eligible products under a drop down menu on the product page. Coverage is not available for all products

Your selected coverage is shown on the Shopping Cart screen and coverage selections can be changed

Once your product ships you will be mailed the terms and conditions for your plan. For more information about the plans or to submit a service request, contact NEW at 1.866.633.2419.

The plan will only be available at the time of purchase and is not sold separately.

If you would like to purchase the Extended Service Plan when ordering through the Buy Online, Pick Up in Store program, it must be purchased as part of your online order (you will not be able to add a warranty when you go to the store to pick up your order).

        Excellent product for active children
After my son experienced 2 mild concussions from falls, I decided to look for a protective product that had good technology, and that my son was willing to wear. We are glad we found the 2nd Skull headband as he has been wearing it for various activities such as basketball, soccer and ice skating, and loves it
