 Client Discovery

	At the outset of each client relationship, our Family Wealth team engages in a valuable, risk-free and commitment-free discovery process to determine whether we can add value to your particular situation. This process can reveal and identify common wealth management problems such as:

			Inappropriate asset allocation – assets not aligned with a clearly defined investment strategy



			Numerous accounts, with lack of coordination and oversight



			Portfolio withdrawals in excess of that which is sustainable



			Asset and market sector concentrations, which may add unnecessary risk to your portfolio



			Poorly diversified portfolios



			Improperly titled accounts



			Failure to consider tax aspects of investments



			Excessive costs




	After becoming an Ancora Family Wealth client, we will begin the systematic process of addressing identified shortcomings through the implementation of a robust lifetime planning process and an institutional quality investment management program. The result is a comprehensive wealth management solution that provides the ultimate in peace of mind for clients and their families.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Ancora Advisors Sends Letter To Potbelly Corporation (PBPB) Urging The Board Of Directors To Change Its Strategy Or Sell The Company






Jun 22, 2017, 11:10am EDT




















CLEVELAND, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ancora Advisors LLC ("Ancora"), a 4% shareholder of Potbelly Corporation ("Company"), sent a letter this morning to the Board of Directors of Potbelly Corporation. Please find below a summary of and link to the full text of the letter. 





Ancora Advisors LLC is a significant shareholder of Potbelly Corporation ("Potbelly" or "Company"), owning approximately 4% of the outstanding shares. We believe Potbelly has the potential to be a very attractive investment at the current valuation, underpinned by robust store level return on invested capital ("ROIC"), a strong balance sheet, a quality brand and product, and significant growth runway.  However, while the Company targets 25%+ shop level ROIC, it has been unable to translate strong unit level returns to acceptable shareholder returns.
Since going public in October 2013, investors have experienced nothing but losses as owners of Potbelly.  Over every measurable period, Potbelly has underperformed the market, dramatically for the most part.  We believe management and the board's focus on growth at the expense of returns is the primary driver of the underperformance, and we outline some key areas where a change in strategy is needed to put the Company on a path that will reward rather than punish shareholders.  If the board remains convinced that it now has the appropriate strategy in place, we would strongly urge it to immediately pursue a sale / going private transaction, as we do not believe the current strategy would be attractive for current or potential public/minority shareholders over any investable timeframe.
Since the IPO, we believe there has been a lack of accountability by this board with regards to driving value for shareholders.  By slowing low or negative returning owned store growth and shifting to a franchise based model, the Company can produce meaningfully higher FCF / share than the current consensus projections, particularly should the proceeds from a re-franchising transaction be used to repurchase stock. Adopting the franchise strategy could realistically double the share price by 2020.
Considering the majority of this board has overseen the significant under-performance of Potbelly's shares, and has shown such a lack of conviction in the Company's operating plan (as evidenced by minimal purchases of stock), shareholders deserve representation on the board by professionals that actually have a real vested interest in maximizing shareholder value.  We would be happy to assist the board in identifying acceptable board candidates, and we reserve the right to potentially pursue board representation at next year's annual meeting if necessary.
