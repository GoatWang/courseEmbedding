Investor Information












ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
The 1st Global-affiliated, tax-centric CPA firms that offer wealth management have access to a broad variety of complex and sophisticated investment vehicles including alternative investments. These types of investment vehicles provide qualified investors with exposure to markets and strategies that cannot be accessed through traditional fixed income and equity markets.

Separately Managed Accounts
Hedge Funds
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
1031 Exchanges
Structured Investments
Other Direct Participation Programs

Please note that there are special risks of investing in Limited Partnerships, Business Development Companies and REITs such as lack of liquidity and potential adverse economic and regulatory changes. For this reason, there are minimum suitability standards that must be met. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Hedge funds are speculative investments and are not suitable for all investors. The funds are only open to qualified investors who are comfortable with the substantial risks associated with investing in hedge funds. Structured products are not guaranteed investments and the nature of construction is complex and involves risks. You need to speak with your Financial Advisor prior to purchasing any investment products.
MUTUAL FUNDS
1st Global Capital Corp. ("1st Global") offers many mutual funds to investors. We believe it is important that our registered representatives evaluate these funds in order to assist investors in selecting those that best meet their needs. We currently offer mutual funds sponsored by more than 100 companies. Because there are more than 8,000 mutual funds available for sale in the United States, we focus on a select group of some of the largest and most well-known mutual fund families that offer a broad spectrum of investment products. This group of fund families has greater access to our representatives to provide training and other educational presentations and product information so that they can serve investors better. These fund families are participating in our Premier Partner Program.
The following fund families currently participate in the Premier Partner Program: Invesco, Fidelity Funds, John Hancock, OppenheimerFunds and Prudential Investments, LLC.
In addition to the customary sales charges in connection with sales of mutual funds, Premier Partners make payments to 1st Global to participate in the program. First, 1st Global receives a payment of up to 0.68 percent (68 basis points) of an investor's total purchase amount of a mutual fund through a 1st Global registered representative (the "Gross Sales Payment"). If, for example, an investor invested $10,000 in a fund, 1st Global would be paid up to $68. Second, for as long as the investor holds that fund or another fund within the same fund family into which he or she has exchanged, 1st Global will receive an additional payment, paid quarterly, of up to 0.1 percent (ten basis points) per year of the amount held (the "Assets Under Management Payment"). For example, on a $10,000 holding 0.1 percent is $10. Third, 1st Global receives flat amount payments of up to $27,000 per year (“Flat Amount Payment”). These payments are made by the mutual fund's distributor, investment advisor or other related entity. The participants in the Premier Partner Program and/or their affiliates make aggregate payments based on the formula set forth above.
Registered representatives of 1st Global do not receive additional selling compensation in connection with sales of mutual funds offered by our Premier Partners, as opposed to other mutual fund families.

VARIABLE ANNUITIES
We currently offer variable annuities issued by approximately 45 sponsors. Because of the large number of companies offering these products, we have chosen to focus on a select group of some of the largest and best known, which offer a broad array of products and options. These companies have greater access to our representatives to provide educational and training opportunities. These companies are participating in our Premier Partner Program.
At present, the variable annuity issuers that participate in the Premier Partner Program include the following companies: AXA, Guardian, John Hancock, Nationwide, and Penn Mutual.
In addition to the customary sales charges in connection with sales of variable annuities, Premier Partners make payments to 1st Global to participate in the program. 1st Global receives a payment of up to 0.25 percent (25 basis points) of an investor's total deposit into a variable contract (the "Gross Sales Payment"). If, for example, an investor makes a deposit of $10,000, 1st Global would receive up to $25.00. In addition, 1st Global receives flat amount payments of up to $42,000 per year (“Flat Amount Payment”).
1st Global representatives do not receive a greater or lesser commission in connection with sales of variable annuities contracts by Premier Partners as distinct from other annuity companies.

1 1st Global Advisors, Inc. Part 2A of Form ADV: Firm Brochure Merit Drive, Suite 1200 Dallas, TX /6/2016 This brochure provides information about qualifications and business practices of 1st Global Advisors, Inc. 1st Global Advisors, Inc. is a Registered Investment Adviser. Registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training. If you have questions about the contents of this brochure, please call the 1st Global Compliance Department at (214) or e mail us at The information in this brochure has not been approved or verified by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or by any state securities authority. Additional information about our company is available on the SEC s website at2 Material Changes This section of the disclosure brochure ( Brochure ) will summarize the specific material changes that have been made since the previous version of the Brochure was published. The types of changes discussed in this summary will relate to the nature of the material changes we made to our policies, practices, or conflicts of interest. This will help you decide whether to review all or only certain portions of the Brochure or to contact us with questions about the changes that were made. The previous version of this Brochure, dated September 28, 2015, has been amended as follows: The following language regarding alternatives investments has been added to the sections discussing our brokerage practices, other fees and expenses and special product considerations: Non publicly traded REITs and LPs may be sold for a commission by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative. The commission may be roughly seven percent of the purchase price and reduces the number of shares owned. These same products are often also made available by investment adviser representatives at net asset value ( NAV ) and included as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account. This increases the number of shares owned but you may pay more than one percent on the value of the asset for 10 or more years. These products have no liquidity (therefore cannot be managed) and are designed to be held for ten or more years. Additionally, valuation methodologies for certain LPs are subject to substantial limitations and lack of uniformity and while valuation methodologies for non publicly traded REITs have become more uniform (with the recent introduction of more detailed regulatory rules), in our view, those valuations are still not commercially practicable for use in a fiduciary environment as an appropriate billable value. For these reasons, we have chosen to exclude them as billable assets on our advisory platforms. These products may only be offered via commission through our affiliated broker dealer by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative. In the event one of these products undergoes a liquidating event sooner than anticipated, you may end of paying more for the product by paying a commission. Conversely, if the product is owned for the anticipated holding period, you will likely pay more if it is sold to you at NAV and held as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account. In order to obtain these products via NAV you will have to purchase them elsewhere. We will provide you with a summary of any material changes to our Brochure by October 30 of each year. We may further provide other updated disclosure information about material changes, as necessary. You may request a copy of our current Brochure at any time, without charge, by calling us at (214) or e mailing us at Additional information about us is also available via the SEC s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website at  The SEC s website also provides information about any persons affiliated with us who are registered, or are required to be registered, as our investment adviser representatives.

Through our network of affiliated investment adviser representatives ( IARs ), we offer comprehensive financial services to individuals, families, businesses and institutions. We specialize in partnering with CPA, tax, accounting, legal, and dedicated financial professionals. We have been in the investment advisory business since Our principal owner is 1st Global, Inc., which owns all of our shares. The majority of 1st Global, Inc. s shares are owned by Stephen Anthony Batman and family. Stephen Anthony Batman is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The remaining shares are owned by a small number of current and former employees. We Tailor our Advisory Services to the Individual Needs of Clients Our Investment Management Solutions (IMS) platform is designed to provide you with an orderly, disciplined approach to the investment process. IMS offers a personalized program for investing, with customized portfolios, access to world class asset managers and consolidated account performance reporting. We provide you with portfolio construction, asset management, and monitoring. Monitoring constitutes an ongoing process by which: Your investment objectives, constraints and preferences are identified and specified; Strategies are developed and implemented through combinations of financial assets; Capital market conditions and client circumstances are monitored; and Portfolio adjustments are made as appropriate to reflect significant changes in any or all of the above relevant variables. You, assisted by your IAR, complete a risk profile questionnaire (Profile) in the form we provide. The Profile describes your financial situation, investment objectives, time horizon, risk tolerance and investment preferences. We ask you to promptly notify your IAR of any material changes in the information furnished by you in the Profile, including material changes to your financial situation, investment objectives, time horizon, risk tolerance or investment strategy. We use the Profile to provide services to you. Based on information in the Profile, the IAR and you will determine the appropriate portfolio type. We typically provide you with an investment policy statement (IPS) based on the Profile. Our currently available investment management solutions (IMS) portfolio types are designated as: Ultra Conservative, Conservative, Moderate, Growth, and Aggressive Growth. We may change the existing portfolios or introduce new portfolios from time to time. You may change IMS portfolio types whenever you like, including when your objectives or risk tolerance change. You are permitted to place reasonable restrictions on individual securities or types of securities in the IMS Unified Choice program that you wish to exclude from the account, within reasonable parameters set by us and asset managers. We will not substitute another security for the restricted one or request that the asset manager designate a substitute security. We will use cash to represent the percentage of restricted securities. Restrictions may adversely affect the management of your account or the ability to meet your investment objectives. Types of Advisory Services Our platform of investment advisory services is collectively known as Investment Management Solutions, or IMS. Through IMS, you have access to a wide range of investment products, including, but not limited to, mutual funds, exchange traded funds ( ETFs ), common and preferred stocks, municipal, corporate and government fixed income securities, unit investment trusts, certificates of deposit and alternative investments such as fund of funds hedge funds, structured investments and private 56 equity. Our IARs may also offer advice related to direct participation programs and private placements. Please note, nonpublicly traded REITs and LPs may only be sold by IARs that are also registered representatives of our affiliated broker dealer, 1st Global Capital Corp. These products are only sold via commission and you must be a registered representative in order to sell products for a commission. We do not bill advisory fees on these assets. We are the sponsor of all of the following IMS programs: IMS Select Portfolios Program IMS Select Portfolios are diversified asset allocation models invested in pre selected portfolios of mutual funds, money market funds and exchange traded funds. You are assigned an IMS Select Portfolio based on your risk assessment, investable assets and chosen management strategy. We will monitor the IMS Select Portfolios and will make changes to the portfolios if a fund no longer fits the fund selection criteria. When we make changes to the IMS Select Portfolios, positions in your account that are affected by the change will be liquidated and new positions will be purchased. Income tax liabilities may result from the sale of individual securities within your account, unless the account is otherwise tax sheltered or tax deferred. Income tax liabilities directly reduce investment returns. You are responsible for all tax liabilities arising from the sale of individual securities within your account. You may incur short term redemption fees upon the liquidation of a mutual fund position for purposes of rebalancing or the replacement of one fund for another fund in the portfolio. We will attempt to have these fees waived at the time of redemption, but waiver is at the sole discretion of the mutual fund sponsor. IMS Select Portfolios will be managed on a discretionary basis. We will have full authority as your agent and attorney in fact to manage the assets in your account on a fully discretionary basis. For all services, this discretionary authority includes the authority, without first consulting you, to: Determine the portion of assets in your account that will be allocated to each investment or asset class and to change such allocation of assets as necessary; Take any and all other actions on your behalf that we determine are customary or appropriate for a discretionary investment adviser to perform, including the authority to buy, sell, select, remove and replace securities, including mutual fund shares, stocks, bonds and other investments for the account; and Select the broker/dealers or others with which transactions for the account will be effected. Neither we nor the IAR will have the authority to withdraw funds or securities from your account other than for payment of quarterly management fees as agreed to in writing by you. We monitor market conditions and the performance of the IMS Select Portfolios. We reposition assets by rebalancing your account when an asset class is out of tolerance by more than 5%. IMS Portfolio Choice Program IMS Portfolio Choice portfolios are diversified asset allocation models and may be implemented into securities, which generally consist of, but are not limited to, money market funds, mutual funds and exchange traded funds. You and the IAR may choose to exclude certain asset classes from the IMS Portfolio Choice portfolio or choose to disregard the profile for the portfolio type indicated. These exclusions will be listed in the investment policy statement. Your portfolio may be invested similarly to, or different from, other clients with the same or similar objectives. We and the IAR will monitor market conditions and the performance of your portfolio. The IAR will communicate any changes to you and reposition assets as needed. We will automatically rebalance your portfolio back to its original target percentages in accordance with the rebalancing schedule and tolerances determined by you and your IAR. It is important to note that the rebalancing schedules and tolerances are limited in scope and your choice of rebalancing will be amongst the choices provided. IMS Portfolio Choice portfolios will be managed on a discretionary basis. We will have full authority to automatically rebalance the account according to the agreed upon target allocation and rebalancing schedule. This discretionary authority will include the authority, without first consulting you, to determine the amount of assets in each asset class in your account to be bought 67 or sold in order to rebalance the account back to its original target percentages, including the authority to buy, sell, select, remove and replace securities for the account. You may incur short term redemption fees upon the liquidation of a mutual fund position for purposes of rebalancing or the replacement of one fund for another fund in the portfolio. We will attempt to have these fees waived at the time of redemption but waiver of these fees is at the sole discretion of the mutual fund sponsor. Neither we nor the IAR will have the authority to withdraw funds or securities from your account other than for payment of quarterly management fees as agreed to in writing by you. IMS Flex Choice Program IMS Flex Choice Portfolios may be implemented into individual securities, which generally consist of, but are not limited to, money market funds, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, unit investment trusts, exchange traded funds and certificates of deposit. You and the IAR may choose to exclude certain asset classes from your IMS Flex Choice portfolio or choose to disregard the Profile for the portfolio type indicated. These exclusions will be listed in the investment policy statement if one is provided. Your portfolio may be invested similarly to, or different from, portfolios belonging to clients with the same or similar objectives. We and the IAR will monitor market conditions and the performance of your portfolio. The IAR will communicate necessary changes to you and reposition assets as needed. Your IMS Flex Choice account may either be a cash or margin account. A margin account is one in which the firm carrying the account lends cash to you with which you purchase securities. Unlike a cash account, a margin account allows you to buy securities by borrowing the money. In the financial services industry, investors often open margin accounts to take advantage of an opportunity to leverage their investment, not because they lack the money to make the full purchase. However, investors using the IMS Flex Choice platform most often use margin in conjunction with check writing capabilities offered on these accounts. Margin allows you to borrow money in cases where a check is written for an amount greater than the cash balance. While this borrowing has a cost, it also prevents you from prematurely selling securities and allows you to make a later deposit to return the money borrowed. While the use of margin may offer the potential to leverage an investment, and allows you greater flexibility in the operation of your account, buying securities on margin also subjects you to additional costs and risks that should be carefully considered. Your IMS Flex Choice account may be a discretionary account for which the IAR need not seek your approval prior to purchasing or repositioning assets. The use of discretion requires specific written approval from us. In addition, you must provide written authorization to allow your IAR to utilize discretion in the account. As a matter of course, no common stock position should be greater than 5% of the total portfolio value. We may waive this policy if circumstances deem it to be appropriate. IMS Unified Choice Program The IMS Unified Choice Program is a wrap fee program and differs from the other IMS programs in that you pay a single fee for trade execution and portfolio management services. Wrap fee programs differ from other programs in that the fee structure for wrap programs is all inclusive, whereas non wrap programs include trade execution costs that are in addition to the advisory fees. For example, our IMS Select Portfolio program is not considered a wrap fee program because you pay transaction costs that are in addition to the asset management fee and are generally borne by you. In the case of wrap fee programs, such accounts are managed in accordance with the investment methodology and philosophy used by the respective third party portfolio manager. On the other hand, our IMS Flex Choice Program is managed by your IAR in accordance with his or her own investment methodology and philosophy. In some cases, you may decide to forgo a thirdparty portfolio manager to manage the fixed income portion of your wrap fee account and instead choose to have our fixed income department create a bond ladder. You might also choose a third party portfolio manager to manage a portion of your fixed income allocation and have our fixed income department manage a portion of your fixed income allocation. In these instances, the bond ladders created by our fixed income department will be managed in accordance with the investment methodology and philosophy of our fixed income department. For the investment advisory services provided to you by us and your IAR, we and your IAR receive a portion of the investment advisory fee you pay when you participate in the program. For more information relating to our wrap fee program please refer to the 1st Global Advisors, Inc. Wrap Fee Program Brochure. 78 The IMS Unified Choice Program utilizes select third party asset managers who provide us with model portfolios that we use to invest the funds in your account. Portfolios may be invested into one or more of these model portfolios and/or a combination of mutual funds, exchange traded funds or other individual securities. Typically, these portfolios are invested in a combination of all of these types. We provide overlay portfolio management services to your entire portfolio. This allows us to combine and customize multiple investment products to meet your individual goals. In this regard, we are responsible for rebalancing the portfolio and take instructions from the IAR in order to complete specific trades, such as those for tax loss harvesting purposes at year end. Income tax liabilities may result from the sale of individual securities within your account, unless the account is otherwise tax sheltered or tax deferred. Income tax liabilities directly reduce investment returns. You are responsible for all tax liabilities arising from the sale of individual securities within your account. Under certain circumstances, IMS Unified Choice portfolios may be invested entirely in a single asset class. The single asset class portfolios may be invested in the large cap, small cap, international, fixed income or real estate asset classes only. No investment policy statement will be created for single asset class portfolios. You are permitted to place reasonable restrictions on individual securities or types of securities that you wish to exclude from the account, within reasonable parameters set by us and asset managers. We will not substitute another security for the restricted one or request that the asset manager designate a substitute security. We will use cash to represent the percentage of restricted securities. Restrictions may adversely affect the management of your account or the ability to meet your investment objectives. We monitor market conditions and the performance of the IMS Unified Choice portfolios. We reposition assets by rebalancing your account when an asset class is out of tolerance by more than 5%. We have full authority as your agent and attorney in fact to manage your IMS Unified Choice portfolio assets on a fully discretionary basis. For all services, this discretionary authority includes the authority, without first consulting you, to: Determine the portion of assets in your account to allocate to each investment or asset class; Change your allocation of assets as necessary; Take any and all other actions on your behalf that we determine are customary or appropriate for a discretionary investment adviser to perform, including the authority to buy, sell, select, remove and replace securities, including mutual fund shares, stocks, bonds and other investments for the account; and Select the broker/dealer or others with which transactions for the account will be effected. Neither we nor the IAR have authority to withdraw funds or securities from your account other than for payment of quarterly management fees as agreed to in writing by you. Retirement Management Solutions ( RMS ) Our RMS platform is a managed account platform specifically designed for defined contribution qualified plans including, but not limited to, 401(k), profit sharing, safe harbor 401(k), defined benefit, defined contribution, Solo(k) and SIMPLE 401(k) plans. Access to the RMS Platform is made available to you through our IARs. We will design and manage portfolios that may be invested similar to the portfolios of other clients having similar investment objectives. You may develop, in consultation with us, a broad range of investment options and/or model portfolios for individual participant use. Each model portfolio type will be designed to help achieve plan participant retirement objectives while staying within their stated risk tolerance and at the same time, taking into account their time horizon and unique needs and circumstances. The currently available RMS model portfolio types are designed as Ultra conservative, Conservative, Moderate, Growth and Aggressive Growth. Model portfolios may be augmented or modified from time to time by us. Model portfolios are not intended as investment advice for plan participants. Plan participants are free to disregard the model portfolios and choose individual mutual funds and /or ETFs at their sole discretion. The client is the retirement plan, not the individual participants. 89 Investment advisor representatives may provide advice to individual retirement plans and/or employer sponsored retirement plans. Services may include but are not limited to, investment policy statement support, investment selection and monitoring, overall portfolio composition, participant education and guidance to the plan sponsor on their fiduciary obligations to plan participants. When providing services to retirement plans, IARs may act as a fiduciary as defined under Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA. A fiduciary relationship as defined under Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA will be agreed to by both parties in writing. RMS accounts may be opened through one of four platform providers. Approved platform providers include July Business Services ( July ), VOYA Financial, Ascensus and Fidelity Direct. Each platform provider chooses their own service providers including directed trustees, custodians and broker dealers.

Retirement Management Solutions ( RMS ) Advantage RMS Advantage is made available to plan sponsor clients with no investment adviser representative, either because they were referred to us directly or because they have terminated their relationship with a financial intermediary such as an investment adviser representative or registered representative. Under these circumstances, the client will enter into an agreement directly with 1st Global Advisors, Inc., which will be responsible for investing each client s assets through the RMS Platform. RMS Advantage clients will be given access to five model portfolios representing five levels of risk. The portfolios are designed as ultra conservative, conservative, moderate, growth and aggressive growth. Plan participants can choose one of the available model portfolios or choose to implement a portfolio on their own using the funds made available in the model portfolios. The model portfolios are the only investment options available to RMS Advantage plan sponsor clients. The model portfolios will be managed by 1st Global Advisors, Inc. We will serve as a fiduciary and as an Investment Manager for the Plan within the meaning of Section 3(38) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ). We will provide a written investment guideline for your use with your Investment Policy Statement ( IPS ). It is your responsibility to create and adopt such IPS on behalf of the Plan and to periodically review and update the IPS to ensure that it conforms to the Plan s requirements. Our performance is contingent on your approval and adoption of an IPS that is acceptable to us and consistent with our services. In addition, we will provide you with periodic summaries of the performance of the Model Portfolios, summaries of Fund changes and/or additions, terminations and replacements and other written materials as applicable, as well as additional alerts or other notices about the Funds utilized in the Model Portfolios as appropriate from time to time. Finally, we will provide participants with a standardized risk questionnaire, which may be used by participants to help them evaluate their risk profile for purposes of selecting a Model Portfolio. Client acknowledges and agrees that such questionnaire does not constitute fiduciary advice and that Adviser s Services do not include furnishing fiduciary advice to participants. We will only be responsible for the products we select to create our model portfolios and will not have any responsibilities or potential liabilities in connection with other investments (e.g. employer securities, unallocated accounts, mutual fund windows, self directed brokerage windows, etc.) offered by the plan. July will serve as the plan s record keeper and third party administrator. Assets custody with MG Trust Company, LLC and MSCS Financial Services, LLP is the broker dealer of record. 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform ( SRP ) We also offer limited access to certain turn key asset manager programs (TAMPs), which provide access to professional thirdparty asset managers that are outside the scope of the IMS platform. TAMP programs offer you access to a variety of model portfolios with varying levels of risk from which you may choose. TAMP program accounts are not managed by us; rather, they are managed by one or more third party portfolio managers on a discretionary basis, and they may consist of a variety of different securities types, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and derivatives. Account minimums for unaffiliated TAMP 910 program accounts generally range between $25,000 and $50,000. We are not the sponsor of these TAMP programs. We may act in either a solicitor or sub adviser capacity when we offer TAMP programs to you, as described below: Solicitor: When acting as a solicitor for the TAMP program, neither we nor your IAR provide advisory services in relation to the TAMP program. Instead, your IAR will assist you in selecting one or more TAMP programs believed to be suitable for you based on your stated financial situation, investment objectives, and financial goals. We and your IAR are compensated for referring you to the TAMP program. This compensation generally takes the form of the TAMP sharing a percentage of the advisory fee you pay to the TAMP with us and your IAR. When we act as a solicitor for a TAMP program, you will receive a written solicitor disclosure statement describing the nature of our relationship with the TAMP program, if any; the terms of our compensation arrangement with the TAMP program, including a description of the compensation that we will receive for referring you to the TAMP program; and the amount, if any, that you will be charged in addition to the advisory fee that you will pay to the TAMP as a result of our referral of you to the TAMP program. Adviser or Sub Adviser: Under an adviser or sub adviser relationship between us and the sponsor of the TAMP program, we and your IAR will fulfill the role of an adviser or sub adviser to you. We will provide you with portfolio management supervisory services with respect to the adviser or sub adviser TAMP programs you select. That means that we will monitor the TAMP program s performance, investment selection, and continued suitability for your portfolio and will advise you accordingly. Your advisor will help you determine your risk tolerance, investment goals, and other relevant guidelines in order to help you choose a TAMP program that appears to satisfy your investment needs. We have entered into agreements with Lockwood Financial Services, Mount Yale Capital Group, Mellon Private Asset Management, Neuberger Berman, Rochdale, GE Capital Asset Management, Loring Ward Asset Management, Symmetry Partners and SEI Asset Management Program to offer one or both of the services described above. We may enter into similar agreements with like organizations to provide similar portfolio manager search, custodial and performance reporting services. These programs are closed to most advisors and most clients, except in cases where pre established relationships exist. The ability to provide access to these TAMPs or deny access to these TAMPs is at the sole discretion of 1st Global Advisors, Inc. Financial Planning Our IARs may offer you financial planning services at no cost. If financial planning services are offered, the IAR will gather financial information and history from you including but not limited to retirement goals, financial goals, objectives, investment horizon, financial needs, cash flow analysis, cost of living needs, education needs, savings tendencies and other applicable financial information required by the IAR in order to provide the investment advisory services requested. Based upon your needs, the IAR will prepare a written financial plan addressing your needs. This plan may be comprehensive in nature or modular, as dictated by your needs. Financial plans are based on your financial situation at the time and are based on financial information disclosed by you to the IAR. You are advised that certain assumptions may be made with respect to interest and inflation rates and use of past trends and performance of the market and economy. However, past performance is in no way an indication of future performance. We and the IAR cannot offer any guarantees or promises that your stated financial goals and objectives will be met. Further, you must continue to review any plan and update the plan based on changes in your financial situation, goals or objectives or changes in the economy. Should your financial situation, goals, objectives or needs change, you must notify the IAR promptly of the changes. Although financial plans are done at no direct cost to you, we and your IAR may earn commissions or advisory fees should you choose to implement all or a portion of the plan through 1st Global Capital Corp. (our affiliated broker/dealer), 1st Global Advisors, Inc. or other outside money managers. At all times it is solely your choice whether implementation of all or a portion of the recommendations in the plan are done through us, our affiliated broker/dealer or other broker/dealer or money managers chosen by you. You are under no obligation to do anything.

Hedge funds, private equity and structured investments are billable assets. This means that we charge you quarterly advisory fees based on the value of your hedge fund, private equity and structured investment assets. Beyond the infrastructure of the IMS programs, your investment advisory fee is for the specialized advice and guidance provided by your IAR regarding these assets. We make hedge funds and private equity investments available only to qualified purchasers, qualified clients or accredited investors as those terms are defined under applicable securities laws. We make hedge funds and private equity available only to those clients with moderate, growth or aggressive growth profiles. Specifically, your scored profile must be "moderate" or above in order to be able to purchase hedge funds and/or private equity in an account. A client scoring moderate but choosing conservative may purchase hedge funds and/or private equity in limited circumstances. You are permitted to choose conservative and still purchase a hedge fund and/or private equity only when it is required for account grouping purposes and not because you feel a need to accept less risk than the moderate scoring would indicate. We permit this only for instances where you have a group of accounts that are managed together at a risk score of moderate or above, and the account in which the hedge fund and/or private equity will be purchased requires a conservative allocation to support the necessary allocation to fixed income across all accounts. For example, you may choose to be more heavily weighted in fixed income securities in one account, an account with a conservative allocation, and more heavily weighted in equity securities in another account, an account with a more aggressive allocation. When taken in total, your grouped portfolio must be a moderate, growth or aggressive growth allocation to choose these investments. We have the discretion to waive these guidelines for unforeseen circumstances that do not violate our fiduciary obligation. Structured Investments are available only to those clients with a conservative, moderate, growth, or aggressive growth risk profile. We limit your investment in hedge funds or private equity to no more than 10% of your stated net worth. Furthermore and generally, no more than 30% of your portfolio may be allocated to hedge funds, private equity, structured investments, nonpublicly traded REITs and limited partnerships (LPs) combined. No more than 10% of your portfolio may be allocated to a private equity hedge fund or any single Buffered Return Enhanced Note (BREN) offering (a type of structured investment). The rest of the account will be allocated to the appropriate portfolio type as determined by your Profile. The percentage allocated to each asset class within the portfolio type will be proportionately reduced by the percentage of the portfolio allocated to hedge funds, private equity and/or structured products. We make special rebalancing considerations for those accounts incorporating an allocation to hedge funds, private equity or structured products. We caution that you may have limited opportunities to redeem shares of hedge funds or private equity, because the underlying securities may not be available for sale for long periods of time, and the hedge funds and private equity impose restrictions on repurchase offers further limiting exit strategies or redemptions. Structured investments are available in various maturities as outlined in the offering document for the product. Due to these restrictions, the portion of your account allocated to the asset allocation model will be rebalanced independent of any hedge funds, private equity and/or structured investments in the account. The asset allocation model alone will be rebalanced back to the original target allocations of that model. It is not feasible for us to incorporate hedge funds, private equity and/or structured investments into the rebalance process. Once a structured investment matures or a hedge fund or private equity is redeemed, you and the IAR can determine how to reinvest or withdraw the proceeds, and you may fully rebalance your account at that time. Hedge fund and private equity 1112 minimum investment amounts vary as described in the fund s offering document. The minimum account balance required to include an allocation to a structured investment is $100,000. The minimum investment in a structured investment is $1,000. An account found to be in violation of the above concentration limits may be forced to remove illiquid alternatives from the account. Concentration issues may be addressed in a number of ways including the transfer of products to a separate brokerage account or the de networking of a product to be held directly at the product sponsor. For qualified clients, we offer access to other illiquid investments. For qualified clients, we offer access to other illiquid investment alternatives, such as non publicly traded REITs and limited partnership interests. Unlike hedge funds, private equity and structured investments, these are non billable assets and are typically only placed in the account for convenience (avoids multiple accounts) and reporting purposes. We rebalance your asset allocation independent of these products as well. The illiquid alternative portion of the account, which includes hedge funds, private equity, structured investments, non publicly traded REITs and LPs generally may not exceed 30% of the account. We may waive these requirements under circumstances we deem to be appropriate. Non publicly traded REITs and LPs may be sold for a commission by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative. The commission may be roughly seven percent of the purchase price and reduces the number of shares owned. These same products are often also made available by investment adviser representatives at net asset value ( NAV ) and included as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account. This increases the number of shares owned but you may pay more than one percent on the value of the asset for 10 or more years. These products have no liquidity (therefore cannot be managed) and are designed to be held for ten or more years. Additionally, valuation methodologies for certain LPs are subject to substantial limitations and lack of uniformity and while valuation methodologies for non publicly traded REITs have become more uniform (with the recent introduction of more detailed regulatory rules), in our view, those valuations are still not commercially practicable for use in a fiduciary environment as an appropriate billable value. For these reasons, we have chosen to exclude them as billable assets on our advisory platforms. These products may only be offered via commission through our affiliated broker dealer by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative. In the event one of these products undergoes a liquidating event sooner than anticipated, you may end of paying more for the product by paying a commission. Conversely, if the product is owned for the anticipated holding period, you will likely pay more if it is sold to you at NAV and held as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account. In order to obtain these products via NAV you will have to purchase them elsewhere. The amount and type of non publicly traded REIT or LP permissible in an account is based on the risk profile. Please see below for details: Ultra conservative: not permitted at all. Conservative: growth focused products not permitted (only income and income and growth products permitted); Max 10% of account value in income and income and growth sector products. Moderate: all REITs permitted; Max 10% of account value in growth focused and income and income and growth sector products. Growth: all REITs permitted; Max 15% of account value in growth focused and income and growth sector products. Aggressive: all REITs permitted; Max 20% of account value in growth focused and income and income and growth sector products. The Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRP) is generally not permitted when purchasing a REIT inside of an IMS account. We also offer access to a Business Development Company ( BDC ). The BDC is a non billable asset and has special suitability considerations. A client must have a risk tolerance/model of conservative or above and the maximum initial purchase amount is 10% of the total account value. Hedge funds, private equity, structured investments, non publicly traded REITs and LPs are not permitted in the IMS Select Portfolios Core/Satellite models. 1213 Program Choice Conflicts of Interest The specific advisory program selected by you may cost you more or less than purchasing program services separately. Factors that bear upon the cost of a particular advisory program in relation to the cost of the same services purchased separately include, but may not be limited to, the type and size of the account, the historical and/or expected size or number of trades for the account, and the number and range of supplementary advisory and client related services provided to the account. Investment recommendations and advice offered by us and our IARs does not constitute legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should coordinate and discuss the impact of the financial advice you receive from our IARs with your attorney and accountant. We acknowledge that our IARs are commonly CPAs or other tax, accounting or legal professionals, therefore, acting as your CPA, tax or accounting professional or attorney, your IAR may, in this capacity, provide legal, tax or accounting advice. In general, your IAR is responsible for delivering investment advisory services to you, and you generally deal with matters relating to your account(s) by contacting your IAR directly. Compensation to us and your IAR may be more than the amounts we would otherwise receive if you paid for investment advice, brokerage, and/or other relevant services separately. Just as many IARs offer management fee discounts to their larger clients, we retain less of the investment advisory fee as our IAR s total IMS platform assets under management increases. As IARs grow their fee based business within our suite of IMS programs, our economies of scale are shared with IARs by reducing the percentage amount of investment advisory fees that we retain. Our retention decreases as IARs reach specified asset levels. Wrap Fee Program The IMS Unified Choice Program is a wrap fee program and differs from the other IMS programs in that you pay a single fee for trade execution and portfolio management services. Wrap fee programs differ from other programs in that the fee structure for wrap programs is all inclusive, whereas non wrap programs include trade execution costs that are in addition to the asset management fees. For example, our IMS Select Portfolio Program is not considered a wrap fee program because you pay transaction costs that are in addition to the asset management fee and are generally borne by you. In the case of wrap fee programs, such accounts are managed in accordance with the investment methodology and philosophy used by the respective third party portfolio manager. On the other hand, our IMS Flex Choice Program is managed by your IAR in accordance with his or her own investment methodology and philosophy. In some cases, you may decide to forgo a thirdparty portfolio manager to manage the fixed income portion of your wrap fee account and instead choose to have our fixed income department create a bond ladder. You might also choose a third party portfolio manager to manage a portion of your fixed income allocation and have our fixed income department manage a portion of your fixed income allocation. In these instances, the bond ladders created by our fixed income department will be managed in accordance with the investment methodology and philosophy of our fixed income department. For the investment advisory services provided to you by us and your IAR, we and your IAR receive a portion of the annual asset management fee you pay when you participate in any managed account program through us, including the wrap fee program. Assets Under Management As of August 28, 2015, we managed $7,092,967,572 in assets. $4,732,898,515 is managed on a discretionary basis and $2,360,069,057 is managed on a non discretionary basis. Fees and Compensation We Earn Asset Management Fees for the Services We Provide You will pay us and your IAR an annual asset management fee based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM) if you elect to receive asset management services through one or more of our IMS programs. The maximum asset management fee that can be charged in any 1st Global managed account platform is 3% annually and is negotiable. Certain managed account platforms have lower maximum annual fee amounts, and fee schedules will vary among platforms. In most cases, the annual asset management fee is payable quarterly in advance and is computed as one quarter of the annual fee, based on the AUM on the last business day of the previous calendar quarter. Certain managed account platforms charge fees in arrears and will have differing methods of computation. Please refer to the respective platform description below or to the respective client agreement for specific information about the maximum fee allowed, the varying fee schedules of each platform, and the methods of fee billing for the platform(s) you select. 1314 IMS Select Portfolios IMS Portfolio Choice IMS Flex Choice We charge an annual asset management fee of up to 3.00% of assets under management. The asset management fee does not include certain fees and charges related to account services provided by the custodian. The fees and charges for accounts held through National Financial Services LLC ( NFS ) are disclosed in the section titled Account Fees and Charges for Accounts held through NFS. The fees that we charge are in addition to fees charged by any mutual funds in which you may invest. The mutual funds in your portfolio assess charges and fees at the fund level, including fees for investment management services and 12b 1 distribution charges that are permitted under Section 12b 1 of the Securities Exchange Act. You should be aware that these 12b 1 fees come from fund assets and thus, indirectly from your assets. Together with you, we establish the annual asset management fee within the range stated above. Retirement Management Solutions (RMS) We charge an annual asset management fee of up to 3.00% of assets under management. The asset management fee does not include the cost of custodial and record keeping services, which are disclosed in the recordkeeping service agreement. MSCS Financial Services, LLC will process 12b 1 fee rebates for July clients. MSCS retains 10 percent of all 12b 1 fees to perform this task. The remaining fees are rebated back to the plan, pro rata, across all participant positions. EFC Financial, LLC will process 12b 1 fee rebates for Ascensus clients. EFC Financial, LLC retains 5 percent of all 12b 1 fees to perform this task. The remaining fees are deposited into an administrative fee credit account (AFCA) within the trust of each plan. Sub transfer agent fees are also deposited into the AFCA account. The plan client can direct payments for the benefit of the plan from the AFCA to pay recordkeeping and asset management fees. VOYA Financial plan clients must establish an EASE account for the capture of mutual fund revenue in the form of 12b 1 and sub transfer agent fees. The account will be debited first for amounts that are due under the VOYA Financial Services Agreement, if any, and remaining funds will be used to pay the asset management fees and any other reasonable plan expenses the client directs VOYA Financial to pay. The client is responsible for any fees in excess of what is available in the EASE account. Fidelity applies all 12b 1 fees as a credit against sub transfer agent fees. The fund company will pay the net amount of the subtransfer agent fees, less the paid 12b 1 fees to Fidelity. 1st Global Capital Corp., our affiliated broker dealer, does not retain any 12b 1 fees on assets in any of our RMS retirement plans. July clients will be responsible for paying the entire quarterly asset management fee at the first quarterly billing cycle after establishment of the account. Meaning, if your account is established mid quarter, you will pay for the entire quarter. The full quarter asset management fee will be due until and unless all assets are distributed from the plan. Meaning, if all assets are distributed from the plan mid quarter you will not be responsible for paying for a pro rated portion of the asset management fee for the prior quarter. All other providers will pro-rate the initial and final billings based on the remaining days in the calendar quarter. Plan client may choose a fixed fee if plan assets exceed $5 million. Fixed fee pricing is tiered based on plan assets and is a flat dollar amount. The annual fixed fee is divided by four and paid in arrears in quarterly installments. We receive a portion of the total asset management fee paid to your IAR. 1415 RMS Advantage ERISA 3(38) Investment Manager Services are charged as follows: Plan Assets Annual Fee 0 $2,499, % $$2,500,000 $4,999, % $5,000,000 $9,999, % $10,000, % The asset management fee does not include the cost of custodial and record keeping services, which are disclosed in the recordkeeping service agreement. Annual asset management fees have been designed with full acknowledgment that 12b 1 fees not used to offset recordkeeping fees will be rebated back to the plan. 1st Global Capital Corp., our affiliated broker dealer, does not retain any 12b 1 fees on assets in any of our RMS Advantage retirement plans. MSCS Financial Services, LLC will process 12b 1 fee rebates for July clients. MSCS retains 10 percent of all 12b 1 fees to perform this task. The remaining fees are rebated back to the plan, pro rata, across all participant positions. IMS Unified Choice Program We charge an annual asset management fee of up to 3.00% of assets under management. The asset management fee does not include certain fees and charges related to account services provided by the custodian. The fees and charges for accounts held through NFS are disclosed in the section titled Account Fees and Charges for Accounts held through NFS. The fees that we charge are in addition to fees charged by any mutual funds in which you may invest. The mutual funds in your portfolio assess charges and fees at the fund level, including fees for investment management services and 12b 1 distribution charges that are permitted under Section 12b 1 of the Securities Exchange Act. You should be aware that these 12b 1 fees come from fund assets and thus, indirectly from your assets. Your clearing and custody fee includes the first 1,000 transactions in the account on a pro rated calendar year basis commencing 45 days from the funding date of the account. Thereafter, the costs of the first 1,000 transactions each calendar year are included in the clearing and custody fees. After the trade threshold is exceeded in any calendar year, portfolios will incur transaction costs for exchange traded funds, stocks, bonds or other securities and, in the case of a covered plan under 408(b)(2) of ERISA, the transaction cost will not exceed the direct cost or amount that is charged by the custodian for its related services. You will not be responsible for paying clearing and custody fees beginning with the first trade if you elect a diversified portfolio in which a fixed income manager is the only manager chosen in the portfolio. Instead, the portfolio will incur transaction costs for exchange traded funds, stocks, bonds or other securities. The asset management fee varies based on the size of the account and the combination of asset managers, mutual funds, bonds and/or exchange traded funds selected by you and the IAR, though other factors may also influence the amount of the annual asset management fee charged.

Fees for utilizing our fixed income desk are 0.20% of the amount of the fixed income portion of the account. The portion of the account using the fixed income desk will also be subject to clearing and custody fees and advisory fee. Reasons the asset management fee percentage may change each quarter include but are not limited to: The number of managers, or the percentage of assets managed by each existing manager, changes. Hiring additional managers or giving existing managers larger portions of the portfolio to manage may subject these portions of the account to fees from asset managers. Furthermore, as the assets managed by each investment manager change at a rate different from other asset managers or other investment products, the percentage allocated to each manager will vary, which will in turn cause the total percentage fee to vary; and Breakpoints in clearing and custody fees are reached. When accounts increase in value, the clearing and custody fee percentage may decrease, while conversely, when accounts decrease in value, the clearing and custody fee percentage may increase. As stated earlier, you may choose to implement a single asset class portfolio within the IMS Unified Choice Program. Of the single asset class portfolios, a fixed income only portfolio will be subject to a unique fee schedule. This fee schedule takes into consideration the frequency of trading in a fixed income only account and makes adjustments by eliminating the clearing and custody fees. Since there are no clearing and custody fees on fixed income only portfolios, you will be responsible for paying ticket charges on all transactions. You may also be transitioned to this fee schedule if a diversified portfolio utilizing multiple asset classes transition into a single asset class fixed income portfolio. The fee schedule for a fixed income only portfolio is as follows: Fixed Income Only Portfolio Fees Fixed Income Advisory Total Asset Asset Manager Fee Fee Mgmt. Fee.30% = (max 3%) We will receive a portion of the advisory fee paid to your IAR. If your portfolio has both a fixed income and an equity manager, you will be responsible for these transaction costs, plus the fees of an equity asset manager in the portfolio, including clearing and custody fees. This fee schedule will not apply to fixed income only portfolios if you own another IMS Unified Choice account or if that account is owned by an entity controlled by you, or by you together with someone else. In these cases, the standard fee schedule (for IMS Unified Choice Program accounts with both fixed income and equity assets) shown on page 13 will apply to all accounts and will not be aggregated for reduced costs. Reduced costs may be available if both accounts can be and are combined into a single account. We have contractually agreed to pay each fixed income manager a fee equal to 0.30% of the value of your fixed income portfolio annually as charted above. A fixed income manager may choose to be paid less than 0.30% without advance notice to you. The total wrap fee paid by you includes a component (Advisory Fee) which is paid to the IAR or affiliated Registered Investment Adviser. The component (Advisory fee) paid to the IAR or affiliated Registered Investment Adviser is the total asset management fee paid by you minus the fees outlined in the tables above. For example, if you are paying a total asset management fee of 1.0% and the fee tables show fees of 0.40%, than the IAR or affiliated Registered Investment Adviser receives 0.60%. We receive a portion of the Advisory fee paid to your IAR or affiliated Registered Investment Adviser. The portion of the account allocated to a hedge fund, private equity and/or structured investment will be subject to the fixed and variable 1st Global fees. The clearing and custody fees do not apply. The custodian excludes certain assets (non chargeable assets) from the amount it charges us. Non chargeable assets include certain mutual funds, bank certificates of deposit, non marketable securities (for example, hedge funds/private equity, structured investments, non publicly traded REITs and real estate limited partnerships) and cash. We retain the difference 1617 between the amount paid by you and the amount charged to us by the custodian on these non chargeable assets. Because clearing and custody fees apply to the total assets in the account, you may benefit more from utilizing an asset manager s model portfolio in each asset class in order to avoid paying these fees for assets that are considered non chargeable assets. 1st Global's Solicitor Referral Platform The annual asset management fee is up to 3.00% of assets under management. The asset management fee typically includes the cost of custodial services. The assets will be held with a custodian mutually agreeable to you and the portfolio manager. The asset management fee varies primarily based on the size of the account and the portfolio managers selected by you, though other factors may also influence the amount of the annual asset management fee charged. The asset management fee will be determined according to the fee schedule of the portfolio manager sponsoring the program up to a maximum of 3.00%. You should read the Form ADV of the sponsoring third party asset manager for information regarding asset management fees and other expenses. Billing Practices We, through the account custodian, will typically debit the annual asset management fee from your IMS account automatically. The annual asset management fee will be payable first from free credit balances, money market funds, or cash equivalents, if any, and second from the liquidation of a portion of your securities holdings, pursuant to the discretionary authority granted by you to us and the IAR. Rather than automatic fee debiting from your account, you also have the ability to be direct billed by writing a check to us for the fee amount, or instructing us to charge the fee to one of your other 1st Global accounts. You will pay fees quarterly, in advance, based on the specific program selected by you. You will be provided with an invoice that states the value of the assets, fee calculation and amount due or amount withdrawn (to pay fees earned by us and the IAR) only if you pay by check. Those clients choosing to pay by direct debit from the account or another account will not receive an invoice. For all accounts other than 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform and RMS, you will receive a statement from the custodian, NFS, reflecting the withdrawal of fees. It is your responsibility to verify the accuracy of the fee as neither we nor the custodian do so. The amount of the advisory fee will also be reflected in the IMS quarterly performance report. RMS plan clients pay fees in arrears. New July Business Services clients will be responsible for the entire quarterly fee in the quarter in which the account was established. Quarterly fees will be assessed on all accounts until such time as all assets in the account have been distributed. Plan Client may not be responsible for paying the advisory fee for the final quarter, if all assets are distributed from the Plan prior to the final quarterly billing cycle. RMS plan clients will not receive an invoice. All other providers will pro rate the initial and final billings based on the remaining days in the calendar quarter. For RMS accounts, the billing methodology is dependent on your chosen platform provider. July will bill for asset management fees in arrears based on the balance of the account on the last business day of the previous quarter for services rendered in the previous quarter. Fees may be paid from the plan forfeiture account, plan debit pro rata or via ACH. VOYA Financial will bill for asset management fees in arrears based on the balance of the account on the last business day of each month during the previous quarter for services rendered in the previous quarter. While the billing calculation is based on monthly values, participant accounts are not debited on a monthly basis. The fee is debited quarterly and is the average of the three monthly amounts. Please note that the following will be excluded when determining the value of Plan assets: i) any outstanding loan balances, ii) assets in the Self Directed Brokerage Account, iii) the value of any life insurance, and iv) assets in the Employer Stock Fund. Fees will come out of the client s EASE account which will have been funded with 12b 1 and sub transfer agent fees. The plan sponsor is responsible for any amount of the fee not available in the EASE account. Ascensus will bill asset management fees in arrears and will be based on the total market value of the Plan as of the last business day of the quarter (excluding any frozen assets). The amount payable will be 25 percent of the annual fee. Securities in the Plan s account are valued daily based on the closing price as reported by the custodian for the purposes of calculating the market value of the assets in the account that are subject to the fee. Ascensus allows you to choose between two billing methodologies; 1) process an asset based amount from plan assets pro rata based on account balance or per capita, or 2) process an asset based amount from the plan s AFCA (for amounts exceeding the plan s AFCA, the remainder due can be debited from plan assets pro rata based on account balance, per capita, via ACH or from the plan forfeiture account). You will elect which billing method you prefer in the Ascensus Plan Establishment Kit and the RMS Investment Advisory Agreement. Fidelity offers four fee payment method options. 1) annualized basis points paid out quarterly, 2) annualized amount per participant paid out quarterly, 3) 1718 quarterly plan total deducted pro rata in proportion to each participant s account balance and 4) quarterly plan total to be deducted evenly across all participants. We do not provide invoicing for clients of 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform. Other Fees and Expenses In addition to the charges noted above, you may also incur certain charges imposed by third parties other than us or the IAR in connection with certain investments. We and your IAR may receive a portion of these fees. These include, but are not limited to: Mutual fund or money market 12b 1 fees and sub transfer agent fees; Mutual fund and money market management fees and administrative expenses; Mutual fund transaction fees; Certain deferred sales charges on previously purchased mutual funds transferred into the account; Other transaction charges and service fees; IRA and qualified retirement plan fees; and Other charges that may be required by law. If you own mutual funds, the funds may charge early redemption fees if you liquidate fund holdings in your account within a certain period of time after investing them, typically within 30 to 180 days, depending on each fund company's policies. The fees that we charge are in addition to fees charged by any mutual funds in which you may invest. The mutual funds in your portfolio assess charges and fees at the fund level, including fees for investment management services and 12b 1 distribution charges that are permitted under Section 12b 1 of the Securities Exchange Act. You should be aware that these 12b 1 fees come from fund assets and thus, indirectly from your assets. We do not retain any 12b 1 fees on RMS business. These fees and transaction charges present a potential conflict of interest because we may have a greater incentive to recommend (or make investment decisions regarding) investments that provide additional compensation to us. Further information regarding fees and charges assessed by a mutual fund is available in the appropriate mutual fund prospectus. If you invest in the Retirement Management Solutions Platform, a retirement plan may choose a default fund that meets the definition of a Qualified Default Investment Alternative ( QDIA ) as defined in the Pension Protection Act of If you choose a QDIA for your plan, participant assets will be placed in the default fund if no investment elections have been made. Participants must be given an opportunity to provide investment direction. You are responsible for providing a notice to participants in advance of the first investment in the qualified default investment alternative and annually thereafter. Depending on the fund, the fund may charge an annual asset based fee. The fees and charges of the fund options will be listed in their respective prospectus or offering document. Unless you are investing in Retirement Management Solutions or 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform, you must choose a default money market fund upon establishing the account. Cash received into the account will be automatically swept into the default money market fund on an intra day basis and reported on an end of day basis. Depending on the money market fund, there may be an annual asset based fee charged by the money market fund. The fees and charges of the money market fund will be listed in the fund s prospectus. For 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform accounts, fees are determined by the individual third party asset manager on the platform. Clients should refer to the disclosure brochure of the third party asset manager for information regarding fees and expenses. Hedge funds and private equity will also be subject to underlying fund expenses including management and other servicing fees. Typically, you will be responsible for a repurchase fee, a percentage of the amount requested, if you request a distribution and have invested in the hedge fund or private equity for less than the stated holding period outlined in the hedge fund or private equity prospectus/private placement memorandum. Hedge funds and private equity may also assess a performance fee. For more information regarding the fees of hedge funds and private equity, please refer to the prospectus/private placement memorandum offered at time of sale and available from the hedge fund or private equity directly. The fees and expenses of structured investments may change from offering to offering. For a complete breakdown of the fees and expenses of structured investments, please refer to the offering document for that product. 1819 Some asset managers in the IMS Unified Choice Program may execute transactions away from NFS in order to obtain better execution, particularly asset managers who trade fixed income securities. Equity asset managers on the IMS Unified Choice Program provide us with a model of securities. When you choose a particular equity asset manager, we trade your account to match the model provided by that equity asset manager. Unlike equity asset managers who provide us with a model, fixed income asset managers trade your account on an individual basis. Bonds are purchased by fixed income asset managers for your specific account that we then transfer into your account. There may be costs such as mark ups or mark downs associated with those trades placed away from NFS that you will incur. IARs may consider the existence of these mark ups and markdowns when determining the annual asset management fee. Non publicly traded REITs and LPs may be sold for a commission by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative. The commission may be roughly seven percent of the purchase price and reduces the number of shares owned. These same products are often also made available by investment adviser representatives at net asset value ( NAV ) and included as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account. This increases the number of shares owned but you may pay more than one percent on the value of the asset for 10 or more years. These products have no liquidity (therefore cannot be managed) and are designed to be held for ten or more years. Additionally, valuation methodologies for certain LPs are subject to substantial limitations and lack of uniformity and while valuation methodologies for non publicly traded REITs have become more uniform (with the recent introduction of more detailed regulatory rules), in our view, those valuations are still not commercially practicable for use in a fiduciary environment as an appropriate billable value. For these reasons, we have chosen to exclude them as billable assets on our advisory platforms. These products may only be offered via commission through our affiliated broker dealer by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative. In the event one of these products undergoes a liquidating event sooner than anticipated, you may end of paying more for the product by paying a commission. Conversely, if the product is owned for the anticipated holding period, you will likely pay more if it is sold to you at NAV and held as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account. In order to obtain these products via NAV you will have to purchase them elsewhere. Account Fees and Charges for Accounts held through NFS The following fees and charges apply for accounts held through NFS. Fees and charges are subject to change. Additional fees may apply for specific account features such as check writing, debit or charge cards, and bill pay services. Please refer to specific account documentation for further information. Product Type Equities ETFs Mutual Funds Fixed Income UITs Foreign Equity Maximum Charge $15 per trade $15 per trade $15 per trade $14.50 per trade $35 per trade $90 per trade For a complete listing of custodial fees and charges, please see the fee schedule on our public website at  Scroll down the page to Client Account Information and select Client Account Fees and Expenses for NFS Accounts. Our custodian, NFS, assesses a transaction fee surcharge of $10.00 on certain mutual funds. These funds are subject to the transaction surcharge because they do not pay NFS standard administrative and/or service fees. The list of affected fund families is subject to change at any time, without prior notice, and is included below for your review. Dodge & Cox CGM Dimensional Sequoia Vanguard We are currently absorbing this fee but may not continue to do so in the future. The additional fee will be passed through to you if we discontinue absorbing this fee. This will result in the addition of a $10 surcharge to you on all trades in the above fund families. Transaction costs are not commissions; they are clearing costs charged by the designated clearing firm on the account and are subject to change at any time. Either we or the IAR may decide to bear the costs of transactions under certain circumstances. 1920 Termination and Advisory Fees For all accounts other than Retirement Management Solutions and 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform, we will charge asset management fees in advance upon establishing the value of the portfolio based on the proportion of the number of days remaining in the quarter. Thereafter, we will charge quarterly fees based on the value of the portfolio on the last business day of the prior quarter or the date the custodian values the portfolio for the month end statement at the end of the prior quarter. The value of the portfolio generally includes the value of all securities held in the account, including the value of money market mutual funds, but excluding non billable assets. The asset management fees are payable by you upon initial statement at the end of the prior quarter. The asset management fees payable upon initial implementation of the account are payable by you upon receipt of an invoice from us, or we collect them directly from the account or from another account of yours. Pursuant to a fee authorization and initial power of attorney signed by you, we will calculate asset management fees for all subsequent periods as of the last business day of the previous quarter. If your account does not contain sufficient funds to pay asset management fees, we will have limited authority to sell or redeem securities in sufficient amounts to pay asset management fees. You may reimburse the portfolio for asset management fees that are paid from the portfolio. If you have chosen to pay upon receipt of an invoice, fees due and payable that have not been collected 45 days after receipt of the invoice will be debited from your account. Furthermore, if you fail to pay an invoice after a second notice, the account will be changed to be automatically debited each quarter. RMS plan clients utilizing July Business Services will be responsible for the entire quarterly asset management fee at the first quarterly billing cycle after establishment of the account. As long as there are billable assets in an RMS account you will be responsible for paying fees. You will not be responsible for paying your next quarterly fees if all assets have been distributed from the account. For example, if all assets in the plan have been distributed by Feb 20th, you will not responsible for paying a bill for the 1st quarter even though you had assets in the plan during the 1st quarter. All other RMS plan clients will pay a prorated amount when the account is opened and a pro rated amount after all assets have been distributed from the plan. For 1st Global s Solicitor Referral Platform accounts, fees are determined by the individual third party asset manager on the platform. You should refer to the disclosure brochure of the third party asset manager for information regarding fees and expenses. You may terminate the agreement with us within five business days of signing the agreement without incurring any charges. Furthermore, we or you may terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. You are responsible for fees during the period between notice and final termination, which is the end of the 30 day period. We may waive the 30 day written notice requirement at our sole discretion. No refund will be provided if the account terminates within the final 15 days of a calendar quarter. Accounts with no financial intermediary (no assigned financial advisor), will continue to pay our portion of the total advisory fee. This fee is to cover administrative services which may be provided until the account is transferred away from the Firm. Upon notice of termination, we will await further instructions from you as to what steps you request to liquidate and/or transfer the portfolio and remit the proceeds. Upon instructions received, we will instruct brokers, dealers, mutual fund sponsors, and others to liquidate and/or transfer the portfolio and remit proceeds to you. Upon termination of your IMS account, we will refund our unearned asset management fee on a prorated basis as determined by us. We cannot make any representation regarding investment features that may limit your ability to liquidate or transfer all or a portion of your portfolio. In these cases, we will consider your agreement terminated as per the language in the agreement and stated here. For information on features that may limit or impair the ability to sell or transfer an asset, you are advised to review the prospectus, offering document or participation agreement. Additional Compensation Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs) of 1st Global Advisors, Inc. may also be Registered Representatives (RRs) of our affiliated broker dealer, 1st Global Capital Corp. The majority of our IARs are also RRs of our affiliated broker dealer. Our IARs may offer financial planning services at no cost. These recommendations may be implemented through the broker dealer or us. When implemented through the broker dealer, RRs of 1st Global Capital Corp. receive commissions from the sale of investment products, including the sale of mutual funds. Mutual funds assess charges and fees at the fund level, including fees for 20  View more
