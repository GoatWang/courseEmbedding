Allen J. Frances (born 1942 in New York City, New York) is an American psychiatrist. Frances' early career was spent at Cornell University Medical College where he rose to the rank of professor. In 1991, he became chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine. Frances was the founding editor of two well-known journals: the Journal of Personality Disorders and the Journal of Psychiatric Practice.
Frances chaired the task force that produced the fourth revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) and became critical of the current version, DSM-5. He warned that the expanding boundary of psychiatry is causing a diagnostic inflation that is swallowing up normality and that the over-treatment of the "worried well" is distracting attention from the core mission of treating the more severely ill. In 2013, Frances said that "psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests".[1][2]

Education and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Frances was born in New York City, US, in 1942. He received his bachelor's degree in pre-med and economics from Columbia College in 1963; his MD from Downstate Medical Center in 1967; completed his psychiatric residency at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1971; and received a certificate in psychoanalytic medicine from the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research 1978.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Frances' early career was spent at Cornell University Medical College where he rose to the rank of professor, headed the outpatient department, saw patients, taught, established a brief therapy program, and developed research specialty clinics for schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and AIDS. Throughout his academic career, Frances was an active investigator and prolific author in a surprisingly wide range of clinical areas including personality disorders, chronic depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, AIDS, and psychotherapy. And in 1991, he became chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine where he helped to expand the research, training, and clinical programs that had been initiated by his predecessor as chair, Dr Bernard Carroll.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
Frances' book on Differential Therapeutics[3] tried to bring specificity and evidence to decisions on how best to match patient and treatment. His recognition of therapeutic limits resulted in the 1981 paper No Treatment as the Prescription of Choice.[4] Dr Frances was the founding editor of two journals that have become standards: The Journal of Personality Disorders and the Journal of Psychiatric Practice.
In 2013, Allen Frances wrote a paper entitled "The New Crisis of Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis", which said that "psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests".[1][5] Frances was also concerned about "unpredictable overdiagnosis".[1]
The Diagnostic Manual of Mental Illnesses[edit]
DSM-IV[edit]
The DSM provides definitions of mental disorders that are widely used to guide clinical practice, research, education, forensics, and eligibility for mental health treatment, school services, and disability benefits. Dr Frances helped to prepare DSM III (published in 1980), DSM III R (published in 1987); and was Chair of the Task Force that published DSM IV in 1994. The earlier DSM revisions had relied on expert opinion to create definitions of disorders. The DSM IV was a more conservative revision requiring that changes be justified by a high threshold of scientific evidence drawn from literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field testing. Of the ninety-four suggestions for new diagnoses, only two were accepted—Asperger's and Bipolar II Disorder. The DSM-IV Sourcebook[6] documents the rationale and scientific support for all the decisions made. Minor updates in the explanatory text were added in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR).
Despite its conservative intent and careful methodology, DSM-IV was not able to prevent diagnostic inflation. Rates of attention deficit disorder tripled as a result of heavy drug company marketing starting in 1997—instigated by the introduction of new on-patent drugs and facilitated by the removal of federal prohibitions against direct-to-consumer advertising. Rates of autism increased by more than twentyfold largely because the loose diagnosis followed its becoming a prerequisite for extra school services. Rates of bipolar disorder doubled largely because of drug company marketing. And rates of bipolar disorder in children increased by fortyfold when thought leaders and drug companies convinced practitioners that temperamental kids had bipolar disorder even if they didn't have mood swings—a concept that had been rejected by DSM-IV. Frances later felt that DSM-IV should have fought more vigorously against the risks of diagnostic inflation by tightening diagnostic criteria and providing more specific warnings against over-diagnosis. Frances co-authored Am I Okay?: A Layman's Guide to the Psychiatrist's Bible with psychiatrist Michael First.[7]
DSM-5[edit]
The next revision DSM-5 was initiated with a 2002 book (A Research Agenda for DSM-V[8]) questioning the utility of the atheoretical, descriptive paradigm and suggesting a neuroscience research agenda aiming to develop a pathophysiologically based classification. After a series of symposiums, the task force began to work on the manual itself. In June 2008, Dr. Robert Spitzer who chaired the DSM-III and DSM-IIIR revisions had begun to write about the secrecy of the DSM-V Task Force (DSM-V: Open and Transparent?[9]). Frances initially declined to join Spitzer's criticism, but after learning about the changes being considered,[10] he wrote an article in July 2009 (A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences[11]) expressing multiple concerns including the unsupported paradigm shift, a failure to specify the level of empirical support needed for changes, their lack of openness, their ignoring the negative consequences of their proposals, a failure to meet timelines, and anticipate the coming time pressures. The APA/DSM-V Task Force response (Setting the Record Straight: A Response to Frances Commentary on DSM-V[12]) dismissed his complaints.
In March 2010, Frances began a weekly blog in Psychology Today, DSM-5 in Distress: The DSM's impact on mental health practice and research,[13] often cross-posted in the Psychiatric Times[14] and the Huffington Post.[15] While many of his blog posts were about the DSM-5 Task Force lowering the thresholds for diagnosing existing disorders (attention deficit disorder, autism, addictions, personality disorders, bipolar II disorder), he was also disturbed by the addition of new speculative disorders (Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder). He has argued that the diagnosis attenuated psychosis syndrome promoted by advocates of early intervention for psychosis, such as Australian psychiatrist Patrick McGorry, is risky because of a high rate of inaccuracy, the potential to stigmatize young people given this label, the lack of any effective treatment, and the risk of children and adolescents being given dangerous antipsychotic medication.[16] The elimination of the bereavement exclusion from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder was another particular concern, threatening to label normal grief as a mental illness. So while the task force was focusing on early detection and treatment, Frances cautioned about diagnostic inflation, overmedication, and crossing the boundary of normality. Besides the original complaint that the DSM-5 Task Force was a closed process, Frances pointed out that they were behind schedule and even with a one-year postponement, they had to drop a follow-up quality control step. He recommended further postponement and advocated asking an outside body to review their work to make suggestions. While the American Psychiatric Association did have an internal review, they rejected his suggestion of an external consultation. When the field testing for inter-rater reliability was released in May 2012, several of the more contested disorders were eliminated as unreliable[17] (attenuated psychosis syndrome, mixed anxiety depression) and the reliabilities were generally disappointing. The APA Board of Trustees eliminated a complex "Cross-Cutting" Dimensional System, but many of the contested areas remained when the document was approved for printing in December 2012 for a scheduled release in May 2013. There were widespread threats of boycott.
Frances's writings were joined by a general criticism of the DSM-5 revision, ultimately resulting in a petition calling for outside review signed by 14,000 and sponsored by 56 mental health organizations. In the course of almost three years of blogging, Frances became a voice for more than just the specifics of the DSM-5 Diagnostic Manual. He spoke out against the overuse of psychiatric medications—particularly in children; a general trend towards global diagnostic inflation—pathologizing normality; the intrusion of the pharmaceutical industry into psychiatric practice; and a premature attempt to move psychiatry to an exclusively biological paradigm without scientific justification. Along the way, he wrote two books: "Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life[18]" and "Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis[19]" meant to guide clinicians and to help curb unwarranted diagnostic exuberance. He has decided to continue writing on a new Psychology Today blog called Saving Normal.[20]

He received his bachelor's degree in pre-med and economics from Columbia College in 1963; his MD from Downstate Medical Center in 1967; completed his psychiatric residency at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1971; and received a certificate in psychoanalytic medicine from the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research 1978.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Frances' early career was spent at Cornell University Medical College where he rose to the rank of professor, headed the outpatient department, saw patients, taught, established a brief therapy program, and developed research specialty clinics for schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and AIDS. Throughout his academic career, Frances was an active investigator and prolific author in a surprisingly wide range of clinical areas including personality disorders, chronic depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, AIDS, and psychotherapy. And in 1991, he became chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine where he helped to expand the research, training, and clinical programs that had been initiated by his predecessor as chair, Dr Bernard Carroll.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
Frances' book on Differential Therapeutics[3] tried to bring specificity and evidence to decisions on how best to match patient and treatment. His recognition of therapeutic limits resulted in the 1981 paper No Treatment as the Prescription of Choice.[4] Dr Frances was the founding editor of two journals that have become standards: The Journal of Personality Disorders and the Journal of Psychiatric Practice.
In 2013, Allen Frances wrote a paper entitled "The New Crisis of Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis", which said that "psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests".[1][5] Frances was also concerned about "unpredictable overdiagnosis".[1]
The Diagnostic Manual of Mental Illnesses[edit]
DSM-IV[edit]
The DSM provides definitions of mental disorders that are widely used to guide clinical practice, research, education, forensics, and eligibility for mental health treatment, school services, and disability benefits. Dr Frances helped to prepare DSM III (published in 1980), DSM III R (published in 1987); and was Chair of the Task Force that published DSM IV in 1994. The earlier DSM revisions had relied on expert opinion to create definitions of disorders. The DSM IV was a more conservative revision requiring that changes be justified by a high threshold of scientific evidence drawn from literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field testing. Of the ninety-four suggestions for new diagnoses, only two were accepted—Asperger's and Bipolar II Disorder. The DSM-IV Sourcebook[6] documents the rationale and scientific support for all the decisions made. Minor updates in the explanatory text were added in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR).
Despite its conservative intent and careful methodology, DSM-IV was not able to prevent diagnostic inflation. Rates of attention deficit disorder tripled as a result of heavy drug company marketing starting in 1997—instigated by the introduction of new on-patent drugs and facilitated by the removal of federal prohibitions against direct-to-consumer advertising. Rates of autism increased by more than twentyfold largely because the loose diagnosis followed its becoming a prerequisite for extra school services. Rates of bipolar disorder doubled largely because of drug company marketing. And rates of bipolar disorder in children increased by fortyfold when thought leaders and drug companies convinced practitioners that temperamental kids had bipolar disorder even if they didn't have mood swings—a concept that had been rejected by DSM-IV. Frances later felt that DSM-IV should have fought more vigorously against the risks of diagnostic inflation by tightening diagnostic criteria and providing more specific warnings against over-diagnosis. Frances co-authored Am I Okay?: A Layman's Guide to the Psychiatrist's Bible with psychiatrist Michael First.[7]
DSM-5[edit]
The next revision DSM-5 was initiated with a 2002 book (A Research Agenda for DSM-V[8]) questioning the utility of the atheoretical, descriptive paradigm and suggesting a neuroscience research agenda aiming to develop a pathophysiologically based classification. After a series of symposiums, the task force began to work on the manual itself. In June 2008, Dr. Robert Spitzer who chaired the DSM-III and DSM-IIIR revisions had begun to write about the secrecy of the DSM-V Task Force (DSM-V: Open and Transparent?[9]). Frances initially declined to join Spitzer's criticism, but after learning about the changes being considered,[10] he wrote an article in July 2009 (A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences[11]) expressing multiple concerns including the unsupported paradigm shift, a failure to specify the level of empirical support needed for changes, their lack of openness, their ignoring the negative consequences of their proposals, a failure to meet timelines, and anticipate the coming time pressures. The APA/DSM-V Task Force response (Setting the Record Straight: A Response to Frances Commentary on DSM-V[12]) dismissed his complaints.
In March 2010, Frances began a weekly blog in Psychology Today, DSM-5 in Distress: The DSM's impact on mental health practice and research,[13] often cross-posted in the Psychiatric Times[14] and the Huffington Post.[15] While many of his blog posts were about the DSM-5 Task Force lowering the thresholds for diagnosing existing disorders (attention deficit disorder, autism, addictions, personality disorders, bipolar II disorder), he was also disturbed by the addition of new speculative disorders (Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder). He has argued that the diagnosis attenuated psychosis syndrome promoted by advocates of early intervention for psychosis, such as Australian psychiatrist Patrick McGorry, is risky because of a high rate of inaccuracy, the potential to stigmatize young people given this label, the lack of any effective treatment, and the risk of children and adolescents being given dangerous antipsychotic medication.[16] The elimination of the bereavement exclusion from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder was another particular concern, threatening to label normal grief as a mental illness. So while the task force was focusing on early detection and treatment, Frances cautioned about diagnostic inflation, overmedication, and crossing the boundary of normality. Besides the original complaint that the DSM-5 Task Force was a closed process, Frances pointed out that they were behind schedule and even with a one-year postponement, they had to drop a follow-up quality control step. He recommended further postponement and advocated asking an outside body to review their work to make suggestions. While the American Psychiatric Association did have an internal review, they rejected his suggestion of an external consultation. When the field testing for inter-rater reliability was released in May 2012, several of the more contested disorders were eliminated as unreliable[17] (attenuated psychosis syndrome, mixed anxiety depression) and the reliabilities were generally disappointing. The APA Board of Trustees eliminated a complex "Cross-Cutting" Dimensional System, but many of the contested areas remained when the document was approved for printing in December 2012 for a scheduled release in May 2013. There were widespread threats of boycott.
Frances's writings were joined by a general criticism of the DSM-5 revision, ultimately resulting in a petition calling for outside review signed by 14,000 and sponsored by 56 mental health organizations. In the course of almost three years of blogging, Frances became a voice for more than just the specifics of the DSM-5 Diagnostic Manual. He spoke out against the overuse of psychiatric medications—particularly in children; a general trend towards global diagnostic inflation—pathologizing normality; the intrusion of the pharmaceutical industry into psychiatric practice; and a premature attempt to move psychiatry to an exclusively biological paradigm without scientific justification. Along the way, he wrote two books: "Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life[18]" and "Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis[19]" meant to guide clinicians and to help curb unwarranted diagnostic exuberance. He has decided to continue writing on a new Psychology Today blog called Saving Normal.[20]

About the Book 



From "the most powerful psychiatrist in America" (New York Times) and "the man who wrote the book on mental illness" (Wired), a deeply fascinating and urgently important critique of the widespread medicalization of normality Anyone living a full, rich life experiences ups and downs, stresses, disappointments, sorrows, and setbacks. These challenges are a normal part of being human, and they should not be treated as psychiatric disease. However, today millions of people who are really no more than "worried well" are being diagnosed as having a mental disorder and are receiving unnecessary treatment. In Saving Normal, Allen Frances, one of the world's most influential psychiatrists, warns that mislabeling everyday problems as mental illness has shocking implications for individuals and society: stigmatizing a healthy person as mentally ill leads to unnecessary, harmful medications, the narrowing of horizons, misallocation of medical resources, and draining of the budgets of families and the nation. We also shift responsibility for our mental well-being away from our own naturally resilient and self-healing brains, which have kept us sane for hundreds of thousands of years, and into the hands of "Big Pharma," who are reaping multi-billion-dollar profits.Frances cautions that the new edition of the "bible of psychiatry," the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), will turn our current diagnostic inflation into hyperinflation by converting millions of "normal" people into "mental patients." Alarmingly, in DSM-5, normal grief will become "Major Depressive Disorder"; the forgetting seen in old age is "Mild Neurocognitive Disorder"; temper tantrums are "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder"; worrying about a medical illness is "Somatic Symptom Disorder"; gluttony is "Binge Eating Disorder"; and most of us will qualify for adult "Attention Deficit Disorder." What's more, all of these newly invented conditions will worsen the cruel paradox of the mental health industry: those who desperately need psychiatric help are left shamefully neglected, while the "worried well" are given the bulk of the treatment, often at their own detriment.Masterfully charting the history of psychiatric fads throughout history, Frances argues that whenever we arbitrarily label another aspect of the human condition a "disease," we further chip away at our human adaptability and diversity, dulling the full palette of what is normal and losing something fundamental of ourselves in the process. Saving Normal is a call to all of us to reclaim the full measure of our humanity.

Critical Praise
“Frances delves deeply into the history of mental illness, makes his arguements crisply, and has good personal stories to tell. He’s articulate and learned. ... He’s in favor of not medicating, and thus muffling, all the offbeat pain and beauty out of existance. ... [A] piece of intellectual skywriting.” — Dwight Garner, New York Times

“Frances is largely credited with spearheading the anti-DSM-5 efforts.” — CNN.com
“Saving Normal is a clear, convincing, and essential discussion of the twin epidemics facing modern psychiatry: under-treatment of the truly ill and overtreatment of the basically well. It holds immense potential to improve patients’ lives.” — JOSH BAZELL, M.D., New York Times bestselling author of Beat the Reaper: A Novel
“Few are as well-equipped as Frances to map the dynamic field of psychiatry, and his rendering of its shifting contours is timely, crucial, and insightful--as are his solutions for navigating it.” — Publishers Weekly
“With Solomon-like wisdom, Frances justly doles out blame and offers reasonable remedies. His decree: don’t medicalize human difference; celebrate it.” — Booklist (starred review)
“A valuable assessment. ... A no-holds-barred critique.” — Kirkus Reviews
“An indispensable guide for professional and lay readers” — Library Journal
“Allen Frances’s book is fascinating. ... Entertaining.” — Metapsychology

DSM-5: Where Do We Go From Here?






By Allen Frances










110






















The publication of DSM-5 is a sad moment for psychiatry and a risky one for patients. My recommendation for clinicians is simple. Don't use DSM-5 -- there is nothing official about it, nothing especially helpful in it, and all the codes you need for reimbursement are already available for free on the Internet or in DSM-IV. New codes will go into effect in Oct 2014 -- but these will also be free online. Spending $199 on the DSM-5 white elephant makes no sense.
My advice to patients is more complicated and difficult to accomplish. Psychiatric diagnosis can be a turning point in your life leading to great good if accurate, great harm if not. Take at least as much care in buying a diagnosis as when you buy a house or car. Become fully informed consumers, knowledgeable enough  to challenge doctors who make quick or questionable diagnostic calls. Never accept a diagnosis or take pills that are prescribed after a brief evaluation. 
Always be prepared to ask lots of questions and expect common sense answers. If you don't get them seek a second opinion. Make sure the diagnosis fits well efore you buy it.
Education and discussion will be the most powerful ways to mitigate the risks of DSM-5. The more people know about psychiatric diagnosis, the more likely it will be safe, accurate, and useful.
That's why I am so pleased that Thomas Nickel Ph.D., Head of Continuing Education at Alliant International University, has set up a new interactive DSMOOC web site that will undoubtedly become the focal point for diagnostic discussion and remediation. Check it out. 
Dr. Nickel writes:
 "Now that DSM-5 is about to be released, it is time to determine how best to reduce, if not entirely eliminate, the risk that people will be misdiagnosed and improperly treated."
"Solutions will not come from one group or one project. As one of what will hopefully be many initiatives, we have developed a MOOC (Massive Open Online Conversation) to bring together concerned clinicians and the public in order to give voice to the many different perspectives about psychiatric diagnosis."
"Our intention is to stimulate conversations that will lead to useful products. People will find each other and work together to produce materials that can empower patients and influence practitioners. Suggestions for guidelines, practice standards, public policy, and research will hopefully emerge. Certainly, we will make every effort to facilitate this."
"Previous MOOCs have resembled  traditional university courses with lectures and quizzes on technical topics like artificial intelligence or mechanical engineering. Until now, MOOCs have not been closely linked to events happening in the world, nor have they been a channel for real world action. In this regard, a MOOC focused on DSM-5 may be pioneering."
"Our MOOC will consist of about 15 channels, each one dedicated to one area of significant change or controversy in DSM-5. Each will provide background information; videotaped discussions by leading experts and consumer advocates; references; links; vivid portrayals of psychiatric diagnosis in films and fiction; and an opportunity for discussion. There are even Google Hangouts all set up for study groups to use."
"Our DSMOOC should be equally interesting for professionals and consumers- and will provide a uniquely open forum for interaction between them."
"We hope that you will roll up your virtual sleeves, join us at: http://discuss.thementalhealthmanual.com "
Thanks, Dr Nickel, for generating this terrific idea and for all the work and attention to detail that must have gone into setting it up. I have no doubt you will provide an enormously useful educational center and a much appreciated meeting place of ideas.
I can see only one possible consolation from the otherwise depressing DSM-5 debacle -- perhaps it will stimulate a vigorous discussion of the real strengths, but also serious weaknesses, of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. The more that clinicians and patients know about psychiatric diagnosis, the greater will be its benefits, the fewer its harms.

Balancing Patient Freedom With Safety And Well Being

We need a common sense approach to balance the important value of patient freedom with the equally important value of personal and public safety.  









"Please empathize with me, Doctor!”

The doctor/patient relationship has been the central instrument of healing throughout the history of medicine, but has become a lost art. We have to teach doctors to better understand their patients so that they can become better healing instruments.









A Checklist To Stop Misuse Of Psychiatric Medication In Kids

The exponential growth in the use of psycho-stimulants, anti-depressants, and anti-psychotic drugs often harms children more than helps them. This Checklist to help clinicians think through the necessary steps before prescribing medicines.









School Refusal and Severe Social Withdrawal

A kid not going to school is a crisis for  family and school. Parents and teachers often feel helpless and perplexed. The kid may quickly spiral down into increased anxiety, avoidance, despair, and gaming. Starting treatment early reduces the risks the child will develop severe school refusal and become completely homebound.









Think Twice Before Getting Knee Surgery

Accumulating evidence now proves that much of arthroscopic (keyhole) knee surgery may be unnecessary because the results are no better than placebo. This is an especially startling finding because this is the second most common surgical procedure in the world (after cataract surgery).











Life Is Not a Premortality Condition 

Western medical science has changed life into a premortality condition and death into a failure of treatment.









Dying Well Means Dying At Home

There is no worse death than a hospital death. Dying well means dying at home. This requires preparation and preparation requires recognizing that dying is a necessary, and indeed desirable, part of life. Preparing for a good death may be one of the best decisions you will ever make in your life.












What's in a Name?

Diagnosis and empathy are necessary partners in any therapeutic relationship, fully complementary and in no way incompatible.









Don't Give Up on the Difficult Patient

The most difficult patients often eventually form the deepest relationships and have the most satisfying outcomes. We are most important and make the biggest difference in the lives of the people who need us most, even if the day to day is not always smooth. With redirection, what was once the power to destroy can now become the power to heal and create.









Falls End Lives; Good Balance Saves Them

Falling is a major cause of disability and death. Physical exercise and specific balance tasks greatly reduce the risks. People who don't change their behavior to prevent falls are almost sure to have them.










Buying And Selling Binge Eating Disorder   

In Greek myth, Cassandra was cursed with the gift of seeing the future without having any power to change it. I now know the feeling. What a mess.









Wilderness Programs for a Struggling Child

As a last resort for behaviorally disturbed kids, wilderness programs provide a new chapter and offer an opportunity for greater self-control, self-esteem, and wisdom. They are good for the kids, their families, the juvenile justice system, and society.









Psychotherapy Works But Not for Everyone

Treatments that work well for most don't work well for all. And even effective treatments have side effects and complications. This is true of medication and surgery—and it is also true of psychotherapy.










Welcoming the Mentally Ill Back into Our Community

It has been my life’s passion to help the victims of mental illness discover that they can again be loveable, loving, purposeful people with the ability no longer to be overwhelmed by their illness.









The Crisis of Confidence in Medical Research

Randomized placebo controlled studies have been the gold standard in medical research, but some believe they have been so corrupted by Pharma that they cannot be trusted.










There's No Back Pain Surgery Can't Make Worse

Surgeons are too quick to operate on back pain and doctors are to quick to prescribe dangerously addicting opioids. Much better bets are rehab exercises and mindfulness.









Having a Severe Mental Illness Means Dying Young

People diagnosed with serious mental illness-schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or sever depression- die 20 years early because of a combination of lousy medical care, smoking, lack of exercise, complications of medication, suicide, and accidents. They are the most discriminated against and neglected group in the US, which has become probably the worst place in the developed









The Globalization Of Attention Deficit Disorder

Mental disorders have become a global commodity. A diagnostic fad heavily promoted first in the US now quickly spreads around the world. Parents must protect their kids from the drug company promoted flood of massive ADHD over diagnosis and over treatment.










Surviving Suicide: A Mother’s Search for Meaning

I have known dozens of mothers who have lost children to suicide. None ever really got over it. All remained intermittently haunted and forever felt a hollowness in life. But life must go on and a serving mother explains how she found new meaning and purpose.










Price Tags On Medical Procedures To Stimulate Competition

The Internet has reduced the price, and increased the convenience, of shopping for just every product in our economy- except medical care. Why not use comparative posted prices to empower consumers and reduce the monopoly power of providers.









Psychiatry and Recovery

Psychiatry and Recovery have compatible and complementary contributions to make in treating mental illness and in advocating for better funding and community care.









Back to Normal

We have become a dangerously pill popping society. I offer practical tips on how people can avoid being over-diagnosised and over-medicated.










 Female Sexual Dysfunction and Disease Mongering 

DSM 5 will give drug companies running room to continue their disease mongering of female sexual disorders- hyping questionable DSM ills as a means of pushing pills.









DSM 5 Confirms That Rape Is Crime, Not Mental Disorder

DSM-5 has rejected rape as a mental disorder. This should reduce the inaccurate use of psychiatric diagnosis to justify the longterm involuntary commitment of sexually violent predators who have already served their full prison sentence. Inappropriately using psychiatric diagnosis in the service of preventive detention is a slippery slope with disastrous consequences.









The Power of Sexual Selection

Sexual selection has powerfully influenced psychology and psychology has powerfully influenced evolution.










Who Was the Greatest Psychologist?

Darwin's evolutionary approach to human psychology is the foundation of all later developments. 









 A New Blog Title and a New Mission: 'Saving Normal'

Now that DSM 5 is in press, my new mission is saving normal.









Price Gouging: Why Will DSM-5 Cost $199 a Copy?

DSM-5 is pricing itself out of the market at $200 a copy. I explain the forces leading to this price gouging and why it won't work.









Bad News: DSM 5 Refuses to Correct Somatic Symptom Disorder

DSM 5 will inappropriately label as mentally ill 1 in 6 people with cancer and heart disease; 1 in 4 with irritable bowel and fibromyalgia; and 1 in 14 who are not even medically ill. DSM 5 rejected the simple wording changes I suggested that would have helped correct this problem.










Pragmatism In Psychiatric Diagnosis

This is a response to Dr Ghaemi's claim that DSM IV and DSM 5 both suffer from excessive pragmatism. Psychiatric diagnosis must be pragmatic. DSM 5 suffers from not being pragmatic enough.

The benzos are dangerously seductive – easy and pleasant to start, but frequently addictive and almost impossible to stop. They do little good and cause much harm. 









 Trump Is Breaking Bad, Not Clinically Mad

Although Trump has an outsized personality, he doesn't have the distress or impairment required for Personality Disorder. Trump causes both in others.









US Mental Health Care Goes from the Worst To Even Worse

Great new report documents the terrible shortage in US funding for mental health and that we are criminalizing the severely ill.









Religious Freedom Shouldn't Trump Other Civil Rights

Religious freedom is an important right, but isn't absolute when it violates the rights and dignity of others or the legitimate interests of public policy.

 The DEA Has The Wrong Priorities And Kratom Is The Wrong Target

 What To Do When Treatment Doesn't Work

 The Perils Of Polypharmacy


Polypharmacy was once the exception in psychiatry, now it seems to have become the rule. Patients frequently are taking 3,4, even 5 psych meds at one time. And often it's primary care doctors, not psychiatrists, who are doing the prescribing -- usually without adequate training in psychiatry.

 Balancing Patient Freedom With Safety And Well Being


I have always hated involuntary psychiatric treatment. It is demeaning to human dignity, subject to abuse, and extremely unpleasant both to experience and to recommend. But there are rare times when pressuring someone into treatment becomes the lesser evil, preferable to the risks of suicide, violence, jail or homelessness.

 Can DSM-5 Correct Its Mistakes? I Say No, DSM-5 Says Yes


It is now almost three years since DSM-5 was published; time enough to judge whether it is living up to the promise that it would be a self correcting, "living document." To its credit, APA did establish a mechanism to identify DSM-5 errors and to correct them.

 Psychiatric Medicines Are Not All Good or All Bad


Far too many people who need drugs don't take them -- either because treatment is unavailable or because they don't realize or accept the fact that they need it. So we are trapped in the cruel, dumb, and sometimes tragic paradox that the wrong people often take meds, while the right ones don't.

 The Social Cure For Mental Illness


As Aristotle pointed out, we are social animals who can be fully human only when interacting with others. In the US, we worsen the symptoms of our mentally ill by neglecting their needs and excluding them from society. Fortunately, the reciprocal is also true -- we can heal by simple human acts of caring and inclusion.
