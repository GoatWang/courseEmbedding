Page Content​Exelon's suppliers are committed to the environment, safety, diversity and transparency. The right business partners help create results that are off the charts. 


Exelon believes in seamless, transparent supply chain solutions. We welcome new suppliers that can help us meet our daily demands, future requirements, and support our emergency response efforts with innovative solutions. 






HTML ContentExelon believes in a green, sustainable supply chain.We were the first U.S.-based utility to join the Carbon Disclosure Project’s Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration, asking suppliers to voluntarily disclose GHG emissions and energy consumption. We’re also a founder of the Electric Utility Industry Sustainable Supply Chain Alliance. Our work includes the development of voluntary, consensus-based standards for evaluating the environmental attributes of key materials and services provided to the industry.Supplier diversity is a strategic goal.Diversity is an Exelon core value and a business imperative. In fact, achieving a diverse range of suppliers, vendors and service providers is among our formal, strategic goals. Exelon’s Supplier Diversity Program is designed to engage certified women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses and other businesses with recognized diversity classifications.Since 2010, the Exelon family of companies facilitated a half-billion dollars in corporate spending from certified diverse suppliers. In 2014, the number more than doubled to over a billion, demonstrating our commitment to the goal.
Learn more about diversity and inclusion at ExelonThe Exelon culture demands safety-first suppliers.Exelon is committed to assuring safety at all times, and our Corporate Policy fosters a culture of safety. To protect the safety and health of our employees, contractors, customers and communities, we’ve implemented a number of initiatives to promote safe behaviors both on and off the job. Among them: we conduct rigorous safety training for employees, starting with their first day of orientation.Exelon expects our suppliers to have the same commitment to these standards.
Learn more about safety at Exelon Suppliers can also contribute to our culture of innovation.The energy industry is being transformed by new energy sources coming onto the grid from consumers who produce their own energy with rooftop solar panels and fuel cells. Add to that the potential of Web-based analysis and functions, the “Internet of Things,” mobile, cloud, social, even drones, and anything is possible.Exelon fosters a culture of innovation inside the company with initiatives like TechEXchange and Innovation Expos, and by encouraging and recognizing individual innovation efforts. We also look to form mutually beneficial partnerships outside Exelon with, for example, Constellation Technology Ventures.

Compensation as of Fiscal Year 2017. 

Exelon Generation Company, LLC Key Developments

Exelon Generation Company Reports Unaudited Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 3 17
Exelon Generation Company reported unaudited earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported GAAP net income of $423 million compared with $310 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings were $172 million compared with $315 million a year ago. The company’s adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings in the first quarter of 2017 decreased by $143 million compared with the same quarter in 2016, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impacts of declining natural gas prices on natural gas portfolio, increased nuclear outage days, decreased capacity prices and lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the impact of the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement in 2017.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
