"Alliance has helped my business grow with their quick response and affordable prices on hauling. I just contact Scott Whitford and he gets the job done. It's that simple." 
"Alliance delivered on a project that required special attention – four loads that needed to be picked up quickly because of weather conditions – the loads were dispatched, picked and delivered before promised date at great rates."
"The service Phil provides ACS is phenomenal and is very much valued as an extension to our business."
"Don always strives to accommodate our every need. He handles all the coordinating with our foremen and vendors to help ensure a smooth haul, and is always available beyond work hours and on weekends. One could not ask for a more dedicated, confident, or on-top-of-things guy to get the job done!"
"Greg Ferr's expertise in his field, knowledge of heavy equipment, and commitment to get the job done in a timely manner is a great asset to our company in getting everything on site by the start up date required. We will definitely be using Alliance Trucking Inc. for our future hauling needs."
I highly recommend Karla Craft at Alliance Trucking when it comes to getting your freight shipped. For the past 5 years, she has provided me with excellent customer service and professionalism. She gets the job done quickly and communicates with precision.
