RBC Correspondent Services is a division of RBC Capital Markets, LLC, member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC.  RBC Capital Markets, LLC is a member of the NYSE, AMEX, CHX, CBOE and PSE and has execution capabilities on all principal exchanges.  RBC Capital Markets, LLC is owned by Royal Bank of Canada, which trades under the symbol RY on the New York Stock Exchange.
 About RBC Log In
Alexander Capital, L.P. has a contractual agreement with RBC Correspondent Services to serve as our Clearing Firm.  This fully disclosed agreement states the responsibilities of each party.  Prior to the agreement becoming effective, RBC is responsible for making all disclosures to our firm’s designated examining authority as required by NYSE Rule 382.  Each client is notified to the relationship via a disclosure letter.  The disclosure letter details the responsibilities that our firm, Alexander Capital, L.P., and RBC has to the client.  Although client assets are held by RBC Capital Markets, LLC, neither RBC Capital Markets, LLC nor RBC Correspondent Services has responsibility for the financial condition or performance of Alexander Capital, L.P. or our Financial Advisors.
SIPC & Additional Coverage for Client Accounts
Our Clearing Firm, RBC Correspondent Services, is a division of RBC Capital Markets, LLC.  RBC Capital Markets, LLC is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC is a nonprofit membership corporation funded by its member security broker-dealers.  SIPC protects the securities clients of its members in the event of the failure of a member firm.  SIPC reimburses clients the cash value of their securities up to $500,000 per client.  Any cash in a client’s account would be reimbursed by SIPC up to $250,000 (reducing the $500,000 above).
RBC Capital Markets, LLC has purchased an additional policy that offers coverage in excess of the protection provided by SIPC.  This Policy covers additional securities and cash protection up to $99.5 million per client, of which $900,000 may be in cash.  A $400 million aggregate limit applies to this additional coverage.
RBC Capital Markets, LLC also offers protection if a client’s securities are missing because of theft by an outsider, computer fraud, or an employee for personal gain.  In such cases, the Firm’s CAN$310 Million Financial Institution Bond Coverage would cover the client’s losses, subject to that policy’s terms, conditions and limits.
Note:  Neither SIPC protection, nor protection in excess of that offered by SIPC, covers a decline in the value of a client’s assets due to market loss.  Additional information is available upon request or at www.sipc.org.

History 
Why Alexander 
Open Architecture 
Work with Us 








HISTORY
Founded in 1995, Alexander Capital, L.P.  is now under new ownership and has become a full service investment bank and brokerage  firm backed by a team of talented and experienced industry professionals. The core of the Firm’s Principals and Executives reflects a broad background in investment banking, sales and trading.
Established in 1995
Headquartered in New York City
Full-service boutique brokerage firm
Investment Banking, capital raising, advisory and valuation services
Retail and Institutional Sales and Trading
Investment Advisory Services offered through Alexander Capital Wealth Management
Insurance offered through Alexander Capital Insurance Agency
Alexander Capital, L.P. is a member of FINRA & SIPC
Clearing agent is RBC Correspondent Services





WHY ALEXANDER
Alexander Capital is an advisory practice offering full service investment banking and wealth management services.  Our firm is built on the principles of client needs and solutions and not product development and distribution.  The large banks and brokerage firms build products that fill what consultants tell them clients need.  We build what the client needs or go on a unbiased search process to deliver the best solution.





WHAT IS OPEN ARCHITECTURE
“Open architecture allows us to provide a true advisory model to our clients.  Large banks and trust companies have a shelf of products approved for a bucket of clients.  We cater investments and structures that fit each client.  It may be a larger bank product or most likely one that is unique and not widely offered.  We have the ability to study and examine a much larger sub set of what a client needs. Once you look past the walls of a large bank you can see the entire forest.”
-Ross Bevevino
 Managing Director





WORK WITH US
Without our people and the ability to attract and retain talent, we would not be successful as a business able to support our corporate and investor clientele.  We believe in the development and retention of long-term employees beginning with our internship program and the recruitment and of the best investment professionals we can find.    Below is a sample of positions we have hired in the past year.

ACLP Business Continuity Plan Disclosure Summary - Alexander Capital L.P.Alexander Capital L.P. - Investment Portfolio Management


































































Investment Banking & Advisory







Equity Sales & Trading







Wealth Management







Team & Approach








Alexander Capital LP has a Business Continuity Plan describing how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information regarding our business continuity plan. Contacting Us If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at 212-687-5650 you should access our website at www.alexandercapitallp.com for an alternative telephone number and/or email address. If you cannot access us through either of those means, you should contact our clearing firm, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, at 1-866-223-8805 or www.rbc-cs.com for instructions on how the disruption will affect your prompt access to your account.
Our Business Continuity Plan We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Our business continuity plan addresses: data back-up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counterparty impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business. Our clearing firm, RBC Capital Markets, LLC. backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by our clearing firm that its objective is to restore its own operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new transactions and payments within 4 hours. Your orders and requests for funds and securities could be delayed during this period. Varying Disruptions Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within a reasonable time period. In a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and recover and resume business within a reasonable time period. In either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to our clearing firm if necessary, and notify you through our website www.alexandercapital.com, by telephone, or by email. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customer’s prompt access to their funds and securities.
For More Information
If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at:  Telephone: 212-687-5650 Email: info@alexandercapitallp.com
