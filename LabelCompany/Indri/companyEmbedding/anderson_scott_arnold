What are analysts saying about Cirrus Logic stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Cirrus Logic stock: 
1. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "We recently hosted a series of investor meetings with Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode and met with executives at MWC in Barcelona. Despite initial F2018 top-line guidance well below consensus largely due to slower non-Apple digital/ANC headset adoption, interest from investors was strong and focused on areas of potential guidance conservatism and expanding content long-term in several segments with new 55nm boosted amplifier and first voice biometics products of keen interest. While we concede near-term sales growth will likely be slower versus recent 25%+ growth, especially with ~70% content growth in iPhone last year, we believe F’18 guidance will prove conservative given iPhone unit growth and potential mid- tier Android codec/amplifier growth. While some investors have voiced concerns F’17 could mark peak earnings growth for the company, we disagree and believe our positive long-term thesis is very much intact given we believe Cirrus’ leading portfolio of audio codec, amplifier and MEMS microphone products — the complete audio value chain — is well positioned to yield strong sales and earnings growth driven by 1) further potential long-term content gains with Cirrus’ top customer in microphones, headsets and voice biometrics, 2) high- and mid-tier Android share expansion, 3) digital/ANC headset leadership, 4) an emerging MEMS microphone franchise, 5) leading R&D against voice biometic security applications and 6) long-term growth of audio sales into emerging IoT markets." (3/6/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "After growing 30% Y/Y the last three fiscal years and posting a strong finish through the end of the year, we are moderating our FY18 revenue growth assumptions down to 6% Y/Y. Unlike last year we don't expect dollar content gains at Apple this year, and hence the Apple business will primarily be driven by higher sell through units, which could provide upside to the guidance range. Moreover, CRUS provided a higher guidance for its long-term operating margin range at ~mid-20s and a lower tax rate of 22-24%, which is actually driving upside to our fiscal Non-GAAP EPS. Net, we are increasing our PT to $70 based on a P/E of 14.6x (ex-cash) on our new FY18 estimates of $4.50. With the stock likely to trade down, we would be buyers on weakness." (2/2/2017)

The company's products, sold under its own name and the Crystal product brand, enable system-level applications in mass storage, audio and precision data conversion.

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 3 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.58)Consensus Price Target: $69.18 (9.22% upside)
