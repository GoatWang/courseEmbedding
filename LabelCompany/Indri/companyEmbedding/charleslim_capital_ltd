INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY




									We prioritise the independence to manage capital according to our core principles:
							
I. INVESTING IN TOMORROW’S WORLD

									We seek to invest in the best businesses in the context of the world economy of the future. Such businesses often have significant presence in Asia, and are in solid industries that benefit from economic, technological, demographic and social transitions that continue to shape the world.  Our bias is towards investing in and partnering with companies that we regard as “Blue Chips of Tomorrow”.
							
II. CONCENTRATED INVESTING FOR THE LONG-TERM

			    				We seek to invest like business owners. We focus capital on our best ideas through careful selection of businesses and limiting the number of investments. Our long-term approach enables us to invest effectively through industry cycles; business that are built to last devalue little from a year or two of turmoil, often gaining sustainable advantages instead. In our view, short-term uncertainties often create longer-term opportunities for the far-sighted and patient investor with holding power.
							
III. FUNDAMENTAL DISCIPLINE

									We seek out value, preferably deep value, and quality at all times. We undertake intensive, focused and on-the-ground research for a deep understanding of the industries, countries and companies that we invest in. Downside risks are evaluated as much as upside potential, and capital preservation is paramount. We undertake independent and sensible analysis for superior understanding and conviction regardless of consensus opinion.
IV. INDEPENDENT AND ORIGINAL THINKING 

									Independent perspectives and thought leadership in the areas of relevance to our investments are core to our strategy.  Many of the best investment opportunities may lie in quality companies that are under-researched or misunderstood, that are in transition and not well-suited to be valued by public markets or that require non-standard assessments of valuation and its future prospects.
							
V. PARTNERSHIP AND CO-INVESTMENT

									We seek genuine long-term partnerships and relationships with investee companies and clients.  We are focused on managing long-term capital and generally do not employ leverage in investing, to enable us to capture long-term opportunities especially in time of pessimism or market dislocations, and to have superior holding power.
							





		    					”... the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about ... It is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence ...”
		    				

		    					John Maynard Keynes

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
