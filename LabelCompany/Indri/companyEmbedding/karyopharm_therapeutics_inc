Overview
Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovery and development and subsequent commercialization of novel first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear transport and related targets for the treatment of cancer and other major diseases.
Our scientific expertise is focused on understanding the regulation of intracellular communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing novel, small molecule Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export, or SINE™, compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein XPO1. These SINE™ compounds represent a new class of drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action that have the potential to treat a variety of diseases in areas of unmet medical need. Our SINE™ compounds were the first oral XPO1 inhibitors in clinical development.
Our lead drug candidate, selinexor (KPT-330), is an XPO1 inhibitor being evaluated in multiple late stage clinical trials in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematological and solid tumor malignancies.
XPO1 mediates the export of over 220 different cargo proteins, including the vast majority of tumor suppressor proteins.  We believe that no currently approved or current clinical-stage experimental cancer drug candidates are selectively targeting the restoration and increase in the levels of multiple tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus.
Our other drug candidates in development include oral verdinexor (KPT-335) as an anti-viral agent, as well as a treatment for cancer in companion dogs, oral KPT-350 as a treatment for neurological, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, KPT-8602 as a treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and our oral dual PAK4/NAMPT inhibitor, KPT-9274, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
XPO1-inhibiting SINE™ compounds that we have discovered and developed to date, including selinexor, have the potential to provide a novel targeted therapy that enable tumor suppressor proteins to remain in the nucleus and promote apoptosis of cancer cells and we believe that our SINE™ compounds have the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in a number of additional indications, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, wound healing, HIV and influenza.
In addition to our SINE™ compounds, we also investigate XPO1 cargo proteins and their role in the cell cycle and cell division. As part of this investigation, we have identified several XPO1 cargo proteins whose inhibition leads to the selective death of cancer cells. One of the XPO1 cargo proteins that we identified was p21-activated kinase 4, or PAK4. PAK4 is member of the PAK family of kinases that includes 6 proteins, PAK1-6. PAK4-6 belong to a growth-promoting sub-family. PAK4 is a signaling protein regulating numerous fundamental cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cellular division, cell shape and motility, cell survival, immune defense and the development of cancer. PAK4 interacts with many key signaling molecules involved in cancer such as beta-catenin, CDC42, Raf-1, BAD and myosin light chain. Based on this biology, we used our drug discovery and optimization expertise to identify small molecule modulators of PAK4. Our PAK4 allosteric modulators have shown broad evidence of anti-cancer activity against hematological and solid tumor malignant cells while showing minimal toxicity to normal cells in vitro. In mouse and rat xenograft studies, our PAK4 inhibitors given orally have shown evidence of anti-cancer activity and tolerability. To our knowledge, we are the only company with a pre-IND allosteric, PAK4 specific inhibitor.
Recently, we identified an additional target for our clinical candidate KPT-9274 known as NAMPT (Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; also known as PBEF or Visfatin). NAMPT is a pleiotropic protein with intra- and extra-cellular functions as an enzyme, cytokine, growth factor, and hormone that can be found in complex with PAK4 in the cell. NAMPT is of interest as an oncology target because it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in one of the two intracellular salvage pathways that generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. NAD is a universal energy- and signal-carrying molecule involved in mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, antioxidation, and paradoxically generation of oxidative stress, gene expression, immunological functions, aging, and cell death.
In addition, we are investigating a SINE™ compound for cancer in companion dogs, both as a surrogate model for human malignancies and as a potential treatment for cancers in dogs. It is widely known that canine lymphomas respond to chemotherapy similarly to their human counterpart (human NHL) and display a comparable genetic profile. Lymphomas are one of the most common tumors in pet dogs. Lymphoma in dogs is very aggressive and, without treatment, the tumors are often fatal within weeks.  The majority of dog lymphomas are DLBCL and most of the others are T-cell lymphomas. Given the similarities between dog and human lymphomas, prior to initiating clinical trials of selinexorin humans, we investigated a closely-related, orally available SINE™, verdinexor, in dogs with lymphomas.
Verdinexor has received a Minor Use / Minor Species, or MUMS, designation from the Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, of the FDA for the treatment of lymphomas in canines.

To our knowledge, we are the only company with a pre-IND allosteric, PAK4 specific inhibitor.
Recently, we identified an additional target for our clinical candidate KPT-9274 known as NAMPT (Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; also known as PBEF or Visfatin). NAMPT is a pleiotropic protein with intra- and extra-cellular functions as an enzyme, cytokine, growth factor, and hormone that can be found in complex with PAK4 in the cell. NAMPT is of interest as an oncology target because it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in one of the two intracellular salvage pathways that generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. NAD is a universal energy- and signal-carrying molecule involved in mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, antioxidation, and paradoxically generation of oxidative stress, gene expression, immunological functions, aging, and cell death.
In addition, we are investigating a SINE™ compound for cancer in companion dogs, both as a surrogate model for human malignancies and as a potential treatment for cancers in dogs. It is widely known that canine lymphomas respond to chemotherapy similarly to their human counterpart (human NHL) and display a comparable genetic profile. Lymphomas are one of the most common tumors in pet dogs. Lymphoma in dogs is very aggressive and, without treatment, the tumors are often fatal within weeks.  The majority of dog lymphomas are DLBCL and most of the others are T-cell lymphomas. Given the similarities between dog and human lymphomas, prior to initiating clinical trials of selinexorin humans, we investigated a closely-related, orally available SINE™, verdinexor, in dogs with lymphomas.
Verdinexor has received a Minor Use / Minor Species, or MUMS, designation from the Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, of the FDA for the treatment of lymphomas in canines.

(Nasdaq:KPTI), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Division of Hematology Products has lifted the partial clinical hold placed on the clinical trials for selinexor (KPT-330), enabling patient enrollment and dosing of new patients in the Company’s clinical trials of selinexor in hematological malignancies.  The partial clinical hold was not the result of any patient death or any change in the safety profile of selinexor.  Enrollment may now resume in all selinexor studies in hematologic malignancies, including the STORM study in refractory multiple myeloma, the SADAL study in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and the STOMP study of selinexor and backbone therapies in multiple myeloma.  In addition, Investigator Sponsored Trials in hematologic malignancies with selinexor may resume accruing patients. Michael G. Kauffman, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Karyopharm, stated, “The Karyopharm team worked diligently to update and submit the required documents to the FDA, which allowed the hematology divison to expeditiously remove the partial clinical hold.  We anticipate that the solid tumor divisions will follow suit shortly.  Patient enrollment is again underway in our hematologic oncology studies.  Our previously disclosed enrollment rates and timelines for both ongoing and planned trials are not expected to be materially impacted.” About Selinexor Selinexor (KPT-330) is a first-in-class, oral Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE™ compound. Selinexor functions by binding with and inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO1 (also called CRM1), leading to the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins in the cell nucleus. This reinitiates and amplifies their tumor suppressor function and is believed to lead to the selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, while largely sparing normal cells. To date, over 1,900 patients have been treated with selinexor and it is currently being evaluated in several mid- and later-phase clinical trials across multiple cancer indications, including in multiple myeloma in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (STORM) and backbone therapies (STOMP), and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SADAL), and liposarcoma (SEAL), among others. Karyopharm plans to initiate a pivotal randomized Phase 3 study of selinexor in combination with bortezomib (Velcade®) and low-dose dexamethasone (BOSTON) in patients with multiple myeloma in early 2017. Additional Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are ongoing or currently planned, including multiple studies in combination with one or more approved therapies in a variety of tumor types to further inform the Company's clinical development priorities for selinexor. Additional clinical trial information for selinexor is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Karyopharm Therapeutics Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:KPTI) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear transport and related targets for the treatment of cancer and other major diseases. Karyopharm's SINE™ compounds function by binding with and inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO1 (or CRM1). In addition to single-agent and combination activity against a variety of human cancers, SINE™ compounds have also shown biological activity in models of neurodegeneration, inflammation, autoimmune disease, certain viruses and wound-healing. Karyopharm, which was founded by Dr. Sharon Shacham, currently has several investigational programs in clinical or preclinical development. For more information, please visit www.karyopharm.com. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include those regarding the anticipated impact of the partial clinical hold, the potential timing for the removal of the partial clinical hold by the solid tumor divisions of the FDA, therapeutic potential of and potential clinical development plans for Karyopharm's drug candidates, including the timing of initiation of and enrollment in certain trials. Such statements are subject to numerous important factors, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events or results to differ materially from the Company's current expectations. For example, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will release the partial clinical hold in a timely manner or at all, any of Karyopharm's SINE™ compounds, including selinexor (KPT-330), will successfully complete necessary preclinical and clinical development phases or that development of any of Karyopharm's drug candidates will continue. Further, there can be no guarantee that any positive developments in Karyopharm's drug candidate portfolio will result in stock price appreciation. Management's expectations and, therefore, any forward-looking statements in this press release could also be affected by risks and uncertainties relating to a number of other factors, including the following: Karyopharm's results of clinical trials and preclinical studies, including subsequent analysis of existing data and new data received from ongoing and future studies; the content and timing of decisions made by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, investigational review boards at clinical trial sites and publication review bodies, including with respect to the need for additional clinical studies; Karyopharm's ability to obtain and maintain requisite regulatory approvals and to enroll patients in its clinical trials; unplanned cash requirements and expenditures; development of drug candidates by Karyopharm's competitors for diseases in which Karyopharm is currently developing its drug candidates; and Karyopharm's ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and other intellectual property protection for any drug candidates it is developing. These and other risks are described under the caption "Risk Factors" in Karyopharm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 16, 2017, and in other filings that Karyopharm may make with the SEC in the future. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof, and Karyopharm expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
