That is what he was referring to. It wasn't my fault the shut off valve wouldn't solder correctly, event he home Depot guy said it happens every once in a while.

The reason the blue pex was put on the hot is because he said they were backwards, so I changed them.

He also neglected to say that the previous contractor screw up almost everything. Did I charge him for the mistakes the other contractor made? No I didn't.  I corrected them myself." - Mike MorrisonTop questions to ask yourself before hiring a pro1. What is the scope of the project?A professional will assist you with scope and estimates, but having a clear idea of what you want to accomplish will help communication.2. How involved in the project do I want to be?Do you want professionals to do everything, or do you have the time and skill to do some of the work?3. Can I do some parts of the project myself?Many projects such as have a DIY component, such as painting or cleanup.4. Are the pros I'm considering hiring Licensed, Bonded, and Insured?First and foremost, protect yourself and make sure the contractor and any sub-contractors are registered, licensed, bonded and insured.Recent reviews for Royal Oak drapery installation servicesReview for:Morrison Home Maintenance, LLC 01/07/2016What Richard Kristen stated was not an accurate accounting of what transpired. he neglected to say that the paneling is bowed, that is incorrect.  the shut off valves where the vanity was supposed to be installed failed when soldered in place.
