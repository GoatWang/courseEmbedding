adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying

condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of only normal

recurring adjustments.� The results of operations presented in the

accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months

ended March 31, 2002 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be

expected for the full year ending December 31, 2002.
�
Net Loss per Common Share
�
Basic

loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common

stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.� Unvested common shares are considered to be

stock options for purposes of computing loss per share and are not included in

the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.� Diluted loss per common share is computed by

dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average

number of common shares and dilutive potential common share equivalents

outstanding. Potential common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon

the exercise of stock options and warrants.
�
As of

March 31, 2002, there were options and warrants outstanding to purchase

1,925,403 shares of common stock and 400,000 unvested shares of common stock

that were not included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as their

effect would have been anti�dilutive, thereby decreasing the loss per

common share.
�
NOTE 2 � BUSINESS CONDITION
�
Since

inception, the Company has suffered recurring losses. During the year ended

December 31, 2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002, the Company had

losses of� $2,444,411 and $589,480, respectively. During the year ended

December 31, 2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002, the Company�s

operations used $1,725,729 and $585,025 of cash, respectively. These matters raise

substantial doubt about the Company�s ability to continue as a going concern.

Management is attempting to raise debt and equity financing for use in

operations. In February 2002, the Company completed a private placement

offering by issuing 2,723,139 shares of common stock for net proceeds of

$1,364,034.� Although the Company

presently intends to conduct a private placement of common stock towards the

end of the second quarter of 2002, if market conditions permit, the realization

of additional financing is not assured.
�
The

accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to

the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount

and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be

unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE

3 � INVESTMENT IN RSi BRE, INC.
�
RSi

BRE, Inc. (�RSi BRE�) is a wholly-owned, bankrupt-remote subsidiary of the

Company that holds and operates 2,050 Refreshment Center Units and has an

obligation to RSG Investments LLC (�RSG�) as a result of a troubled debt

restructuring under the terms of an Equipment Transfer Agreement with RSG. The

Refreshment Center Units are subject to seven-year revenue sharing agreements

held by RSi BRE.� Under the terms of the

Equipment Transfer Agreement, RSG receives $0.57 per unit per day of the

revenue from the revenue sharing agreements, if earned, which is applied to the

obligation to RSG.� The obligation to

RSG is being amortized over the remaining life of the revenue sharing

agreements using an estimated effective interest rate of approximately

41%.� This rate could fluctuate in the

future depending upon the level and timing of revenues generated from the

Refreshment Center Units.
�
The

board of directors of RSi BRE is comprised of one appointee from the Company,

one appointee from RSG and one independent appointee. All operating decisions,

including disbursements, of RSi BRE require unanimous consent of RSi BRE�s

board of directors. As a result, the Company does not control RSi BRE. In

accordance with EITF 96-16, �Investor�s Accounting for an Investee When the

Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest But the Minority Shareholder or

Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights,� the Company has determined

that RSi BRE does not qualify for consolidation in the Company�s financial

statements. Rather, the Company�s investment in RSi BRE is reflected as an

�Investment in Wholly Owned, Unconsolidated Subsidiary� in the accompanying

consolidated balance sheet and is being accounted for under the equity method

of accounting.

At

March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the assets and liabilities of RSi BRE

NOTE 4 � COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
�
Legal Matters
�
On

March�28, 2001, the Company received a letter from the Company�s former

chairman and chief executive officer, in which he claims he is due certain

severance and other payments in the aggregate amount of approximately

$1,700,000 pursuant to the terms of his terminated employment agreement.� The matter has been submitted to binding

arbitration per the terms of the terminated employment agreement.� Although the resolution of the claim is not

expected to have a material effect on the Company�s financial position or

future results of operations, there is no assurance that the results of the

binding arbitration will be favorable to the Company.� In the event that the arbitrator finds in favor of the former

chairman and chief executive officer, the Company may be exposed to a liability

of up to approximately $1,700,000, the amount claimed by the former chairman

and chief executive officer.� The

arbitration hearing scheduled for February 2002 was postponed at the request of

the former chairman and chief executive officer and has not been rescheduled.
�
The

Company is also the subject of certain legal matters, which it considers

incidental to its business activities. It is the opinion of management that the

ultimate disposition of these legal matters should not have a material impact

on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the

Company.
�
NOTE

5 � STOCKHOLDERS� EQUITY
�
In

February 2002, the Company issued 2,723,139 shares of common stock in a private

placement. The shares were valued at $0.52 per share before offering costs and

commissions. The net proceeds from the private placement, after offering costs

and commissions totaled $1,364,034, which included the non-cash settlement of

$66,429 of accounts payable.
�
Under

the terms of the private placement, the Company is obligated to include the

common shares issued in any registration filed by the Company within one year

of the date the common shares are issued.�

After one year the related stockholders have the right to demand that

the common shares be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

and if demanded, the cost of the registration shall be borne by the Company.
�
On

December 31, 2001, officers (and a related entity owned by a director to whom

an officer assigned 300,000 options), directors and a non-employee consultant

exercised options to purchase 950,000 shares of common stock (including 636,578

variable options) at $0.26 per share under the terms of options granted on

December 31, 2001, by payment of $26,000 in February 2002 and by issuing

$221,000 of 5% full-recourse promissory notes to the Company. Principal and

accrued interest on the promissory notes is due on December 31, 2005. In

addition to the shares purchased with the notes, the notes are secured by

637,500 shares of common stock that were held by the officers or the related

entity for more than six months at the date of exercise and by other assets.
�
9






�
The

options exercised on December 31, 2001 included the early exercise of 400,000

unvested options. The common shares issued upon the early exercise are subject to contingent

repurchase call options held by the Company that will lapse at the time, and to

the extent, the options vest.� The

options vest through December 31, 2002. The Company may exercise the repurchase

call option on the unvested portion of the common shares if the related officer

terminates employment with the Company prior to the date the related options vest.

Each call option is exercisable at the lesser of the fair value of the common

stock on the date exercised or $0.26 per share. The unvested common shares

issued upon the early exercise of the options have been included in common

stock outstanding from December 31, 2001.
�
NOTE 6 � STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
�
Tender

Offer and Variable Options
�
On January 7,
2002, the Company offered to exchange all options held by current employees,

directors, independent sales representatives and key consultants to purchase

shares of the Company�s common stock with an exercise price per share of $1.50

or more for new options to be granted under the Company�s 2000 Stock Option and

Incentive Plan. Under the terms of the tender offer, the new options will be

granted on or promptly after the first trading day that is at least six months

and one day after the date the tendered options were accepted for exchange and

cancelled.� The exercise price of the

new options will be equal to the closing market price of the common stock on

the date of grant. Each new option will preserve the vesting schedule and the

vesting commencement date of the option it replaces, if any, so that on the

date the new option is granted and on any date thereafter, the holder will be

vested in the new option to the same extent they would have been vested on that

date had they retained their tendered option. As a result of the tender offer,

options to purchase 1,367,855 shares of common stock exercisable from $1.51 to

$9.60 per share were cancelled during January 2002 and the Company is obligated

to grant new options in July 2002 for the purchase of 1,367,855 shares of

common stock exercisable at the market price on the date they are granted,

subject to the continued employment of the respective option holders on such

date. 89,961 of these exchanged options had been accounted for under FAS 123

and had fair value of $152,271, which has been recorded as

additional paid-in capital.
�
In accordance with

FAS Interpretation No. 44, the Company indirectly reduced the fixed exercise

price of options to purchase 736,703 shares by canceling those options in

January 2002 in connection with the tender offer and by granting on December

31, 2001 options to the same persons to purchase 736,703 shares at lower

exercise prices.� As a result, the

options will be accounted for as variable options until they are exercised,

forfeited or expire. On December 31, 2001, officers (and a related entity owned

by a director), exercised options to purchase 636,578 shares leaving options to

purchase 100,125 shares to be accounted for as variable options.� During the three months ended March 31,
2002, the Company recognized compensation expense relating to the variable

options of $96,615.
�
Stock

Options and Warrants
�
During the three

months ended March 31, 2002, the Company granted options to purchase 695 shares

of common stock to certain sales employees of the Company.� These options vested immediately and are

exercisable at $1.55 per share through March 2012.
�
During the three

months ended March 31, 2002, warrants to purchase 57,522 shares of common stock

expired.
�
At March 31, 2002,

the Company had 1,925,403 options and warrants outstanding, of which 1,758,742

were exercisable at an average exercise price of $4.43 per share.

ITEM 2.� MANAGEMENT�S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
�
The following discussion

should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to our

financial statements, included elsewhere in this report.� This discussion contains forward-looking

statements that involve risks and uncertainties.� Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated

in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors discussed

elsewhere in this report.
�
Certain information

included herein contains statements that may be considered forward-looking

statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as

amended, or the Securities Act, and Section�21E of the Securities Exchange

Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, such as statements relating to

our anticipated revenues, gross margin and operating results, future

performance and operations, plans for future expansion, capital spending, sources

of liquidity and financing sources.�

Such forward-looking information involves important risks and

uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the

future, and accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking

statements made herein.� These risks and

uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to our liquidity

requirements, the continued growth of the lodging industry, the success of our

product-development, marketing and sales activities, vigorous competition in

the lodging industry, dependence on existing management, leverage and debt

service (including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates), domestic or

global economic conditions, the inherent uncertainty and costs of prolonged

arbitration or litigation, and changes in federal or state tax laws or the

administration of such laws.� A complete

discussion of these risks and uncertainties are contained in our Annual Report

on Form 10-KSB, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April

1, 2002.
�
OVERVIEW
�
eRoomSystem Technologies,

Inc. is a Nevada corporation incorporated on August�31, 1999.� We have developed and introduced to the

lodging industry an intelligent, in-room computerized platform and

communications network, or the eRoomSystem.�

The eRoomSystem is a computerized platform and processor-based system

that is installed within our eRoomServ refreshment centers and designed to

collect and control data.� The

eRoomSystem also supports our eRoomSafe, an electronic in�room safe.� As part of our expanding line of products,

we announced eRoomTray, an in-room ambient tray that can sell a wide variety of

products at room temperature, and eRoomEnergy, an in-room digital thermostat

that is designed to control virtually any fan coil unit or packaged-terminal

air conditioner found in hotel rooms.�

We also intend to develop other applications and extensions to the

eRoomSystem, including information management services and direct credit card

billing and remote engineering and maintenance services.
�
ACCOUNTING

POLICIES
�
The preparation of

financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting

principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that

affect reported amounts and disclosures, some of which may require revision in

future periods.� The most sensitive

estimates affecting our financial statements include future volatility used in

valuing equity instruments, allowance for bad debts, depreciable lives of

refreshment centers in service and property and equipment, amortization life of

patents, deferred maintenance revenue and accrued liabilities.� By their nature, these judgments are subject

to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based on our historical

experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of industry trends,

information provided by or gathered from our customers and information

available from other outside sources, as appropriate. There can be no assurance

that actual results will not differ from our estimates.� The following is a summary of what

management believes are the critical accounting policies related to our

operations.� The application of
�
11






�
these policies, in

some cases, requires our management to make subjective judgments regarding the

effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
�
Description of Revenues
�
Historically, we have

received substantially all of our revenues from the sale or placement under a

revenue-sharing program of our products in hotels.� We expect that these revenues will account for a substantial

majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future.� We also generate limited revenues from maintenance and support

services.� Our dependence on the lodging

industry makes us vulnerable to downturns in the lodging industry caused by the

general economic environment.� Such a

downturn could result in some hotels delaying or declining to purchase or place

our products or failing to renew our maintenance agreements, or it could result

in fewer purchases by hotel guests of goods and services from our products

installed in hotels.� Time spent by

individuals on travel and leisure is typically discretionary for consumers and

may be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy.� The success of our operations depends, in

part, upon discretionary consumer spending and economic conditions affecting

disposable consumer income such as employment, wages and salaries, business

conditions, interest rates, availability of credit and taxation.
�
Through our

revenue-sharing program, we install our products at little or no upfront cost

to our customers and share in the recurring revenues generated from sales of

goods and services related to our products.�

We retain the ownership of the eRoomServ refreshment centers and

eRoomSafes throughout the term of the revenue-sharing agreements and the right

to re-deploy any systems returned to us upon the expiration or earlier

termination of the revenue-sharing agreements.�

We believe that our revenue-sharing program will increase future

placements of our products; however, we cannot assure you that we will be

successful in this effort.
�
We have experienced

substantial fluctuations in revenues from period-to-period as a result of

limited working capital to fund the development and assembly of our products

and to maintain sufficient component inventories.� In addition to limited working capital, fluctuations in revenues

have partially resulted from the transition to our revenue-sharing program

under which revenues are recognized over the seven-year life of the contract

instead of immediately upon installation of the product.� We anticipate that over the next several

years the majority of our revenues will result from the placement of our

products pursuant to our revenue-sharing program, followed by sales and, to a

lesser extent, from maintenance agreements.�

We project that we will receive approximately 60% of the recurring

revenues from the sale of goods and services generated by our eRoomServ

refreshment centers, eRoomSafes and eRoomTray solutions placed under the

revenue-sharing agreements.� Our

customers receive the remainder of the recurring revenues.� AMRESCO Leasing Corporation, or AMRESCO, has

agreed to finance up to 150% of the cost of our products placed under our

revenue-sharing program, subject to the satisfaction of funding requirements,

and, as a result, will be paid from our portion of the revenues.
�
Revenue Recognition
�
Sales revenue from our

products is recognized upon completion of installation and acceptance by the

customer.� Sales revenue from the

placement of our eRoomServ refreshment centers and eRoomSafes under our

revenue-sharing program are accounted for similar to an operating lease, with

the revenues recognized as earned over the term of the agreement.� In some instances, our revenue-sharing

agreements provide for a guaranteed minimum daily payment by the hotel.� We negotiate our portion of the revenues generated

under our revenue-sharing program based upon the cost of the equipment installed

and the estimated daily sales per unit for the specific customer.� We seek a gross profit margin of 40% on the

sale and placement through our revenue-sharing program of eRoomServ refreshment

centers and eRoomSafes.
�
We typically enter into

installation, maintenance and license agreements with our customers.� Installation, maintenance and license

revenues are recognized as the services are performed, or pro rata
�
12






�
over the service

period.� We defer all revenue paid in

advance relating to future services and products not yet installed and accepted

by our customers.
�
Description of Expenses
�
Cost of product sales

consists primarily of production, shipping and installation costs.� Cost of revenue-sharing arrangements

consists primarily of depreciation of capitalized costs for the products placed

in service.� We capitalize the

production, shipping, installation and sales commissions related to the

eRoomServ refreshment centers and eRoomSafes placed under revenue-sharing

agreements.� Cost of maintenance fee

revenues primarily consists of expenses related to customer support and

maintenance.
�
Selling, general and

administrative expenses include selling expenses consisting primarily of

advertising, promotional activities, trade shows, travel and personnel-related

expenses and general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of

professional fees, salaries and related costs for accounting, administration,

finance, human resources, information systems and legal personnel.
�
Research and development

expenses consist of payroll and related costs for hardware and software

engineers, quality assurance specialists, management personnel, and the costs

of materials used by these employees in the development of new or enhanced

product offerings.
�
In accordance with

Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No.�86, �Accounting for the Costs of

Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,� development costs

incurred in the research and development of new software products to be sold,

leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until technological

feasibility in the form of a working model has been established.� Internally generated capitalizable software

development costs have not been material to date.� We have charged our software development costs to research and

development expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
�
RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS
�
COMPARISON

OF THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2002 AND 2001
�
Revenues
�
Product Sales �� Revenues from product sales were $27,265 for

the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to $10,239 for the three months

ended March 31, 2002, representing a decrease of $17,026, or 62.4%.�� The decrease in revenues from product sales

was due to reduced sales of our products during the three months ended March

31, 2002 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2001.
�
Revenue Sharing

Arrangements � Our revenue from revenue sharing arrangements was $134,067 for

the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to $188,383 for the three

months ended March 31, 2002, representing an increase of $54,316, or

40.5%.� The increase in revenue from

revenue sharing arrangements was due primarily to the placement of an

additional 1,418 eRoomServ refreshment centers pursuant to our revenue-sharing

program during the twelve months ended March 31, 2002.
�
Maintenance Fee Revenues

� Our maintenance fee revenues were $56,403 for the three months ended March

31, 2001 and $54,989 for the three months ended March 31, 2002, representing a

decrease of $1,414, or 2.5%.� The

decrease was due primarily to the de-installation of our equipment from one

hotel property.
�
13






�
Cost of Revenue
�
Cost of Product Sales

Revenue � Our cost of product sales revenue for the three months ended March

31, 2001 was $15,650, compared to $1,226 for the three months ended March 31,
2002, a decrease of $14,424, or 92.1%.�

The decrease in costs was due to the decrease in product sales and the

availability of inventory-on-hand during the three months ended March 31,
2002.� The gross margin percentage on

revenue from product sales revenue was 42.6% for the three months ended March

31, 2001, compared to 88.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2002.
�
Cost of Revenue Sharing

Revenue � Our cost of revenue sharing revenue was $58,909 for the three months

ended March 31, 2001 and $94,868 during the three months ended March 31, 2002,

representing an increase of $35,959, or 61.0%.�

The increase in the cost of revenue sharing revenue was due to an

increased number of units placed pursuant to our revenue sharing program.� The gross margin percentage on revenue

sharing revenue was 56.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 49.6%

for the three months ended March 31, 2002.�

The decrease in gross margin percentage on revenue sharing revenue was

primarily due to increased cost of product mix under our revenue sharing agreements.
�
Cost of Maintenance

Revenue � Our cost of maintenance revenue was $140,329 for the three months

ended March 31, 2001 and $112,497 for the three months ended March 31, 2002,

representing a decrease of $27,832, or 19.8%.�

The gross margin percentage on maintenance revenues was (148.7%) for the

three months ended March 31, 2001 and (104.6%) for the three months ended March

31, 2002.� The decrease in our cost of

maintenance revenue and the reduction in the gross margin deficit percentage

were primarily due to the allocation of costs to a greater number of installed

units, offset, in part, by one-time repair costs of $35,000 associated with a

hotel property.

table summarizes the net changes and percent changes with respect to our

revenues and our cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2002 and

2001, the trends contained therein are limited and should not be viewed as a

definitive indication of our future results.
�

�
Operating Expenses
�
Selling, General and

Administrative � Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of

non-cash compensation expense, were $917,871 for the three months ended March

31, 2001 and $408,230 for the three months ended March 31, 2002, representing a

decrease of $509,641, or 55.5%.�

Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 421.6% of our

total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2001 compared to 160.9% of

our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2002.� The decrease in our selling, general and

administrative expenses reflects, in part, the reduced overhead related to our

restructurings in January 2001 and October 2001.
�
Research and Development

Expenses � Research and development expenses were $113,020� for the three months ended March 31, 2001

and $64,032 for the three months ended March 31, 2002, representing a decrease

of $48,988, or 43.3%.� Research and

development expenses represented 51.9% of our total revenue for the three

months ended March 31, 2001 and 25.2% of our total revenue for the three months

ended March 31, 2002.� The decrease in

research and development expenses was primarily due to the completion of the

research and development for our new windows-based platform and other products.
�
Non-Cash Compensation

Expense� � Non-cash compensation expense

was $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and $96,616 for the three

months ended March 31, 2002.� The

non-cash compensation expense recorded for the three months ended March 31,
2002 was due to the variable accounting for stock options issued on December

31, 2001 to certain of our employees, of which options to purchase 100,125

shares of our common stock remain unexercised and outstanding.
�
Other Expense, Net
�
Other expense was $6,059

for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and $65,622 for the three months

ended March 31, 2002, representing an increase of $59,563.� The increase was due primarily to the

increased interest expenses related to our borrowings pursuant to our financing

arrangement with AMRESCO and a decrease in our interest and other income.
�
Loss Attributable to

Common Stockholders
�
We incurred losses

attributable to common stockholders of $1,034,103 and $589,480 during the three

months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively.� The $444,623 decrease in the loss attributable to common

stockholders was due primarily to increased revenue, decreased cost of revenue

and decreased operating expenses, offset, in part, by increased other expense,

net.� We have continued to incur losses

subsequent to March 31, 2002 and, as a result, have experienced an increase in

accumulated deficit.� We believe that we

will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
�
LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
�
During the three months

ended March 31, 2002, our principal capital resources were our financial arrangement

with AMRESCO and the $1,416,029 in gross proceeds from our private placement of

common stock in March 2002.� During the

fiscal year 2001, we received $1,427,495 in fundings from AMRESCO and

anticipate future fundings of up to $250,000 during the three months ended June

30, 2002.� The funds from AMRESCO and

our private placement have been and will be used to fund working capital and

general corporate purposes.
�
At March�31, 2002,

our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,736,750 of cash and $2,211,798

of working capital compared to $1,031,232 of cash and $1,200,968 of working

capital at December 31, 2001.� In

addition, our stockholders� equity was $4,204,166 at March�31, 2002,

compared to stockholders� equity of $3,309,722 at December 31, 2001, an

increase of $894,444.� The increase in
�
15






�
cash, working

capital and stockholders� equity reflects the proceeds from our private

placement of common stock in March 2002, offset, in part, by the continued use

of cash by our operations and our current inability to generate sufficient

revenue to sustain our operations.
�
Our accumulated deficit

increased from $26,024,439 at March 31, 2001 to $28,024,227 at March�31,
2002.� The increase in accumulated deficit

resulted primarily from the net loss from operations for the nine months ended

December�31, 2001 and for the three months ended March�31, 2002.� We anticipate that our accumulated deficit

will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
�
We used net cash of

$672,553 of net cash used by operating activities during the three months ended

March, 2001, compared to $585,025 in operating activities during the three

months ended March 31, 2002.� The

$87,528 decrease in the use of net cash for operating activities primarily

resulted from the $444,623 decrease in net loss, offset, in part, by a $149,975

decrease in distributions in excess of equity from RSi BRE, Inc., a $305,049

decrease in net cash received from accounts receivable, a $224,948 decrease in inventories,

a $54,325 decrease in accounts payable, a $176,496 decrease in accrued

liabilities and a $534,782 decrease in customer deposits and deferred

maintenance revenue.
�
Investing activities for

the three months ended March 31, 2001 used net cash of $127,334, compared to

$24,633 provided during the three months ended March 31, 2002.� The increase in net cash provided by

investing activities resulted primarily $26,000 in� proceeds from payments on notes receivable from stockholders and

the $35,951 decrease in the purchase of property and equipment and the absence

of additions to refreshment centers in service.� Notwithstanding the increase in net cash provided by investing

activities, we expect our investing activity to increase in 2002 due to the

proposed increase in the placement of our products under our revenue-sharing

program.� Additionally, we anticipate

that we will experience a modest increase in our capital expenditures and lease

commitments for property and equipment consistent with anticipated growth in

operations, infrastructure and personnel.
�
Financing activities

provided $151,844 during the three months ended March 31, 2001 compared to net

cash of $1,265,910 provided during the three months ended March 31, 2002.� The primary source of cash during the three

months ended March 31, 2002 was our private placement of common stock for gross

proceeds of $1,416,029.� As a result,

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily

from $1,297,605 in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants,

offset in part by principal payments on notes payable and principal payments on

capital lease obligations.
�
The placement of products

under revenue-sharing arrangements is capital intensive.� We estimate that we must place approximately

16,000 units pursuant to our revenue-sharing program in order to become

profitable.� As of March�18, 2002,

we had 3,435 units placed pursuant to our revenue-sharing program.� Although we received proceeds from our

financing arrangement with AMRESCO and, in March 2002, from our private

placement of common stock, we will require additional cash to finance our

planned expansion and capital expenditures.�

The need for additional working capital is due, in part, to the 90-day

seasoning period prior to the receipt of funding from AMRESCO.� We are exploring financing alternatives that

may include institutional or other lending sources and private placements of

debt or equity.� There is no assurance

that we will be able to obtain additional financing in order to fund our

operations during the 90-day (or longer) seasoning period or that our customers

will meet the minimum performance criteria established by AMRESCO as a

pre-requisite to receiving any funding from AMRESCO.� If we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing to fund operations

during the 90-day (or longer) seasoning period or if we do not receive

sufficient financing from AMRESCO, we may have to shift more placements of our

units from revenue-sharing arrangements to product sales.� No assurance can be given that we will be

able to shift the placement of a sufficient number of our units from

revenue-sharing arrangements to product sales in order to provide adequate

liquidity.� Based on the foregoing, we

believe that we will have sufficient cash-on-hand and cash from future fundings

with AMRESCO to sustain our routine business operations (excluding capital

expenditures to meet our planned expansion) through the third quarter of
�
16






�
2002.� In addition, although we expect to raise

additional funds for working capital through private offerings of our equity or

convertible debt securities, we have no assurance that adequate funds will be

available on terms favorable to us, or at all.�

Further, although we presently intend to conduct a private placement of

common stock towards the end of the second quarter of 2002, if market

conditions permit, the realization of additional financing is not assured.� These matters raise substantial doubt about

our ability to continue as a going concern.

RECENT

DOWNTURNS IN THE AIRLINE, TRAVEL AND LODGING INDUSTRIES
�
Due to the weakening

economy and the events of September 11, 2001, the travel and lodging industries

have experienced unprecedented downturns.�

More specifically, the lodging industry has experienced lower hotel occupancy

rates due to reduced business and leisure travel.� Since the success of our business is directly linked to the

performance of the travel and lodging industries, the substantial layoffs in

these industries, the postponement of future hotel renovations and projects,

the substantial drop-off in guest occupancy and the dramatic reduction in

business and leisure travel, including convention traffic, have hurt our

ability to finalize contracts with hotel properties with which we have been

meeting and negotiating.� In this

regard, there is no assurance that we will be able to close contracts with our

current potential customers or that we will be successful in starting

discussions with other hotel properties.
�
QUALITATIVE

AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
�
Our products require a

limited amount of assembly at our facility in the United States.� We purchase refrigerators from suppliers in

the United States, Canada and China on a purchase order basis in U.S. Dollars.� All other components for our products are purchased

from suppliers based in the United States.�

Our products are primarily marketed in the United States, but we

eventually intend to further expand our marketing to the international lodging

market and to other industries domestically and internationally.� As a result, our financial results could be

affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets.� Because all of our revenues will be

denominated in U.S. Dollars, a strengthening of the dollar could make our

products less competitive in foreign markets.
�
As we expand operations

internationally, we will continue to evaluate our foreign currency exposures

and risks and develop appropriate hedging or other strategies to manage those

risks.� We have not revised our current

business practices to conform to Europe�s conversion to the Euro.

Issuance of Securities; Use of Proceeds.�� During the

three months ended March 31, 2002, we completed a private placement of our

common stock to certain accredited investors through which we issued 2,723,139

shares at a price of $0.52 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $1.4

million.� The private placement was

priced as of the closing price on the trading day prior to February�21,
2002.� The issuance of securities was

exempt from registration in reliance on Section�4(2) of the Securities Act

of 1933 and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder.� We did not engage any underwriters with respect to the private

placement of our common stock.� Although

we have not used the proceeds from this private placement, we propose to use

the proceeds from this private placement for general corporate purposes and

working capital.

Listing

Requirements.� Our common stock has been publicly traded

on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market since August 3, 2000.� Since June 22, 2001, our common stock has failed to meet the

minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 as required by the continued listing rules

of the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.� Under

the continued listing rules, a company whose securities fall below the minimum

bid price or the minimum public float requirements for 30 consecutive business

days is given a 90-day grace period to regain compliance.� A company may demonstrate compliance by

meeting the applicable standard for a minimum of 10 consecutive business

days.� If a company fails to regain

compliance within the applicable timeframe, that company is subject to

delisting.� On September 26, 2001, the

Nasdaq Board of Directors approved an across-the-board moratorium on the

minimum bid and public float requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq

effective as of such date and until January 2, 2002 and extended the grace

period to regain compliance from 90 days to 180 days.� As a result of the temporary relief provided by the new rules,

our common stock remained listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market despite failing

to meet the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing thereon in

effect prior to September 26, 2001.� On

February 14, 2002, we received notice from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market that the

closing bid price of our common stock price fell below $1.00 per share during

the previous 30 trading days.�

Subsequently, on April 10, 2002, we received notice from the Nasdaq

SmallCap Market that closing bid price of our common stock price reached $1.00

per share or greater for at least 10 consecutive business days and that, as a

result, we regained compliance with respect to the minimum bid price

requirement of the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.
