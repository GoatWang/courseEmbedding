			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks to achieve total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade, fixed-income securities with a weighted average effective maturity and effective duration of less than three years.

			
			
				
			
		


Monthly Income
An actively managed, short-term bond strategy for investors seeking monthly income, limited interest rate risk and total return opportunities.



Quality
 
Income
 
Potentially limited interest rate risk


Designed for risk-conscious investors, the investment grade bond portfolio is composed of short term, high quality government, corporate and structured securities.
 
The fund complements its core high quality bonds with measured exposure to high yield bonds, which may provide opportunities for higher risk adjusted returns and incremental yield.
 
The short term portfolio targets to keep the average effective maturity and effective duration, a measure of sensitivity to interest rate risk, less than three years, which may limit investor exposure to changing interest rates.1





Footnote(s)

1 The average effective maturity of a portfolio is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds, taking into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer. Effective duration is a measure, as estimated by the fund’s portfolio managers, of a bond fund's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It takes into account mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons and potential call dates. The longer a fund’s duration, the more sensitive the fund is to shifts in interest rates.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.

Ratings are based on S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. NR indicates the debtor was not rated, and should not be interpreted as indicating low quality. If securities are rated differently by the rating agencies, the higher rating is applied. Credit ratings are based largely on the rating agency's investment analysis at the time of rating and the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condition. The rating assigned to a security by a rating agency does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. For more information on the rating methodology, please visit the following NRSRO websites: www.standardandpoors.com and select 'Understanding Ratings' under Rating Resources on the homepage; www.moodys.com and select 'Rating Methodologies' under Research and Ratings on the homepage; www.fitchratings.com and select 'Ratings Definitions' on the homepage.

 About risk
			 


Active Trading Risk. Active trading of portfolio securities may result in
high brokerage costs, which may lower the Fund's actual return. Active
trading also may increase the proportion of the Fund's gains that are short
term, which are taxed at a higher rate than long term gains. 

Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current low interest
rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB)
and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates at or near zero. Increases in the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and
reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with
longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer
market-making capacity may persist in the future, potentially leading to
heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a
result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. In
addition, because of changing central bank policies, the Fund may
experience higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could
potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs and
potentially lower the Fund's performance returns. 

Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of
substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will
be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also
lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate
tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO
securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in
CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds
subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults
before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and
credit risk. 

Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will
be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer
and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes
the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on
longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling
interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities
that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest
rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest
payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline.
The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or
borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to
repay principal in a timely manner. If an issuer seeks to restructure the
terms of its borrowings or the Fund is required to seek recovery upon a
default in the payment of interest or the repayment of principal, the Fund
may incur additional expenses. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the
market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or
the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit
analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a
debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in
advance of a price decline or other credit event. 

Derivatives Risk. A derivative is an instrument whose value depends
largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, which are
described below.

Counterparty Risk. Certain derivatives do not trade on an established
    exchange (referred to as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives) and are
    simply financial contracts between the Fund and a counterparty.
    When the Fund is owed money on an OTC derivative, the Fund is
    dependent on the counterparty to pay or, in some cases, deliver the
    underlying asset, unless the Fund can otherwise sell its derivative
    contract to a third party prior to its expiration. Many counterparties
    are financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers and their
    creditworthiness (and ability to pay or perform) may be negatively
    impacted by factors affecting financial institutions generally. In
    addition, in the event that a counterparty becomes bankrupt or
    insolvent, the Fund's ability to recover the collateral that the Fund has
    on deposit with the counterparty could be delayed or impaired. For
    derivatives traded on a centralized exchange, the Fund generally is
    dependent upon the solvency of the relevant exchange clearing house
    (which acts as a guarantor for each contractual obligation under such
    derivatives) for payment on derivative instruments for which the Fund
    is owed money.
Leverage Risk. Many derivatives do not require a payment up front
    equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative,
    which creates a form of leverage. As a result, an adverse change in
    the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a
    loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the
    derivative. Leverage may therefore make the Fund's returns more
    volatile and increase the risk of loss. The Fund segregates or
    earmarks liquid assets with a value at least equal to the amount that
    the Fund owes the derivative counterparty each day, if any, or
    otherwise holds instruments that offset the Fund's daily obligation
    under the derivatives instrument. This process is sometimes referred
    to as "cover." The amount of liquid assets needed as cover will
    fluctuate over time as the value of the derivative instrument rises and
    falls. If the value of the Fund's derivative positions or the value of the
    assets used as cover unexpectedly decreases, the Fund may be
    forced to segregate additional liquid assets as cover or sell assets at
    a disadvantageous time or price to meet its derivative obligations or
    to meet redemption requests, which could affect management of the
    Fund and the Fund's returns. In certain market conditions, losses on
    derivative instruments can grow larger while the value of the Fund's
    other assets fall, resulting in the Fund's derivative positions becoming
    a larger percentage of the Fund's investments.
Liquidity Risk. There is a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for certain
    derivatives, particularly OTC derivatives, than more traditional
    investments such as stocks. These buyers and sellers are often
    financial institutions that may be unable or unwilling to buy or sell
    derivatives during times of financial or market stress. Derivative
    instruments may therefore be less liquid than more traditional
    investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or exit its derivative
    positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute
    under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be
    most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. To the extent that
    the Fund is unable to exit a derivative position because of market
    illiquidity, the Fund may not be able to prevent further losses of value
    in its derivatives holdings and the liquidity of the Fund and its ability
    to meet redemption requests may be impaired to the extent that a
    substantial portion of the Fund's otherwise liquid assets must be used
    as margin or cover. Another consequence of illiquidity is that the Fund
    may be required to hold a derivative instrument to maturity and take
    or make delivery of the underlying asset that the Adviser would
    otherwise have attempted to avoid.
Other Risks. Compared to other types of investments, derivatives may
    be harder to value and may also be less tax efficient, as described
    under the "Taxes" section of the prospectus. In addition, changes in
    government regulation of derivative instruments could affect the
    character, timing and amount of the Fund's taxable income or gains,
    and may limit or prevent the Fund from using certain types of
    derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy, which
    could make the investment strategy more costly to implement or
    require the Fund to change its investment strategy. To the extent that
    the Fund uses derivatives for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a
    particular market or market segment, there may be imperfect
    correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the
    value of the instrument being hedged or the relevant market or
    market segment, in which case the Fund may not realize the intended
    benefits. There is also the risk that during adverse market conditions,
    an instrument which would usually operate as a hedge provides no
    hedging benefits at all. The Fund's use of derivatives may be limited
    by the requirements for taxation of the Fund as a regulated
    investment company.

Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertainty regarding the existence
of trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment
than more developed markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging
markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price
fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law in
many emerging market countries is relatively new and unsettled. Therefore,
laws regarding foreign investment in emerging market securities, securities
regulation, title to securities, and shareholder rights may change quickly and
unpredictably. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal,
regional and local levels in emerging market countries may be inconsistent,
and subject to sudden change. Other risks of investing in emerging markets
securities may include additional transaction costs, delays in settlement
procedures, and lack of timely information. 

Foreign Credit Exposure Risk. U.S. dollar-denominated securities
carrying foreign credit exposure may be affected by unfavorable political,
economic or governmental developments that could affect payments of
principal and interest. 

Foreign Government Debt Risk. Investments in foreign government debt
securities (sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities) involve
certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt
securities generally. The issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities
that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay
principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt,
and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the
defaulting government. A foreign government debtor's willingness or ability
to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by,
among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its foreign
currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative
size of the debt burden, the foreign government debtor's policy toward its
principal international lenders and local political constraints. Certain issuers
of foreign government debt may be dependent on disbursements from
foreign governments, multinational agencies and other entities to reduce
principal and interest arrearages on their debt. Without the approval of debt
holders, some governmental debtors have in the past been able to
reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on
payments. 

Foreign Securities Risk. The value of the Fund's foreign investments
may be adversely affected by political and social instability in the home
countries of the issuers of the investments, by changes in economic or
taxation policies in those countries, or by the difficulty in enforcing
obligations in those countries. Foreign investments also involve the risk of
the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign
deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain
market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such
as exchange controls. Foreign companies generally may be subject to less
stringent regulations than U.S. companies, including financial reporting
requirements and auditing and accounting controls, and may therefore be
more susceptible to fraud or corruption. Also, there may be less publicly
available information about companies in certain foreign countries than
about U.S. companies making it more difficult for the Adviser to evaluate
those companies. The laws of certain countries may put limits on the Fund's
ability to recover its assets held at a foreign bank if the foreign bank,
depository or issuer of a security, or any of their agents, goes bankrupt.
Trading in many foreign securities may be less liquid and more volatile than
U.S. securities due to the size of the market or other factors. Unless the
Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also
involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may
cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other
instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to
decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over
short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always
successful. 

High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. The Fund's investments in
high yield debt securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") and other
lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These
securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's
ability to pay interest and principal when due and are more susceptible to
default or decline in market value due to adverse economic, regulatory,
political or company developments than higher rated or investment grade
securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile. These
securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities and may be
difficult to sell at a desirable time or price, particularly in times of negative
sentiment toward high yield securities. 

Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the
time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in
such investments. An investment may be illiquid due to a lack of trading
volume in the investment or if the investment is privately placed and not
traded in any public market or is otherwise restricted from trading. Certain
restricted securities require special registration and pose valuation
difficulties. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market
stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the
Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to
sell securities at significantly reduced prices. 

Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. There can be no guarantee
that the Adviser's investment techniques or investment decisions will
produce the desired results. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax
developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available
to the investment manager in connection with managing the Fund, which
may also adversely affect the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective. 

Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. The value of
the Fund's investments may go up or down due to general market
conditions which are not specifically related to the particular issuer, such as
real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general
outlook for revenues or corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency
rates, regional or global instability, or adverse investor sentiment generally.
The value of the Fund's investments may also go up or down due to factors
that affect an individual issuer or a particular industry or sector, such as
changes in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry.
Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those
of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general
downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in
value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific
investments held by the Fund will rise in value. 

Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities, including collateralized debt obligations and
collateralized mortgage obligations, differ from conventional debt securities
because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at
maturity. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment
or call risk, which is the risk that a borrower's payments may be received
earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on
underlying loans. Faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are
falling. As a result, the Fund may reinvest these early payments at lower
interest rates, thereby reducing the Fund's income. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities also are subject to extension risk. An unexpected
rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments and extend the
life of the mortgage- and asset-backed securities, causing the price of the
mortgage- and asset-backed securities and the Fund's share price to fall
and would make the mortgage- and asset-backed securities more sensitive
to interest rate changes. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the
mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of
mortgage-backed securities and will result in losses to the Fund. The Fund
may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages, which are
loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower
capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages. Privately issued
mortgage-related securities are not subject to the same underwriting
requirements for the underlying mortgages that are applicable to those
mortgage-related securities that have government or
government-sponsored entity guarantees. As a result, the mortgage loans
underlying privately issued mortgage-related securities may, and frequently
do, have less favorable collateral, credit risk or other underwriting
characteristics than government or government-sponsored
mortgage-related securities and have wider variances in a number of terms
including interest rate, term, size, purpose and borrower characteristics. 

Municipal Securities Risk. The risk of a municipal obligation generally
depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer. Constitutional
amendments, legislative enactments, executive orders, administrative
regulations, voter initiatives, and the issuer's regional economic conditions
may affect the municipal security's value, interest payments, repayment of
principal and the Fund's ability to sell the security. Municipal obligations may
be more susceptible to downgrades or defaults during recessions or similar
periods of economic stress. Municipal securities structured as revenue
bonds are generally not backed by the taxing power of the issuing
municipality but rather the revenue from the particular project or entity for
which the bonds were issued. If the Internal Revenue Service determines
that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax
requirements, interest from the security could be treated as taxable, which
could result in a decline in the security's value. In addition, there could be
changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate
the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or
otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of
municipal securities. 

TBA Transactions Risk. TBA transactions involve the risk that the
securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the
Fund when entering into the TBA transaction. TBA transactions also involve
the risk that the counterparty will fail to deliver the securities, exposing the
Fund to further losses. Whether or not the Fund takes delivery of the
securities at the termination date of a TBA transaction, the Fund will
nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying
investments during the term of the agreement. If the Fund sells short TBA
mortgages that it does not own and the mortgages increase in value, the
Fund may be required to pay a higher price than anticipated to purchase the
deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale and thereby incur a loss. A
short position in TBA mortgages poses more risk than holding the same TBA
mortgages long. It is possible that the market value of the mortgage
securities the Fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that
the market value of the mortgage securities the Fund has sold short
increases, thereby magnifying any losses. The more the Fund pays to
purchase the mortgage securities sold short, the more it will lose on the
transaction, which adversely affects its share price. The loss on a long
position is limited to what the Fund originally paid for the TBA mortgage,
together with any transaction costs. In short transactions, there is no limit on
how much the price of a security can increase, thus the Fund's exposure is
theoretically unlimited. The Fund normally closes a short sale of TBA
mortgages that it does not own by purchasing mortgage securities on the
open market and delivering them to the broker. The Fund may not always be
able to complete or "close out" the short position by purchasing mortgage
securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund incurs a
loss if the Fund is required to buy the deliverable mortgage securities at a
time when they have appreciated in value from the date of the short sale.
The Fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling TBA
mortgages short. In addition, taking short positions results in a form of
leverage. As a result, changes in the value of a Fund's investments will have
a larger effect on its share price than if it did not engage in these
transactions. 

U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations of U.S. Government
agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which could
affect the Fund's ability to recover should they default. No assurance can be
given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies
and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.
When-Issued, Delayed Delivery and Forward Commitment Risks.
When-issued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as
the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the
purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery
occurs. In addition, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies
on the buyer or seller, as the case may be, to consummate the transaction,
and failure by the counterparty to complete the transaction may result in the
Fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be
advantageous. These transactions have a leveraging effect on the Fund
because the Fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to
pay for until a later date. These investments therefore increase the Fund's
overall investment exposure and, as a result, its volatility. Typically, no
income accrues on securities the Fund has committed to purchase prior to
the time delivery of the securities is made, although the Fund may earn
income on securities it has set aside to cover these positions. 

Zero Coupon or Pay-In-Kind Securities Risk. Zero coupon and
pay-in-kind securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and less
liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated
securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods. Prices
on non-cash-paying instruments may be more sensitive to changes in the
issuer's financial condition, fluctuation in interest rates and market
demand/supply imbalances than cash-paying securities with similar credit
ratings, and thus may be more speculative. Investors may purchase zero
coupon and pay-in-kind securities at a price below the amount payable at
maturity. Because such securities do not entitle the holder to any periodic
payments of interest prior to maturity, this prevents any reinvestment of
interest payments at prevailing interest rates if prevailing interest rates rise.
The higher yields and interest rates on pay-in-kind securities reflect the
payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments
and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon
loans. Pay-in-kind securities may have a potential variability in valuations
because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the
collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated
collateral. Special tax considerations are associated with investing in certain
lower-grade securities, such as zero coupon or pay-in-kind securities.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
