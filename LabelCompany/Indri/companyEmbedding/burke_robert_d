Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Geck, Robert D H, MD2 Tampa General CirTampa, FL 33606(813) 259-8705Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Rehnke Robert D., MD6606 10th Ave NSaint Petersburg, FL 33710(727) 341-0337Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Meya, Robert D, MD10000 Bay Pines BlvdBay Pines, FL 33744(727) 398-6661Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Bazley, Robert D, MD3241 Lakeland Hills BlvdLakeland, FL 33805(863) 413-2620Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Potorski, Robert D1159 Nikki View DrBrandon, FL 33511(813) 661-6199Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Robert M Berland Ph.D. PA1402 Clarion DrValrico, FL 33596(813) 651-3551PsychologistsMedical ClinicsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Robert D Gruber DO2250 Drew StClearwater, FL 33765(727) 797-7463Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Robert S Klein Ph.D.901 N Hercules AveClearwater, FL 33765(727) 441-4579PsychologistsMedical ClinicsBusinesses in related categories to Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Tampa Allergy Center - Jack Parrino MD(1)5128 N Habana AveTampa, FL 33614(813) 906-0160Hospital & Nursing Home ConsultantsWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoDoctor Parrino is very excellent doctor.I went to dotor Parrina today.
