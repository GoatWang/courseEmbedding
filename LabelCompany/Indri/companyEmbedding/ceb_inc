Overview
Most leaders today believe that they have to invest in major projects or Transformation initiatives to realize meaningful growth. But what if you could grow without upending the business? What if you could unlock pockets of opportunity and productivity that would allow you to exceed expectations and give your employees the new skills and experiences they crave?
That’s where we come in.
CEB, now part of Gartner, helps customers grow by harnessing their untapped potential and channeling it toward high-impact, proven results.
We do this by offering advisory services and technology solutions that equip leaders to:

Turn the right insights into actions that deliver the right outcomes;
Upgrade processes and adapt culture to succeed in the new work environment; and
Apply precision to talent decisions for competitive advantage.

With more than 30 years of experience working in partnership with top companies, we have a unique view into what matters—and what works—when it comes to driving corporate performance. We invite you to explore new ways to grow with us.

Corporate Citizenship

CEB Corporate Citizenship, the philanthropic arm of CEB, seeks to provide the social sector with the same unparalleled intelligence and resources that CEB provides corporate-sector clients. At CEB, we believe that the most pressing problems facing leaders and their organizations have often been addressed—and solved—by other organizations. This is true in both the corporate and social sectors. At CEB, we focus our philanthropic efforts on driving nonprofit performance.  We have a unique view into what matters—and what works – and we apply proven practices to deliver innovative solutions that unlock the full potential of the social sector.

Supplier Diversity
In line with CEB’s continuous efforts to engage the local community through philanthropy and business relations, and CEB’s commitment to achieving minority spend goals provided by federal and local agencies, CEB is actively enhancing our Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Program.
To encourage inclusion, CEB is actively including small and socioeconomically diverse suppliers in sourcing activities where possible. Our sourcing efforts are aimed at providing opportunities for diverse suppliers (companies owned and operated in a HUBZONE, certified as 8(a), and/or owned and operated by minorities, women, or veterans). It is CEB’s goal to continue to grow its Supplier Diversity Program to “Best in Class” levels.
CEB’s primary purchases include; Professional Services, Staff Augmentation Services, Technology; including Software and Hardware, and Specialized/Niche Services specific to our industry, in addition to traditional procurements related to running a global services related footprint.
If you are qualified as one of the following small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov), and would like to be considered as a potential Supplier, please contact us:

Small Businesses, as defined by your industry NAICS Code
HUBZone
Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB)
8(a) – qualified by the SBA
Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB)
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)
Women Owned Small Business (WOSB)
Native American, Hawaiian, and Alaskan Native
Historically Black Colleges, Universities or Minority Institutes and Organizations

CEB will reach out to your organization once we have qualified your business and, when and if there are opportunities that match your firm’s capabilities. To assist with reviewing your capabilities, please include any relevant supporting documentation and a means to contact you. This statement does not guarantee business awards, nor does it obligate CEB to purchase anything from your Firm.
 
If you are interested in working with CEB, please contact our Small Business Liaison – George Santoro – gsantoro@cebglobal.com or via mail – Attention George Santoro, CEB Global Procurement, 1919 North Lynn Street, Arlington, VA 22209, USA.

CEB INC. Company Profile

   Don't fear the competition; learn from it. So says CEB, a provider of business research and analysis services to more than 10,000 companies worldwide. Its program areas cover "best practices" in such topics as finance, human resources, information technology, operations, and sales and marketing. Unlike consulting firms, which engage with one client at a time, CEB operates on a membership-based business model. Members subscribe to one or more of the company's programs and participate in the research and analysis, thus sharing expertise with others. Besides reports on best practices, CEB offers seminars, customized research briefs, and decision-support tools.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls. By using the information provided on the Hoover’s sites, as the direct marketer you represent and warrant that you will use such information in compliance with all applicable local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including any local do not call registers or marketing regulations, and agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dun & Bradstreet and each of its affiliates in the event your use violates such laws and regulations.
