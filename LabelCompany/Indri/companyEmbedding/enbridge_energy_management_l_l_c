Bridges

Bridges integrate our platform with all of your smart devices, sensors, and equipment. We support a wide range of protocols to simplify your HVAC controls, utility metering, environmental monitoring, and more. Contact us with questions about what to connect with Senseware.
 










Nodes

Nodes connect with the bridges via our patent pending Universal Sensor Interface to collect data and to transmit the collected data wirelessly to the gateway. Nodes can be quickly and easily deployed because the wireless communication is optimized for extensive reach with minimal power consumption. Each node can be equipped with an internal battery, which can be used as a primary power source or as a backup power source in the event a power outage occurs. Nodes also include memory storage for retention of collected data.










Gateways

Gateways send your data to the cloud in real-time and can connect to the Internet via Ethernet or cellular. One gateway can handle an unlimited number of data streams from any site. Similar to the nodes, each gateway is equipped with an internal battery as a backup power source and memory storage to ensure that you’re never missing data.















Cloud Data Solutions
Within minutes of installation you can begin streaming real-time data. You’ll have the flexibility to subscribe to part of all of your data at any given time. In addition, individual users may subscribe to varying data streams from the same site, allowing each user to receive only the data they need. With Senseware data you can:




Subscribe to Your Data StreamTo subscribe to your data simply type your destination URL and specify which feeds and at what frequency you’d like to receive the data. No special programming is required and you can create multiple data stream subscriptions from a single site. The data is received over HTTP of HTTPS post packets in JSON format. Check Your System's StatusKeep a pulse on the health of your Senseware infrastructure. You'll be notified immediately via text or email if the system needs attention. This allows both you and our support team to troubleshoot remotely or determine if an on-site inspection is necessary.Remotely Configure Your SystemSend commands back to your installed Senseware infrastructure remotely to make necessary changes such as the frequency of data to be collected, specific sensor configurations, or switching sensors on and off.

Our Story

             if (get_field('our_story_text')): ?>
            
Upon completing his PhD work assessing the severity of Parkinson’s disease in patients using accelerometers, CTO Julien Stamatakis realized the need for a standardized universal sensor platform. This platform would be simple to use and make data available from any sensor, regardless of the type of data being collected.
After discussing the idea with CEO Serene Almomen, they founded Senseware in 2013, and today, we continue to build off the original concept offering a platform that enables facility managers, building owners, analytics software providers, and consultants to better understand and make use of data from the world around us.
We’re developing new capabilities and improvements to our platform every day, addressing key challenges faced by our customers and partners, while investing in new people to grow our team and cultivate the traditions and culture Senseware will carry forward.
