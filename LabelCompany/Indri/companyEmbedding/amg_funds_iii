Click a fund name to view that fund's detailed performance information.
The performance shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. From time to time the advisor has waived fees or reimbursed expenses, which may have resulted in higher returns. The listed returns and yields on the Fund are net of expenses. Performance shown does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, or redemption fees, which would have reduced the performance.
Morningstar rating as of June 30, 2017. 
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the share class indicated only (see ticker); other share classes may have different performance characteristics. The Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Rankings may have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The performance shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. From time to time, the advisor has waived fees or reimbursed expenses, which may have resulted in higher returns. The listed returns and yields of the Fund are net of expenses, and the returns and yields of the indices exclude expenses.Unlike the Fund, the Index listed is unmanaged, is not available for investment and does not incur expenses. 








Fund Update
Effective February 27, 2017, the share classes offered and/or fees paid by certain of our Funds are being restructured to better align with the needs of our investors. These changes may affect the amount of fees you will pay as an investor.  Please review the Fund's prospectus for details.

*Prior to October 1, 2016, the Fund was known as AMG Managers Bond Fund.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 
Morningstar Rating is for the share class indicated only (see ticker); other share classes may have different performance characteristics. The Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Rankings may have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
