In addition to serving as COO, prior to this role, Karaoglan was also CEO, Retirement and Investment Solutions, with oversight of the company’s Retirement, Annuities and Investment Management businesses. He has been a key driver of Voya’s transformation and value creation leading up to and following its initial public offering in May 2013.

He joined AIG at a critical time during its global restructuring. Spearheading the Divestiture team, he managed over 40 transactions, including the IPO of AIA, a pan-Asian life insurance company, and the sale of Alico (American Life Insurance Company) to MetLife.
Prior to AIG, Karaoglan was managing director, Equity Research, for Banc of America Securities LLC.

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
