Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLVS) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research report issued to clients and investors on Wednesday. The firm currently has a $105.00 price objective on the biopharmaceutical company’s stock. Zacks Investment Research‘s price target points to a potential upside of 11.58% from the company’s previous close. 
According to Zacks, “Clovis got a huge boost with the FDA granting accelerated approval to its advanced ovarian cancer treatment, Rubraca in Dec 2016. Rubraca has bright prospects, given the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Successful commercialization will significantly boost Clovis’ sales. Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable indication. Several studies on Rubraca, targeting different types of ovarian cancer patients, are currently underway. Promising progression-free survival and safety results from the ARIEL3 maintenance study will help expand Rubraca’s label, thereby improving the commercial uptake of the drug. Clovis’ heavy dependence on Rubraca, the only approved product, for growth is concerning. Rubraca is set to face intense competition from currently marketed PARP inhibitors. Loss estimates have widened lately ahead of the Q2 results. Clovis has a mixed earnings surprise record in the recent quarters.”
CLVS has been the subject of a number of other research reports. Piper Jaffray Companies  set a $77.00 target price on shares of Clovis Oncology and gave the stock a “buy” rating in a report on Tuesday, March 14th.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
