Kraig Biocraft Laboratories to Open New Vietnam Headquarters in Quang Nam Province



ANN ARBOR, Mich., – July 24 – Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, announced today that it has identified and selected the location for its operational headquarters in Vietnam.  Located in the heart of Quang Nam province, this area provides a vast supply of skilled workers, close proximity to mulberry fields, and easy access to international air and sea ports.  This location was selected based on a series of productive and successful meetings between representatives of Kraig Labs, provincial leaders, and local silk experts.  The Company plans for this facility to be used for the first shipment of the Company’s transgenic silkworm technology into Vietnam. 
“Identifying our corporate headquarters was an essential part of our application to import our silkworm into Vietnam,” Said COO Jon Rice.  “With this location finalized we are now preparing the final importation documents for submission in order to obtain approvals to begin work with our hybrid silk technology in Vietnam.”
In addition to progress made in securing a new Vietnamese headquarters the Company has also been working with local experts to prepare a master plan for the 50 hectares dedicated to this project.  The Company expects to review those plans in the coming weeks.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Delivers First Dragon Silk Fiber Samples to US Army



ANN ARBOR, Mich., -May 19, 2017- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, today announced that it has delivered the first samples of Dragon Silk to the US Army for independent testing.  The Company provided several samples of individual silk filaments as well as finished Dragon Silk thread for evaluation.
“We are pleased to report that we have delivered the first samples of Dragon Silk to our US Army sponsor for independent performance confirmation,” said the Company’s COO Jon Rice.  “These samples mark the starting point for what we hope will be a long lasting and profound impact on protective equipment for those dedicated to protecting us.  The speed that our Indiana facility was able to ramp up to meet this request helps to confirm, that we have the ability to promptly deliver a top quality, cost effective, fiber to the Army and future commercial customers.”
The Company is producing Dragon Silk at its Indiana factory and expects to make final delivery of the shoot packs for ballistic testing later this year.

Kraig Labs Releases Q1 2017 Edition of Spider Sense



Kraig Labs releases Q1 2017 edition of Spider Sense






Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Expands Domestic Spider Silk Production Capacity



Kraig Labs Installing New Silk Processing Equipment to Speed up Delivery Times for Spider Silk
ANN ARBOR, Mich., – April 17, 2017 – Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, announced today that it is expanding domestic recombinant spider silk production capacity with the purchase and installation of a new commercial scale cocoon processing machine.  This new equipment arrived in early April, is being installed now, and is expected to be fully operational before the end of the month. 
This machine replaces a much smaller cocoon processing machine the Company has been using to produce materials under a contract with the US Army.  The increased capacity and efficiency this new equipment offers will free up production staff and lower overall costs. 
Over the next month the Company plans to supply the Army with sample single filament Dragon Silk fibers for independent testing and to have the first batch of finished Dragon Silk thread ready for knitting into Ballistic shootpacks.  The Company anticipates completing the additional silk necessary for producing the woven shootpacks for the US Army in the third quarter.  This newly installed equipment is expected to play an important role in meeting this new timeline. 
“In many cases, up until now, we’ve been working with research scale equipment as we transitioned out of the laboratory,” said COO Jon Rice.  “We had originally hoped to have completed all silk production for the first Army contact by now.  That timeline, in consultation with our customer, has been extended due to challenges that a third party vendor had in scheduling and processing as well as the throughput limitations of our production facility in its first month of operations.  This new equipment can process more cocoons in one hour than we currently process in a month and it is expected to play an important role in meeting the new timeline.  This new commercial scale machine is expected to sustain our domestic production capacity through 2019 and reduce labor costs significantly.”
In addition to its planned expansion of domestic production, the Company, as earlier announced, is working to establish a significant overseas production operation.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Awarded Investment Certificate in Vietnam



The issuance of the Investment Certificate is a major step toward high tech silk production in Vietnam

ANN ARBOR, Mich., – March 27, 2017 – Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, announced today that it has just been awarded an Investment Certificate for the production of high technology silk in Vietnam’s Quang Nam province.
The Investment Certificate was issued to the Company during the March 26, 2017 Quang Nam Investment Conference, which was attended by Vietnam’s Prime Minister and numerous high level central government officials, including the ministers of all relevant governmental departments, as well as high level officials from Quang Nam province, including the Chairman and key provincial officials. Representing Kraig Labs at the meeting were the Company’s CEO and Founder, Kim Thompson, and COO, Jon Rice.
“It was an honor to receive this award on stage from the Chairman in front of the Prime Minister,” said Thompson. “This is a huge step forward in our plans to expand production on a large scale. We look forward to the opportunity to revitalize silk production, using high technology, in an area of the world with a strong history of quality silks and textiles.”
This Investment Certificate award was the necessary and final step before the Company seeks central government approval for the expansion of Kraig Labs’ business. The Company’s efforts to secure that final approval are well underway.
“I would like to personally thank the Chairman and his staff for working so closely with us to finalize the Investment Certificate,” stated Rice. “While this is a momentous occasion for Kraig Biocraft Laboratories and our shareholders, it is also a turning point in the commercialization of advanced fibers.”
 
The Investment Conference is receiving significant media coverage in Vietnam, including several English language media outlets.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories’ Management Completes Site Survey with Vietnamese Officials



ANN ARBOR, Mich., – March 17, 2017 – Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, announced today that the Company’s management just completed a site survey trip in Quang Nam province, Vietnam, with Vietnamese officials. 
Company leadership worked with local officials to identify potential locations for the Company’s silk production operations.  Properties identified include a Greenfield site and existing facilities that should meet both short term and long term requirements for space and production.  The Company is now working with Vietnamese officials to pursue approvals for investment and for the introduction of our hybrid silkworm.
“After touring the province and reviewing numerous potential sites, I believe we’ve found excellent locations to begin production in Vietnam,” said COO Jon Rice.  “We are still working to secure necessary approvals and no final decisions have been made. However, the region’s existing infrastructure and expertise are cause to believe that we should be able to follow the same operation ramp up as our Indiana facility.  We would like to, again, thank our Vietnamese host for their hospitality and look forward to future meetings and discussions.”

ANN ARBOR, Mich., -March 3, 2017- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, today announced it has completed the planting of the first 2,000 mulberry trees at its Texas location.  This facility and these trees will be used to supply the Company’s US recombinant spider silk operations with fresh mulberry leaves.  The Company expects to begin harvesting these leaves in the 3rd or 4th quarter of this year. 
“We’ve invested a tremendous amount of effort over the last thirty days preparing the new Texas facility and planting these first 2,000 trees,” said COO Jon Rice.  “Those long days and a handful of fire ant bites have rewarded us, with what we expect, will be the capacity to support all of our US silk production without the need of expensive artificial diet.  We’re looking forward to our first harvest this fall.”
The Company is now in the process of assessing its needs for additional mulberry trees and will make a decision regarding additional plantings later this year.

Spider Silk


Introduction to Spider Silk, the Product

It has long been known that certain fibers produced in nature possess remarkable mechanical properties in terms of strength, resilience and flexibility. These protein based fibers, exemplified by spider silk, have been the subject of much interest due to spider silk’s incredible toughness. Because of its strength, resilience and flexibility, spider silk holds great promise for commercial and consumer applications. While the superior properties of spider silks are well known, there was no known way to produce spider silk in commercial quantities. Since spiders are cannibalistic, they cannot be raised in concentrated colonies to produce silk.
The production of spider silk in commercial quantities holds the potential of a life-saving ballistic resistant material, which is lighter, thinner, more flexible, and tougher than steel. Other applications of spider silk include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories’ believes that in the near future, genetically engineered spider silk will make significant inroads into the market for high-strength fibers.
Spider Silk Technology

While scientists have been able to replicate the proteins that are the building blocks of spider silk, two technological barriers have (until now) stymied production. These barriers are the inability to form these proteins into a spider silk fiber with the desired mechanical characteristics, and to do this cost effectively.
To solve these problems, Kraig invented a new technology and acquired the exclusive right to use the patented genetic sequences for numerous fundamental spider silk proteins. We have placed ourselves in an advanced position by working collaboratively with the leading universities which developed some of the most relevant genetic engineering technologies. In fact, most of our genetic engineering work takes place inside university laboratories.
Kraig is the world leader in genetically engineered spider silk technologies. We earned that place by applying our proprietary genetic engineering spider silk technology to an organism which is already one of the most efficient commercial producers of silk: The domesticated silkworm.
Kraig’s spider silk technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm for this application. The silkworm is ideally suited to produce genetically engineered spider silk because it is already an efficient commercial and industrial producer of silk. Forty percent (40%) of the caterpillars’ weight is devoted to the silk glands. The silk glands produce large volumes of protein, called fibroin, which are then spun into a composite protein thread (silk). [1]
We have used genetic engineering technology to create spider silk. A part of Kraig’s intellectual property portfolio is the exclusive right to use the patented spider silk gene sequences in silkworm.[2]
Spider Silk Strength: Stronger Than Steel
Kraig envisions genetically engineered spider silk, with its superior mechanical characteristics, will surpass the current generation of high-performance fiber. We believe that spider silk is in some ways so superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace, that an expansion of demand and market opportunities will follow spider silk’s commercial introduction. For example, the ability of natural spider silk to absorb in excess of 100,000 joules of kinetic energy makes it a potentially ideal material for structural blast protection. The table below illustrates spider silk’s incredible toughness and strength to weight ratios.

The Market for Spider Silk
Kraig is focused on the creation, production and marketing of high performance and technical fibers such as spider silk. Because spider silks are stronger and tougher than steel, they could be used in a wide variety of military, industrial, and consumer applications ranging from ballistic protection to superior strength and toughness.
The global market demand for technical fibers is growing rapidly and these materials have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications. By 2012, the annual global market for technical fibers had already reached approximately $133 billion.
We believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of spider silk will open up new applications for the technology and result in a significant increase in demand. The materials which we are working to produce are stronger than steel. Spider silks can justifiably be referred to as “super fibers.”
Genetically Engineered Spider Silk and Synthetic Spider Silk

Kraig has created approximately twenty different genetically engineered spider silk fibers based on our genetic designs. A scientific article fully describing one of the first of these remarkable spider silk fibers and our methodology for creating it has been peer reviewed and published in the prestigious science journal PNAS (the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences). We use the term genetically engineered spider silk instead of synthetic spider silk because these materials are not synthetic; they are made by genetically engineered silkworms and the fiber is composed entirely of protein produced naturally by the silkworm. They are synthetic spider silks only in the sense that they are not being produced by a spider, but by a much more efficient organism.
Kraig’s lead product is a genetically engineered spider silk known as Dragon Silk™. Its closely related sister product Monster Silk®. Both Dragon Silk™ and Monster Silk® are spun by lines of our transgenic silkworms. They are composed of a unique combination of spider silk protein and silkworm silk protein. These genetically engineered spider silks are significantly stronger and more flexible than commercial grade silk. We believe that this product will make significant inroads into both technical textile and mundane silk and apparel markets. The traditional silk market is estimated at approximately $3 to $5 billion (US) per year at the raw fiber level. Given its superior physical properties, Monster Silk™ particularly is well positioned to penetrate that market.
Dragon Silk™, represents a massive leap forward in the Company’s recombinant spider silk technology, combining both the elasticity and strength elements of native spider silk. We expect applications for form of spider silk, and its derivative products, to have uses in both the technical and protective textile markets.
Kraig is in the process of ramping up commercial production of its genetically engineered spider silks, including Monster Silk™ and Dragon Silk™.
Kraig is also in the advanced development stage for its next-generation spider silk product, tentatively known as SpiderPillar™. SpiderPillar™ will be an essentially pure spider silk. This material holds the potential to make significant inroads into the technical textiles market.
Our third line of products, which we refer to as “Gen 3 technical and medical fiber,” is designed to move beyond the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of natural spider silk. Gen 3 fibers are in a relatively early stage of development and will incorporate such elements as antibacterial agents for medical use, and metallic ions for use in industrial processes.
More About Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, the Leader in Genetically Engineered Spider Silk

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (KBLB) is a biotechnology company focused on the commercialization and development of spider silk. Kraig is a genetic engineering company working in concert with leading university laboratories. We are a fully reporting, publicly traded company whose shares are traded on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol: KBLB.
The inventor of this technology, Kim Thompson, is the founder and CEO of Kraig. Kraig’s ability to produce spider silk is cost effective, and capable of producing a wide range of proteins and fibers and materials. Teams of other scientist around the world have worked on other ways to produce spider silk including using genetically engineered E.coli bacteria. That work is scientifically sound, but with production costs that could exceed $37,500 per kilogram, it is difficult to see how these programs could capture a significant part of the textile market.[6] Kraig is able to produce its genetically engineered spider silks, including Monster Silk™, at less than 1% of that cost.
In 2013, Kraig successfully completed its pilot production program for its spider silk product, Monster Silk™. We are currently ramping up commercial scale production of Dragon Silk.
On July 12, 2016, we announced our first U.S. Military contract to deliver Dragon Silk™.  Kraig Labs will deliver spider silk-based ballistic shoot packs for performance testing for solider-related protective applications.  Shortly thereafter we announced that we had taken possession of a new production facility in Indiana for the purpose of scaling up production of Dragon Silk and other spider silk based products.
Kraig continues a collaborative research and development effort with The University of Notre Dame. This has resulted in a number of exciting spider silk technological breakthroughs. Those breakthroughs include the development of numerous strains of transgenic silkworm which produce genetically engineered spider silk. Some of our work is reviewed and described in the prestigious peer reviewed science journal PNAS (the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences).

Spider Silk  |  Research and Development  |  Compare Technologies
Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (Trading Symbol: KBLB) is applying its proprietary genetic engineering technology to find solutions in the areas of material science. We are developing  genetically engineered spider silk which we believe will have broad applications for the multibillion dollar textile industry and in the market place for high-strength materials.
Our investments in spider silk related genetic research are focused on product development and innovative near-term solutions to the practical problems of our world. These investments have resulted in our widely heralded success in developing recombinant spider silks and the first ever technology for commercial production of the same.
Life Science and Spider Silk Technology
Spider Silk is among the strongest fibers produced in nature. Some spider species are capable of producing up to seven different types of silk depending upon the spider’s particular need at that time. For example, a spider will use one type of silk to make the structural supports for its web, and another type to wrap its captured pray. Drag line silk, the silk used when a spider is rappelling, is of particular commercial interest. Spider silk, a natural polymer is both extremely strong and extremely flexible. These properties of the underlying polymer create the potential for exciting commercial opportunities.
Applications of Spider Silk and High-Performance Fibers
Spider silk holds the potential of a lifesaving ballistic resistant material; lighter, thinner, flexible and tougher than steel material. These mechanical properties are similar and yet exceed that of many of the high performance technical fibers that are currently on the market today.  High performance technical fibers are currently used in a wide variety of military, industrial, and consumer applications requiring superior strength, toughness and flexibility. On this point, in 2016 Kraig Labs signed a contract with the U.S. Army for the development and delivery of ballistic shoot packs.
The Challenge: Production of Genetically Engineered Spider Silk
Hailed as one of nature’s most remarkable materials, spider silk is made when spiders spin liquid protein into solid fibers. While the superior properties of spider silks were well known, there was no known way to produce the fibers in commercial quantity. The spiders are cannibalistic, and cannot be raised in concentrated colonies. Until now, this technological barrier has stymied spider silk production.
Our Solution: Production of Genetically Engineered Spider Silk
At its inception, Kraig Labs obtained proprietary genetic engineering technology to unlock the mystery of producing spider silk. It was in early 2006 that the company obtained certain exclusive rights from the University of Wyoming to utilize the spider silk gene sequences in our field of use. This web site previously stated that the company was working to reduce its technology to practice. That changed with the public announcement of our success on September 29, 2010. We are currently ramping up production of our Monster Silk™ and Dragon Silk™  for commercialization and continuing to develop new and exciting recombinant spider silk fibers.
Monster Silk™ is the world’s first economically viable recombinant spider silk for textile use: a thin, lightweight, flexible and high strength fiber.  Kraig is ramping up commercial scale production of Monster Silk™, the cleanest commercial alternative to the high strength technical textiles. We believe that this product will make significant inroads into both technical textile and mundane silk and apparel markets. The traditional silk market is estimated at approximately $3 to $5 billion (US) per year at the raw fiber level. Given its superior physical properties, Monster Silk™ is well positioned to penetrate that market, as well as the larger technical textile market which is estimated at approximately $130 billion (US).
In 2015, we announced a breakthrough: our Dragon Silk™ line of transgenic silkworms. It and its progeny have proven not only to be stronger and more elastic than commercial grade silkworm silk, but stronger and more elastic than certain spider dragline silks.
In 2016, we produced four new distinct transgenic lines, which use the most complex genetic designs in the company’s history. On top of the new lines, the lab also produced a new genetic insertion design for more effective gene splicing. This new design incorporated the properties of our Dragon Silk™ and Monster Silk™ into a single construction. This experiment to merge Monster Silk’s elasticity focus with the strength focus of Dragon Silk into a single package was the logical next step for the technology.
In 2016 Kraig Labs secured its first material development and delivery contract from the US Army. Under this contract, Kraig Labs will providing the Army with ballistic shoot packs and silk fibers for testing and evaluation.

Artificial spider silk


Website
www.kraiglabs.com


Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. was founded by Kim Thompson in April 2006 to develop and commercialize spider silks and other high performance polymers using spider silk gene sequences discovered and invented at the University of Wyoming by Dr. Randy Lewis, in combination with genetic engineering strategies developed by Dr. Malcolm Fraser (University of Notre Dame) and Donald Jarvis (University of Wyoming).[1]

The Science[edit]
The method used to genetically modify the silkworm uses the PiggyBac Transposon vector discovered and developed by Dr. Fraser at the University of Notre Dame. Specific sequences of spider silk DNA are inserted into the genetic makeup of the silkworm to create a strain of the insect that now produces the spider protein. They are able to customize the sequences that are inserted into the silkworm, thus giving the ability to customize the resulting silkworm's thread strength and flexibility. To ensure the silkworm has been genetically modified, a gene was attached that gave the transgenic silkworms red glowing eyes. The thread produced by the transgenic silkworms is close to the strength and flexibility of the native spider. Strength relative to native spider silk is 80%.[2] Kraig Biocraft Laboratories is not the first to create transgenic silkworms incorporating spider silk proteins. Where Kraig Labs has succeeded is that the spider silk proteins are integrated structurally into the transgenic silkworm fiber.[3]
Silkworms are not the only species to be altered in the attempt to create a new source of spider silk. Another firm, Nexia Biotech, created Transgenic goats. These goats produced spider silk proteins in their milk. The finished fiber, a product of wet spinning, was much thicker than native spider silk and proved not to be commercially viable due to cost.[4]
Artificial Spider Silk Applications[edit]
Kraig Labs has successfully created at least 20 transgenic silkworm variants so far, each expressing different levels of spider silk proteins. Silk with strength equaling native spider silk has applications such as: car airbags, bulletproof vests, seat belts, parachutes, nets, and sporting goods.[5] If the future transgenic silkworms are able to exceed the strength of native spider silk then medical applications could be using the recombinant silk. Potential uses in the medical industry are bandages that have the ability to reduce scarring versus using traditional bandages. The silk could also be used as a scaffolding material for artificial tendon and ligament repair.[6]

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. was founded by Kim Thompson in April 2006 to develop and commercialize spider silks and other high performance polymers using spider silk gene sequences discovered and invented at the University of Wyoming by Dr. Randy Lewis, in combination with genetic engineering strategies developed by Dr. Malcolm Fraser (University of Notre Dame) and Donald Jarvis (University of Wyoming).[1]

The Science[edit]
The method used to genetically modify the silkworm uses the PiggyBac Transposon vector discovered and developed by Dr. Fraser at the University of Notre Dame. Specific sequences of spider silk DNA are inserted into the genetic makeup of the silkworm to create a strain of the insect that now produces the spider protein. They are able to customize the sequences that are inserted into the silkworm, thus giving the ability to customize the resulting silkworm's thread strength and flexibility. To ensure the silkworm has been genetically modified, a gene was attached that gave the transgenic silkworms red glowing eyes. The thread produced by the transgenic silkworms is close to the strength and flexibility of the native spider. Strength relative to native spider silk is 80%.[2] Kraig Biocraft Laboratories is not the first to create transgenic silkworms incorporating spider silk proteins. Where Kraig Labs has succeeded is that the spider silk proteins are integrated structurally into the transgenic silkworm fiber.[3]
Silkworms are not the only species to be altered in the attempt to create a new source of spider silk. Another firm, Nexia Biotech, created Transgenic goats. These goats produced spider silk proteins in their milk. The finished fiber, a product of wet spinning, was much thicker than native spider silk and proved not to be commercially viable due to cost.[4]
Artificial Spider Silk Applications[edit]
Kraig Labs has successfully created at least 20 transgenic silkworm variants so far, each expressing different levels of spider silk proteins. Silk with strength equaling native spider silk has applications such as: car airbags, bulletproof vests, seat belts, parachutes, nets, and sporting goods.[5] If the future transgenic silkworms are able to exceed the strength of native spider silk then medical applications could be using the recombinant silk. Potential uses in the medical industry are bandages that have the ability to reduce scarring versus using traditional bandages. The silk could also be used as a scaffolding material for artificial tendon and ligament repair.[6]

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories to Open New Vietnam Headquarters in Quang Nam Province




















July 24, 2017 16:30 ET

 | Source: Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.






ANN ARBOR, Mich., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB:KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, announced today that it has identified and selected the location for its operational headquarters in Vietnam.  Located in the heart of Quang Nam province, this area provides a vast supply of skilled workers, close proximity to mulberry fields, and easy access to international air and sea ports.  This location was selected based on a series of productive and successful meetings between representatives of Kraig Labs, provincial leaders, and local silk experts.  The Company plans for this facility to be used for the first shipment of the Company’s transgenic silkworm technology into Vietnam.  “Identifying our corporate headquarters was an essential part of our application to import our silkworm into Vietnam,” said COO Jon Rice.  “With this location finalized we are now preparing the final importation documents for submission in order to obtain approvals to begin work with our hybrid silk technology in Vietnam.” In addition to progress made in securing a new Vietnamese headquarters the Company has also been working with local experts to prepare a master plan for the 50 hectares dedicated to this project.  The Company expects to review those plans in the coming weeks.

Spider Silk | Kraig Biocraft Laboratories



















































Technology 



















Spider Silk


Introduction to Spider Silk, the Product

It has long been known that certain fibers produced in nature possess remarkable mechanical properties in terms of strength, resilience and flexibility. These protein based fibers, exemplified by spider silk, have been the subject of much interest due to spider silk’s incredible toughness. Because of its strength, resilience and flexibility, spider silk holds great promise for commercial and consumer applications. While the superior properties of spider silks are well known, there was no known way to produce spider silk in commercial quantities. Since spiders are cannibalistic, they cannot be raised in concentrated colonies to produce silk.
The production of spider silk in commercial quantities holds the potential of a life-saving ballistic resistant material, which is lighter, thinner, more flexible, and tougher than steel. Other applications of spider silk include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories’ believes that in the near future, genetically engineered spider silk will make significant inroads into the market for high-strength fibers.
Spider Silk Technology

While scientists have been able to replicate the proteins that are the building blocks of spider silk, two technological barriers have (until now) stymied production. These barriers are the inability to form these proteins into a spider silk fiber with the desired mechanical characteristics, and to do this cost effectively.
To solve these problems, Kraig invented a new technology and acquired the exclusive right to use the patented genetic sequences for numerous fundamental spider silk proteins. We have placed ourselves in an advanced position by working collaboratively with the leading universities which developed some of the most relevant genetic engineering technologies. In fact, most of our genetic engineering work takes place inside university laboratories.
Kraig is the world leader in genetically engineered spider silk technologies. We earned that place by applying our proprietary genetic engineering spider silk technology to an organism which is already one of the most efficient commercial producers of silk: The domesticated silkworm.
Kraig’s spider silk technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm for this application. The silkworm is ideally suited to produce genetically engineered spider silk because it is already an efficient commercial and industrial producer of silk. Forty percent (40%) of the caterpillars’ weight is devoted to the silk glands. The silk glands produce large volumes of protein, called fibroin, which are then spun into a composite protein thread (silk). [1]
We have used genetic engineering technology to create spider silk. A part of Kraig’s intellectual property portfolio is the exclusive right to use the patented spider silk gene sequences in silkworm.[2]
Spider Silk Strength: Stronger Than Steel
Kraig envisions genetically engineered spider silk, with its superior mechanical characteristics, will surpass the current generation of high-performance fiber. We believe that spider silk is in some ways so superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace, that an expansion of demand and market opportunities will follow spider silk’s commercial introduction. For example, the ability of natural spider silk to absorb in excess of 100,000 joules of kinetic energy makes it a potentially ideal material for structural blast protection. The table below illustrates spider silk’s incredible toughness and strength to weight ratios.

The Market for Spider Silk
Kraig is focused on the creation, production and marketing of high performance and technical fibers such as spider silk. Because spider silks are stronger and tougher than steel, they could be used in a wide variety of military, industrial, and consumer applications ranging from ballistic protection to superior strength and toughness.
The global market demand for technical fibers is growing rapidly and these materials have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications. By 2012, the annual global market for technical fibers had already reached approximately $133 billion.
We believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of spider silk will open up new applications for the technology and result in a significant increase in demand. The materials which we are working to produce are stronger than steel. Spider silks can justifiably be referred to as “super fibers.”
Genetically Engineered Spider Silk and Synthetic Spider Silk

Kraig has created approximately twenty different genetically engineered spider silk fibers based on our genetic designs. A scientific article fully describing one of the first of these remarkable spider silk fibers and our methodology for creating it has been peer reviewed and published in the prestigious science journal PNAS (the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences). We use the term genetically engineered spider silk instead of synthetic spider silk because these materials are not synthetic; they are made by genetically engineered silkworms and the fiber is composed entirely of protein produced naturally by the silkworm. They are synthetic spider silks only in the sense that they are not being produced by a spider, but by a much more efficient organism.
Kraig’s lead product is a genetically engineered spider silk known as Dragon Silk™. Its closely related sister product Monster Silk®. Both Dragon Silk™ and Monster Silk® are spun by lines of our transgenic silkworms. They are composed of a unique combination of spider silk protein and silkworm silk protein. These genetically engineered spider silks are significantly stronger and more flexible than commercial grade silk. We believe that this product will make significant inroads into both technical textile and mundane silk and apparel markets. The traditional silk market is estimated at approximately $3 to $5 billion (US) per year at the raw fiber level. Given its superior physical properties, Monster Silk™ particularly is well positioned to penetrate that market.
Dragon Silk™, represents a massive leap forward in the Company’s recombinant spider silk technology, combining both the elasticity and strength elements of native spider silk. We expect applications for form of spider silk, and its derivative products, to have uses in both the technical and protective textile markets.
Kraig is in the process of ramping up commercial production of its genetically engineered spider silks, including Monster Silk™ and Dragon Silk™.
Kraig is also in the advanced development stage for its next-generation spider silk product, tentatively known as SpiderPillar™. SpiderPillar™ will be an essentially pure spider silk. This material holds the potential to make significant inroads into the technical textiles market.
Our third line of products, which we refer to as “Gen 3 technical and medical fiber,” is designed to move beyond the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of natural spider silk. Gen 3 fibers are in a relatively early stage of development and will incorporate such elements as antibacterial agents for medical use, and metallic ions for use in industrial processes.
More About Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, the Leader in Genetically Engineered Spider Silk

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (KBLB) is a biotechnology company focused on the commercialization and development of spider silk. Kraig is a genetic engineering company working in concert with leading university laboratories. We are a fully reporting, publicly traded company whose shares are traded on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol: KBLB.
The inventor of this technology, Kim Thompson, is the founder and CEO of Kraig. Kraig’s ability to produce spider silk is cost effective, and capable of producing a wide range of proteins and fibers and materials. Teams of other scientist around the world have worked on other ways to produce spider silk including using genetically engineered E.coli bacteria. That work is scientifically sound, but with production costs that could exceed $37,500 per kilogram, it is difficult to see how these programs could capture a significant part of the textile market.[6] Kraig is able to produce its genetically engineered spider silks, including Monster Silk™, at less than 1% of that cost.
In 2013, Kraig successfully completed its pilot production program for its spider silk product, Monster Silk™. We are currently ramping up commercial scale production of Dragon Silk.
On July 12, 2016, we announced our first U.S. Military contract to deliver Dragon Silk™.  Kraig Labs will deliver spider silk-based ballistic shoot packs for performance testing for solider-related protective applications.  Shortly thereafter we announced that we had taken possession of a new production facility in Indiana for the purpose of scaling up production of Dragon Silk and other spider silk based products.
Kraig continues a collaborative research and development effort with The University of Notre Dame. This has resulted in a number of exciting spider silk technological breakthroughs. Those breakthroughs include the development of numerous strains of transgenic silkworm which produce genetically engineered spider silk. Some of our work is reviewed and described in the prestigious peer reviewed science journal PNAS (the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences).

(KBLB) is the first company with a commercially feasible spidersilk to be mass produced.    Kraig Labs is a biotechnology company focused on the development of commercially significant high performance polymers and technical fibers.  Kraig Lab's focus has been on the production of a transgenic silkworm incorporating specific gene sequences from the golden orb weaving spider.  These specific gene sequences inserted are to enable the silkworm to spin a new recombinant fiber which incorporates spider silk proteins.  With the scientific breakthrough announced on September 29, 2010, Kraig Labs is now working to commercialize the transgenic silkworms to compete in the garment industry silk market.  The value for the chinese raw silk market alone is 3-5 billion per annum.  With the creation of 20 seperate transgenic silkworms, all with unique properties, Kraig Labs is now working at an accelerated pace to build upon their first generation transgenic organisms to develop their second generation of transgenic silkworm incorporating spider silk proteins.  The scientists nearly doubled the strength of the silkworm with these specific spider gene insertions.  Their second generation of transgenics are expected to be complete in 2011.  These second generation organisms are to be compared with the strength, flexibility and resiliency of the native spider in which the gene sequences are derived from.  These fibers which will match the strength of spider silk are expected to compete in the technical textiles market valued in excess of 120 billion per annum.  The 3rd generation organisms are currently in the planning phase.  These organisms are expected to spin fibers exceeding the strength of native spiders and may incorporate gene sequences that release an antibiotic, or to help reduce scarring with use in bandages.   Kraig Biocraft Laboratories has a sponsored research and development program with the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Wyoming.  The genetic work is occurring at the University of Notre Dame, headed by Dr Malcolm Fraser, Phd.  The gene sequences are derived from Dr. Randy Lewis's(University of Wyoming) patented gene sequences of the golden orb weaving spider.  Kraig labs is paying for all expenses incurred for this research and development program, and thus Kraig Labs has exclusive global commercialization rights with the technologies developed,  including methods, organisms, and fibers produced.         September 29, 2010 Press Conference Held At Notre Dame                                  Must see Videos:                                                         Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.

He has an unparalleled track record for fostering and managing corporate growth through mergers and acquisitions, as well as through organic growth and global marketing. In fact, he is generally recognized as the principal architect of the successful merger that created SmithKline Beecham. In his term as CEO of the pharmaceutical giant, Wendt focused on a "3 point strategy" to help strengthen the business. His strategy consisted of increasing support of SmithKline's best products, such as Tagamet, weeding out less profitable products, and increasing shareholder value. This strategy lead to the successful merger of SmithKline with UK-based Beecham Company. The creation of SmithKline Beecham (SKB), engineered by Wendt and Beecham's chief, created the world's second largest pharmaceutical company in both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. In addition to his groundbreaking leadership at SmithKline Beecham, Mr. Wendt literally wrote the book on successful strategies for corporate growth in the global marketplace, Global Embrace: Corporate Challenges in a Transnational World, a 'must read' for corporate executives. Mr. Wendt is the Co-Founder of Healthcare Investment Partners, as well as the Founder of Global Health Care Partners. He is a graduate of Princeton University.    Raymond Kutsunai  (announced 11/22/2010)  (no photo available)  Raymond Kutsunai's unique accomplishments and lifetime experiences have enabled him to forge a path that has left his mark on history and international business. Mr. Kutsunai grew up in pre-statehood Hawaii, the geographical and cultural hub that links North America and Asia . When he was a teenager he was sent to Hiroshima to study Japanese and renew his family and cultural ties. Unfortunately, this was just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. He attended high school in Hiroshima. Unable to return to Hawaii during the war, he attended university in Japan. Immediately after the war, Mr. Kutsunai was distinctively positioned to assist both the United States and the people of Japan. Upon his homecoming to the United States , Mr. Kutsunai returned to school and completed his university degree at the University of Michigan . Mr. Kutsunai subsequently rose rapidly through the ranks at SmithKline & French and was named General Manager of SmithKline & French Laboratories Japan. He was able to parlay his business instincts and extensive understanding of the Japanese culture and business environment into stunning successes for the Company's Japanese operations. As remarkable as Mr. Kutsunai's incredible personal and professional experiences have been, they are exceeded by his loyalty to his family, friends, associates and country.

Numerous factors, including negative consumer perception, regulatory hurdles, and limitations inherent to classical GM technologies, have kept the majority of GM animal applications within the realm of academic research. However genome editing using zinc finger nucleases could help develop new markets for the future commercialisation of GM animals.  Genetic modification is commonplace throughout the life sciences sector, from fundamental research to pharmaceutical testing. GM cellular and animal models are valuable tools for the study of many chronic diseases, the testing of pharmaceutical compounds and the development of new therapeutic strategies. Genetic modification also offers great benefits in vaccine and biopharmaceutical manufacturing, which rely heavily on the use of GM organisms for biomolecule design and production. Modifying the genome of an organism or cell line allows the incorporation of target biomolecules in specific biological contexts, as well as the transfer of a gene product from a low-producing organism to one that can produce on a commercial scale. These applications have been widely accepted for many years, with countless GM organisms approved for medical manufacturing applications by drug regulators in all major countries. Despite this widespread success within the research and pharmaceutical sectors, the use of GM organisms outside of these markets has been limited. Despite the lack of broad acceptance for most commercial applications of GM animal products, this technology has been able to gain traction in a few market sectors. The most obvious application has been the commercialisation of transgenic animals for the production of biomolecules for therapeutic use. Cattle, sheep and goats have been used for large-scale production of antibodies, steroids and hormones - most notably insulin - for many years. In 2009, GTC Biotherapeutics received US FDA approval for bioproduction of a recombinant human antithrombin. This product - ATryn - is extracted from the milk of transgenic goats, and is the first approved biopharmaceutical to be produced using genetically engineered animals. Although this is a significant breakthrough for the commercialisation of GM animals, it is still within the pharmaceutical industry, and is a natural progression of existing cell-based technologies. Of potentially greater commercial interest is the extension of genetic engineering outside of this sector, into areas such as food production, textiles and even companion animals. GM crops have been available in many countries since the early 1990s, and numerous cash crops - including sugar beet, soybean, corn and tomatoes - have been modified to improve resistance to disease, increase the rate of growth or enhance nutritional value. However, cultivation of these transgenic crops is generally tightly regulated, particularly within the European Union, and this, together with negative public opinion, has limited the more widespread development of GM technologies. Similar to GM crops, many of the animals currently under development are intended to confer disease resistance, an application particularly suited to the use of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. Many diseases can be treated by the targeted deletion or modification of a host gene. With ZFNs, these targets can be modified with no footprint of genetic engineering. Due to the high costs of raising livestock, another area of focus in developing commercial GM animals has been increasing the rate of growth or size of animals. Among the first GM animals likely to be launched is a fast growing salmon from AquaBounty. The AquAdvantage Salmon is designed to reach market size in half the time of a wild type salmon, reducing costs for fish farmers and limiting the environmental impact of salmon farming by avoiding the need for ocean pens. Although genetic engineering of animals for food is primarily driven by economic pressures, GM technologies have also been used in the companion animals market. In this sector, genetic modification can be used for practical purposes - such as the creation of hypoallergenic animals or the correction of heritable congenital defects which have arisen though inbreeding - or for purely cosmetic purposes, such as GloFish. The first example of a GM pet, GloFish are fluorescent zebrafish (Danio rerio) that have had genes encoding naturally fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, RFP) inserted into their genome. Developed by a group at the National University of Singapore, GloFish were originally created to develop live detection systems for water pollution. They were introduced as pets in the United States in 2003 following over two years of extensive environmental research and consultation. In Europe however, the sale and possession of GloFish is prohibited by rigorous legislation concerning the use of GM technologies.   By allowing precisely targeted insertion of spider genes and concomitant removal of endogenous silkworm silk genes at the same locus, ZFN technology offers the potential for development of transgenic silkworms which will produce native spider silk at commercially viable levels  Perhaps even more interesting from a commercial perspective is the use of GM animals in the manufacture of textiles. Silkworms - actually the larval form of the silkmoth Bombyx mori - have been used for the production of silk for thousands of years, with natural silk still produced by the cultivation of silkworms today. Silkworm cocoons are unwound to create linear silk threads, then re-spun into textiles in much the same way as cotton. Although the applications of silkworm silk are numerous, due to their unique physical and chemical properties, there is also widespread interest in the silks of several other insects. Spider silk, in particular, offers numerous possibilities within the technical textiles industry, due to its incredible tensile strength and elasticity; characteristics which have not yet been replicated in synthetic materials. Like all insect silks, spider silk fibres consist of repetitive units of protein crystals separated by less structured protein chains. The exact properties and composition of each spider silk vary with its intended function. Major Ampullate or dragline silk, for example, is relatively hydrophobic with very high tensile strength and toughness, as it is used to form the outer rim and spokes of a web. In contrast, hydrophilic capture spiral silks, which form the inner structures of the web, are sticky and highly elastic to effectively entrap prey. This high degree of variability offers enormous potential for the textiles industry, raising the possibility of tailoring the properties of silk to create advanced technical fabrics, for applications such as bulletproof vests, parachute canopies and automobile airbags; biomedical applications, including sutures and tendon and ligament repair; new fabrics, for sportswear and clothing; and even microelectronics. Although the use of spider silks for microsutures has recently been reported, more widespread application of spider silk technologies is currently limited by the difficulty in producing silks on a commercially viable scale. This is due to the difficulties of rearing spiders in large numbers, due to their highly territorial and cannibalistic nature. As a result, the harvesting of spider silk fibres is extremely time consuming and labour intensive, with production of the only known spider silk garment - an 11 foot by 4 foot shawl made from golden orb spider silk - taking 150 people over five years to produce and costing in excess of £300,000! . To overcome these limitations, and allow future development of spider silk technologies, an alternative strategy for spider silk production is required. This makes spider silk production an obvious candidate for genetic modification, inserting spider silk genes into the genome of other silk-making insects for bioproduction.  For example, random insertion of orb spider silk genes into silkworms has allowed production of hybrid spider/silkworm silk using traditional silkworm farming strategies. The resulting hybrid silk contains approximately 10% spider silk and has greater strength and durability than native silkworm silk, raising the possibility of using transgenic silkworms to produce pure spider silks.  Though straightforward in principle, the exchange of native silkworm genes for spider silk genes, alongside more widespread exploitation of genetic engineering, has been limited by the inherent restrictions of conventional GM technologies. The generalised process of modifying an organism requires several capabilities, including:    an ability to synthesise or clone the sequence of interest (if transferring genetic information); the capacity to grow and maintain a population of the organism of interest; access to the genome of the organism of interest; a mechanism to select animals that have received the modification of interest.     While many different techniques exist for accomplishing each of these steps, most GM technologies offer a compromise between the efficiency of the technique and the ability to accurately and precisely target the locus of interest. Viral genomic delivery technologies effectively deliver nucleic acids to cells and organisms, but fall short on ability to target specific regions of the genome, generally only allowing random insertion of genetic material. In comparison, transposase technologies allow a greater degree of targeting, but leave unwanted traces of exogenous DNA in their wake. Other methods involve the introduction of naked DNA into the cell, which results in insertion into the genome at very low frequencies, usually at random, limiting this approach to organisms that can be economically cultivated at high densities and screened in large numbers. Simply put, most techniques for genetic manipulation are random, inefficient and leave a 'footprint' of foreign DNA. While this is usually tolerated in basic research, it is not acceptable for most commercial applications, and has been a major hurdle for GM animal technologies to date. The advent of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology represents a significant breakthrough for commercialisation of GM animal products, offering precisely targeted, efficient genome editing for the first time. Commercially available through Sigma Life Science under the CompoZr brand, this technique can be used to create permanent and heritable changes to an organism of interest.  This high degree of variability offers enormous potential for the textiles industry, raising the possibility of tailoring the properties of silk to create advanced technical fabrics   Credit Nir Nussbaum  ZFNs are a class of engineered DNA binding proteins that facilitate targeted editing of the genome by creating double-strand breaks at user-specified locations. These breaks stimulate the cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms - homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) - which can be exploited to achieve rapid and permanent site-specific modification of the desired genes. While HR can be used to insert foreign DNA sequences, NHEJ allows the cell's natural processes to create precisely targeted mimics of natural mutations which leave no traces of foreign DNA. Unlike previous techniques, ZFNs offer excellent sequence specificity, binding 24 to 36 base pair target sequences to virtually eliminate off target effects, and are able to achieve modification rates exceeding 20 %, well above rates for most other technologies. The technique is already being used to create transgenic silkworms for spider silk production. By allowing precisely targeted insertion of spider genes and concomitant removal of endogenous silkworm silk genes at the same locus, ZFN technology offers the potential for development of transgenic silkworms which will produce native spider silk at commercially viable levels. GM technologies have revolutionised the research world and have great potential in a variety of commercial applications, but have been limited by the inherent restrictions associated with historical GM technologies. The main drawback of these technologies is their inability to accurately and efficiently target genes of interest, instead relying on random insertion of genetic material into host genomes. These limitations result in the need for extensive and costly screening to identify animals with correct transgene expression (without compromising the viability of the animal), and also result in the co-expression of both the transgene and native homologues already present. The advent of ZFN technology signifies the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the world of genetic modification, allowing precise, targeted and efficient genome editing for the first time. Production of native spider silk using transgenic silkworms is just one example of the potential commercial applications of this innovative technology, taking us one step closer to the reality of industrial scale biomanufacturing and paving the way for an entirely new spectrum of environmentally friendly materials.

(OTCQB: KBLB) (PINKSHEETS: KBLB) is very happy to start the New Year by announcing that the Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published a peer- reviewed scientific article describing the breakthrough creation of a spider silk fusion fiber, which was achieved by university scientists within the University of Wyoming and the University of Notre Dame, who are working cooperatively with Kraig Biocraft Laboratories.  The article is the first peer-reviewed scientific publication describing the creation of transgenic silkworms, which have been specifically designed to spin a spider/silkworm silk fusion fiber.  The article's abstract states, "these composite fibers were, on average, tougher than the parental silkworm silk fibers and as tough as native dragline spider silk fibers.  These results demonstrate that silkworms can be engineered to manufacture composite silk fibers containing stably integrated spider silk protein sequences, which significantly improve the overall mechanical properties of the parental  silkworm fibers."   "The fact that a publication as prestigious as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has chosen to publish these results speaks for itself as to the significance to the scientific breakthrough, "said Company founder and CEO, Kim K. Thompson.   "When I founded Kraig many people in both business and scientific community said that what we were setting out to do was impossible. By maintaining a focused vision and by recruiting the very best minds in molecular biology, we have made the impossible a tangible reality."  "Congratulations to the scientific team as well as to the University of Notre Dame and the University of Wyoming.  They deserve the accolades they are receiving with this publication,"continued Thompson.  "Our next steps are to commercialize these developments while accelerating our development of even more advanced products.  The commercial license agreement we signed in the fourth quarter of 2011 was an essential element of the former.  As we move toward commercialization of these fibers, we are simultaneously moving into an advanced stage in the development of new, second generation spider silk polymers."  The scientific article described above is published, online before print January 3,2012, by the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, titled,  "Silkworms Transformed with Chimeric Silkworm/Spider Silk Genes Spin Composite Silk Fibers with Improved Mechanical Properties."  "The recent publication of the analysis of genetically engineered silkworms to produce chimeric spider silks with properties of increased strength and flexibility in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science represents a significant vindication of our methodology for genetically engineering and producing commercial quantities of novel protiens for medical, structural, and textile fabrics, "said Dr. Malcom Fraser.  "If it were not for Kraig Biocraft Laboratories initiating this project and bringing the technologies together these results may never have materialized."  "The work is the culmination of a research effort begun more than 10 years ago with an internal award from the University of Notre Dame to my lab to develop silkworm transgenics capabilities, a two year NIH R21 grant awarded to Dr. Jarvis, Lewis, and myself, and several years of supplemental funding from Kraig Biocraft Laboratories,"Fraser continued.  "The success of this research would have been impossible without the ability to carry out silkworm transgenics, mastered by Bong-Hee Sohn and Young-Soo Kim in the Fraser lab at the University of Notre Dame.  This manuscript was published after an in depth peer review process, and was deemed by the publishers as a newsworthy article of the issue in which it appears, further indicating its relative importance to science and technology."

The Company has achieved a number of milestones in late 2011 and during the first two quarters of 2012, starting with the publication of our work on the creation of spider silk based polymers by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That was closely followed-up by Textile World, the prestigious industry publication, featuring our spider silk based polymer, Monster Silk™, as its "technical textile of the month".  The aforementioned publications, as well as many other articles, were important catalysts that focused the spotlight on our work. Following which a number of companies approached us wanting to know if our spider silk based fibers would work in their existing product lines, or to explore the possibility of using our Monster Silk™ to enter into new markets. As discussions with these companies about the potential opportunities progressed, we decided that the best approach to commercializing our Monster Silk™ would be to work cooperatively and collaboratively, possibly on an exclusive basis, with one or two companies with existing market share in our target markets. We currently define those target markets as: military, police and DHS related applications; sportswear; other industrial and consumer applications, clothing and fashion wear; and finally, existing silk product markets.  Initially, our strategy was geared toward identifying potential Monster Silk™ commercialization partners and we've been in discussions with a number of interested companies about incorporating Monster Silk™ into their products. We then exhibited to the technical textile industry at the TechTextil trade show in late April, where Monster Silk™ sparked tremendous interest at the show.  Even though the exhibition exceeded our expectations in terms of the generation of interest and numerous contacts with new potential commercialization partners, which resulted in ongoing negotiations, some may have interpreted the lack of public comment by the Company as an indication that we stopped moving our business plan forward. Nothing could be further from the truth, as we are actually accelerating on all fronts.  The nature of the negotiations we've entered into require extreme discretion due to non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements. While we cannot comment about specific discussions, I can state my personal belief, which is that the first commercial Monster Silk™ agreements will be with military and sportswear producers.  I believe that we are currently on track to enter into memorandums of understanding and letters of intent in the near term, although we continue to receive additional inquiries and we're even in the midst of the negotiating another non-disclosure agreement as I write this letter. We are likely to select one or two defense contractors (or companies that supply defense contractors) and one or two sportswear companies, to receive some degree of partial exclusivity for the commercial development of Monster Silk™ in their respective markets.  We have a once-in-a-lifetime technology. We have taken the first two quarters of 2012 to lay the foundation of our commercialization strategy to ensure that the commercialization agreements we enter into maximize long-term shareholder value. Some of the companies that we've been talking with include household names and well-known brands.  The current negotiations approach is not unlike our bold move to secure the use of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. Although the ZFN technology negotiations with Sigma-Aldrich took time, they yielded impressive results. Because of these actions and others like it, Kraig Biocraft Laboratories was able to accelerate research and development and is now positioned for greater success.  As those of you who closely follow the Company know, we have been working with Sigma -Aldrich's ZFN technology to increase the power of our own technology. In the first half of this year we experimented with the combination of our technology with ZFN. The ZFN has proven to be so powerful that it requires an adjustment in our genetic packets. Our analysis of the data has given us increased confidence that we are on the right track for the development of fibers that are even more advanced than Monster Silk™. While that work is continuing we are also in the later stages of producing more exciting new genetic configurations for use in combination with ZFN.  Until recently all of the Company's laboratory work took place entirely within university laboratories, pursuant to collaborative research agreements, which we renewed with the University of Notre Dame. Even though we increased our financing of the collaborative research project and we are now accelerating our research at Notre Dame, in the second quarter we signed a lease for a laboratory near the university. That was a big step forward in our growth and indicates our commitment to accelerate the development of new spider silk based fibers; because we believe that we are closer to the development of our pure spider silk platform. Our new private laboratory at Innovation Park, a state of the art facility near Notre Dame, is equipped with top of the line security, including bio-sensors, which we feel is more appropriate for our technology at its current state of development.  Kraig Biocraft Laboratories has made great strides and achieved several milestones in the first two and a half quarters of 2012, plus we laid down a very solid foundation for both our commercialization program and for advanced R&D. Laying down that foundation has been grueling work, but, now that the foundation is in place, the next stages of development should be more exciting and tangible.  Our plan is to continue to build on our research knowledge to develop more advanced polymers in the near term. On the Monster Silk™ commercialization front, we are currently in privileged discussions with potential commercialization partners including some medium sized and larger companies. We anticipate that those discussions will bear fruit in the near term.  In short, I am determined to unlock the maximum value for our shareholders. We are delighted with the current positioning of our commercialization opportunities, which we're building on the foundation we laid out in the first half of the year in order to seize those opportunities. I know that this comprehensive approach takes more time, but I'm convinced that we control our own destiny and this will enable us to create far more long-term shareholder value.  Thank you for supporting the Company and taking the time to read this letter. I am very proud of our innovative Company and the ingenious technology we've developed, but I am more confident than ever that Kraig is favorably positioned to become a leading technical materials firm and I am even more intensely excited about the big future that lies ahead for Kraig Biocraft Laboratories.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Announces the Creation of New Recombinant Spider Silks  The New Spider Silks, Which Have an Unusual Red Cast and Were Designed for Superior Strength Are Collectively Designated by the Company as "Big Red"  LANSING, Mich., Jan. 14, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB:KBLB) (the "Company" or "Kraig") announced that researchers, working pursuant to Kraig's collaborative research program, utilizing customized spider silk genetic engineering sequences, succeeded in creating a new type of recombinant spider silk, which the Company is designating as "Big Red." The "Big Red" silk is currently being spun within the laboratory by transgenicly modified silkworms. "'Big Red' is a composite fiber," said Company CEO, Kim Thompson. "This new type of fiber was designed to be a combination of spider silk proteins, silkworm silk proteins and protein from an unrelated species. From a genetic perspective, what significantly differentiates this material from our Monster Silk™ is the unique spider silk genetic sequence that we used, which we designed to increase strength to weight ratios. Another important difference is the incorporation of a unique protein, which gives the new fiber its designation as 'red.'  "The design for 'Big Red' derived from what we learned about the mechanical characteristics of recombinant spider silk fibers from our work with Monster Silk™," continued Thompson. "Specifically, the new fiber was designed to place more emphasis on tensile strength and slightly less emphasis on elongation. We anticipate that 'Big Red' will be a powerful arrow in our quiver as we move to commercialize Monster Silk™ and the Company is hopeful that this new material will follow it in the commercialization pipeline. In my view, the creation of Big Red demonstrates the power of our technology to continue to develop new and exciting materials." The "Big Red" name comes in part from the fact that the fibers have a slight red cast. Under UV light, the new fibers actually glow bright red. Thompson further stated, "The successful creation of these new materials once again validates our scientific models. Based upon the observed levels of color expression and the nature of the spider silk genetic configurations used in its creation, the hope is that it will find its own significant niche in the technical textiles marketplace. Preparation for mechanical testing of the new fiber is currently taking place." About Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.  Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.

(OTCQB:KBLB) (the "Company"), the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers, today announced plans to launch its initial commercial production of Monster Silk™. The announcement of the Company's decision to launch commercial production follows the early successes of its of Monster Silk™ pilot production program.  "We have received strong indications of interest from potential customers and potential commercialization partners," said, CEO and founder, Kim Thompson. "Many of these companies have been very patient with the fact that our laboratory production has been limited and can not satisfy their demand for quantities of material sufficient to run test weaves and end product testing. "Moving from our pilot production program to commercial production is a very big jump, but it is also a natural progression," continued Thompson.  "We have been laying the groundwork for this expansion over the last twelve months. We are confident in the decision and we are hopeful that we can accomplish the launch during the third and fourth quarters. Our plan is to begin commercial production to meet customer needs, secure future orders and capture market share in the technical textiles market." Kraig's pilot production program will continue to run, in order to supply continuing data and help grow the Company's production capacity. About Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.

(OTCQB:KBLB) (the "Company"), the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers, today announced the end of the quiet period phase related to its recently filed S1 financing registration and a second potential financing that the Company has now terminated. "We are very happy to be able to announce the end of this quiet period, and we want to thank our shareholders for their patience," said Company CEO and founder, Kim K Thompson. "Quiet periods during times when certain financings are being prepared are a normal part of the Company's regulatory compliance obligations. While it is wonderful to receive the underlying finance, the quiet periods themselves are an unwelcome, but necessary burden. Having successfully carried that burden, we are now very happy to set it down." During the quiet period, the Company was unable, from its perspective, to effectively disseminate corporate information announcements and public relations announcements. The Company had come to terms with a New York based investment banking firm for a potential financing (in addition to the financing described in the recently filed S1) that would have necessitated a second S1 registration. The Company has determined however that the burden of an additional quiet period, or any further open ended extension of the quiet period, would be too counterproductive. The Company is looking forward to resuming more open communications with the financial markets and shareholders.

(720) 288-8495     Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Announces Monster Silk(TM) Production at Quantities Necessary for Producing Textile Prototypes  Company to Increase Scale of Its Recombinant Spider Silk Production  LANSING, Mich., Aug. 19, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB:KBLB) ("Company"), the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers, today announced that the Company's pilot production program has successfully produced a sufficient quantity of Monster Silk™ cocoons to allow the Company to make the first Monster Silk™ textile prototypes. The cocoons still need to be reeled and processed into yarn before the first prototype and sample textiles can be produced. The announcement puts the Company firmly ahead of its most recent textile production schedule. The first textiles are slated for mechanical testing of the properties of recombinant spider silk in various textile knits and/or weaves. The Company also announced today a change in its production schedule and scale of operations for its initial commercial production program. "The timing of cocoon production from the pilot program worked out well, because we were getting indications from the field that the weather developing in August was not ideal for the mulberry production needed for our commercial launch," said Company founder and CEO, Kim K. Thompson. "We are going to take advantage of the fact that with this supply of cocoons we have bought ourselves some breathing room. The Company plans to delay the launch of commercial production until sometime in September. We can now do this with no expected impact on our schedule to produce new textiles. By moving the production launch to September we may also be in a position to increase the scale of the initial commercial production by a factor of two or more. The Laboratory is taking full advantage of the time by working on egg production in order to increase the scale of the commercial launch." "The pilot production program was the first time that we raised Monster Silk™ silkworms in real world conditions," continued Thompson. "The success of that program has enabled us to prepare for the creation of recombinant spider silk textiles and to increase the scale of our pending launch of spider silk production on a commercial scale."     About Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.

(OTCQB:KBLB) ("Company"), the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers, today announced the launching of the Company's commercial production program with the recent hatching of its first batch of Monster Silk™ silkworms for commercial production.   Furthermore, the Company is currently expending resources to augment the scale of its Monster Silkworm™ production over the next 30 to 90 days. This move coincides with the Company's planned strategy to rapidly increase its production capacity. The Company's strategy is to commit the vast majority of its initial production capacity to a propagation program designed to increase its production population. A smaller portion of the first commercial production generation should also yield fibers which can be dedicated to the production of woven textile samples. "Our launch of our commercial scale production of Monster Silk™ is a long awaited major milestone for Kraig, as we demonstrate our ability to convert recombinant spider silk, and Monster Silk™ most specifically, from an exciting laboratory technology to a marketable product," said, CEO and founder, Kim K. Thompson. "We believe that rolling out the world's first recombinant spider silk commercial production project will only expand our global development prospects, for Monster Silk™ and other high technology fibers."  "It has taken many years to go from my initial concept of recombinant spider silk to the laboratory production of Monster Silk™ and now the actual launch and scaling up of the commercial scale production. I want to thank our investors and, most particularly, the research scientists, whose work and dedication has made this long anticipated day possible." "Given the current planned production schedule, we could theoretically be producing Monster Silk™ in metric ton quantities by early January. A more conservative estimate, given the realities of launching such a ground breaking and commercially unique project, would be to reach that major milestone in mid 2014. This move reaffirms our view that Kraig is the world's leading developer of recombinant spider silk technologies," concluded Thompson.

(OTCQB:KBLB) ("Company"), the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers, announced today that its genetically engineered spider silk, Monster Silk™, production program has more than doubled in productivity. During the pilot production program, the yield rate of viable silk cocoons was approximately 30%. At those rates, the cost structure warranted the conversion of the pilot test program to a much larger scale. The latest reports from the current production ramp up point to a dramatic and unexpected increase in yield to 70%; more than double the output efficiency shown during the pilot phase. The initial assessment from the Company's scientific team is that the Monster Silkworms™ are acclimating to the production environment. "This dramatic boost in productivity was a surprise to us. Our plan was to methodically increase productivity rates over the next 18 months. Our team had drawn up plans that included selective breeding and cross breeding to achieve those goals. To see such a remarkable gain in so short a time was beyond our expectations. The obvious benefits, should these rates continue, would include reduced production costs and reduced ramp up time," said Company Founder and CEO, Kim K. Thompson. "With this doubling in efficiency, we need to focus on emplacing the necessary infrastructure to support the increased productivity. As far as challenges go, these are good problems to have.   We have already taken action to beef up our production infrastructure to support these larger numbers. The improvement in performance is dramatic; but, with such significant advancements I am cautious until I see that results are consistent over the next few months," Thompson concluded.

(720) 288-8495      World's First Monster Silk(TM) Textile Created by Warwick Mills and Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Collaborative Effort  Spider Silk Textile Development Breakthrough  LANSING, Mich., June 18, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB:KBLB) ("Kraig"), the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers, announced today Warwick Mills ("Warwick"), a leader in the engineering and development of advanced technical textiles and protective materials, created the world's first textile utilizing Kraig's genetically engineered spider silk, Monster Silk™. The first Monster Silk™ textiles are knitted gloves and the first photos are available at the following link:  http://www.kraiglabs.com/spider-silk-textiles/  They are considered to be the first of many textiles that are to be created as part of the Company's joint development agreement with Warwick. "We have been working with various types of Monster Silk™," stated Charles Howland, President of Warwick. "We find that all of these fibers are compatible with existing yarn processing and textile formation methods. As is expected, fiber consistency is not yet at fill production levels. However, for the current stage of maturity, these silk materials already have good levels of quality and consistency. We have been making jersey knit samples and will start weaving shortly. These small scale trials are key to helping identify, for Kraig Labs, areas for development for upcoming fiber production trials. We are reviewing textile properties of the samples with Kraig staff and exploring the most attractive applications for this fiber. Overall the trails are well underway and we are making good progress toward commercialization."    "One of the biggest issues facing our Company was creating our first textile and the open question of whether genetically engineered spider silk could be successfully processed using existing textile formation methods," said Company founder and CEO, Kim K. Thompson. "With this successful test, and the creation of the first Monster Silk™ knits, we have established that our genetically engineered spider silk works well with existing manufacturing methods. The creation of these knits is a huge milestone in our progress toward making genetically engineered spider silk available for industrial and consumer applications. The fact that these advanced materials process well on existing machinery will help speed up the development of advanced spider silk textiles." About Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.

(720) 288-8495 ir@KraigLabs.com  August 2015 Newsletter  Dear Friends,  The following letter is the latest news about Kraig Biocraft Laboratories (KBLB) and our spider silk technologies. Thank you for your support and interest in KBLB and spider silk technologies.  Sincerely, Kim Thompson, CEO  Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc.  Kraig's Latest News & Events  Dear Shareholders,  In the coming month we will be moving our corporate office, from our location for the last nine years, at 120N Washington Sq., Lansing, Michigan, as the building is being repurposed. We are taking this opportunity to find a location that better matches our growth plans for Kraig Labs.  Over and above notifying you of our pending move, we would also like to take a moment to provide some additional information on the status of our research and material development efforts.  Big Red  Big Red continues as one of our primary recombinant spider silk gene lines. Similar to our recently announced Dragon SilkTM line, Big Red is specifically designed to have a tensile strength significantly higher than conventional silk. Designed specifically for increased strength with lower elasticity, the Big Red silk line we’ve created remains the ideal material for applications where excessive elasticity would decrease overall performance. As we expand our research and rearing operation we expect that Big Red will be a significant element of that effort.   Laboratory lease  In 2011, we began renting additional laboratory space, at the Innovation Park in South Bend, Indiana. This space was initially intended to provide a secondary location and overflow capacity for the work conducted in the laboratory at Notre Dame, our research center.  The decision to end the long running lease for this second lab was made after review and determining that we could expand our core research by focusing more of our attention into the Notre Dame lab.  By redirecting those resources we are increasing the number of microinjection and incorporate additional gene splicing technologies to further advance our market leading recombinant silk technology.  The increased scope and funding level for our collaborative research project signed in March, of this year, points to that refocus. This initiative helped to promote our research efforts in developing new plasmids, new rounds of microinjections, and incorporating new gene splicing techniques.   Warwick Mill  Through our partnership with Warwick Mills we continue to make progress in developing new woven and knitted materials using our recombinant fiber technologies.  Over the last several months we have engaged with Warwick Mill on an initiative to produce a new material, we believe we will be able to announce the exciting details of that project in the fourth quarter of this year. Warwick Mills remains an important element of our transition from a technology development company into a product delivery company.  We are proud of the technical team’s developments and partners’ progress. We are excited about our results in the lab and pleased with how our business model is evolving. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Announces Signing Hybrid Silk Production Agreement in Vietnam Kraig Labs now preparing for launch of new Vietnamese subsidiary ANN ARBOR, Mich., – February 29, 2016 – Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB) (“Company”), the leading developer of spider silk based fibers, today announced the signing of a cooperative agreement with a governmental entity in Vietnam to develop and produce the Company’s advanced silk technologies.  Under the terms of the agreement Kraig Labs has agreed to form a subsidiary company in Vietnam and to open an advanced hybrid silk research and pilot production operation. Kraig Labs has created an efficient method of producing high strength silks using its innovative genetic engineering technologies.  Demonstrating superior strength and elasticity, in some cases higher strength and elasticity than native spider silks, Kraig Labs’ Dragon SilkTM has the potential to reshape the textile industry.  The research and production agreement announced today lays the groundwork for the production and further development of these advanced hybrid textiles. “This agreement represents a major advancement for Kraig Labs and is the successful culmination of two years of negotiations and many more years of scientific research and development,” said CEO and Founder Kim Thompson. “It is a key milestone in the advancement of our longstanding business plan to bring these advanced materials to the multi-billion dollar marketplace for advanced technical textiles.  It brings us a huge step closer to meeting the demand for our spider silk technologies. This agreement is important because of the tremendous existing silk and textile production infrastructure.  At the same time bringing a new technology and capability to Vietnam.  This agreement was the result of considerable effort by all parties involved and we are pleased to announce today the success of those efforts.  I would like to personally thank our negotiation partners for their dedication in completing this first of its kind international agreement.” The Company is currently in the process of obtaining the necessary approvals for the subsidiary and its operational plan.  Over the next several months the Company plans to finalize the formation of the subsidiary, lease a research and production facility in Vietnam, hire and train local staff, obtain permits, and begin cross breeding its silkworms with local commercial silkworm lines.

Full Subscriber Report



 KBLB is the leader of  Spider Silk Technology.


 Good morning,
Before we get to the comparative analysis of the Spider Silk market, let’s go over a few knowns so everyone is up to speed.
A recent research paper concluded that the Global technical textiles market size in 2014 was USD 143.75BLN
These “Fibers” are currently used in rubber products, composites, construction, protective gear, medical equipment, etc. Almost everything that is man-made.
The report picked out multiple categories for growth in the coming years, indutech, mobiltech, sportech, hometech, buildtech, clothtech, agrotech, packtech, meditech, protech, and others.

 Kraig’s Spider Silk Team
Key industry participants include DuPont, Avintiv, Kusumgar Corporates, SRF, Ahlstrom, Ibena Textilewerke GmbH, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, 3M, SKAPS, Kimberley Clark Corporation, Maccaferri, and Strata Geosystems (India).
Furthermore, these market leaders are constantly seeking sexy acquisitions and partnerships, in hopes of growing their product portfolio and market share.
Over the last five years, a heavy emphasis has been placed on finding replacements that are stronger, more flexible, and biodegradable.
Another exciting development is that all of the large companies now have green divisions devoted to engineering products that are safe for the environment.
Nylon, Polyester, Acrylic, Cullulosic, Polyprop , Rayon, Kevlar are some of the best-known man-made fibers on the market.
I think that quick review helps even my newest subscribers understand the market size, and the types of products Spider Silk could enhance, or replace.



 Along Came a Potential Billion Dollar- Spider Idea.


 Monster Silk(TM) Knitted Textile Magnified 84x Under Green Filter
Scientists touted Spider Silk as the strongest material on earth for many years; many claim that it’s stronger than steel and laud it as the “Holy Grail” of fibers.
But there was no way to reproduce the spider’s web for mass consumption until Kraig Labs hit the scene.

In 2003, Kim Thompson began working on a recombinant Spider Silk platform concept and, in 2005, he engaged Dr. Malcom Fraser to create a transgenic silkworm, which was followed by collaboration agreements with the University of Wyoming and Notre Dame.
Kraig Labs is formed, in 2008 and begins trading under the symbol KBLB.
By 2010, Thompson and Fraser announced, in a joint press conference held at Notre Dame, that their transgenic sequencing worked and his silkworms were, in fact, spinning recombinant Spider Silk.
KBLB discovered how to cost effectively mass produce the “Holy Grail” of fibers and put everyone on notice that socially responsible Spider Silk would soon become a reality.

Competitor matrix


 The “Great Spider Silk Arms Race”


 Monster Silk(TM) Knitted Textile Magnified 300x Under Green Filter
Yes… some people didn’t get the MEMO.  Over the last couple years, while KBLB’s been quietly perfecting and planning its commercialization program, other companies have entered the Spider Silk market.
When you have the “Holy Grail” of fiber technology, and Billions of dollars are at stake, you have to always expect some competing ideas.

 KBLB isn’t just the leader because they were first!
 Since Kraig’s announcement in 2010 multiple companies has raised hundreds of millions of dollars trying to compete with Kraig Labs (KBLB).
AMSILK, SPIBER, and BOLT threads utilized the hype that Kraig created to raise large sums of money, in hopes that their products can compete with KBLB.
Before I get into the details of what this report means, I want to remind you what it takes to have a successful business.
You must have a market for the product, you must be able to produce it for a profit, and you must be able to produce it in an environmentally responsible manner.
Very simplistic, but sans all of these core values, a business will soon shut down.
Cost is typically the main factor in any business. After all, in order for a company to exist, its products must make money.
Amazon may be the only company to go against this model, but raising 50 billion dollars, or some crazy amount, allowed them to take a beating while eating up market share.  None in this space is close to raising that kind of money yet.
So……
Kraig Labs, to date, raised around 5million USD and has a valuation of around 15-20 million USD; give or take, depending on the trading day.
Bolt raised 90Million USD privately giving it a valuation of around 200million.
SPIBER sold 12% for 28million USD valuing it around $230million USD.
And AMSILK, which published limited funding information, but, as you can see in the report, its valuation is about $100milion USD.
From an opportunity standpoint, it’s easy to see that KBLB has the edge here, as the stock is cheap compared to any of its competitors. Especially since BOLT, AMSILK, and SPIBER will, most likely, need to raise more capital and have no exit strategy for investors.



 Based on these numbers, KBLB should be priced at around 25 cents today.


 Monster Silk(TM) Knitted Textile
It’s currently sitting below a nickel and it’s the only spider silk company that you can invest in- Unless you’re a wealthy banker type.

The RISK/REWARD category goes to KBLB, as there is significant upside for investors who buy or get in this Biotechnology stock now.
In fact, misread biotechs can offer the best risk reward scenarios, because the market eventually figures out the company’s prospects. Think about how Celator Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CPXX) was similarly oversold to the point that, just a few weeks ago, you could have picked up shares for just over a buck, but then the CPXX published favorable study data, followed by Jazz’ (NASDAQ: JAZZ) $1.5B buyout offer, a cool $30.25/share and, just like that, another biotech grand slam. So, consider that KBLB completed enough R&D to start production. They’re already producing sample fibers for potential customers and collaborative partners, but they’re going to increase production and, with that, the sales are sure to follow.



 SPIBER, BOLT, and AMSILK are still working on their production process.


 Monster Silk(TM) Knitted Textile
All three of these companies’ synthetic spider silk fibers require some type of fermentation, which, unlike beer, also involves multiple production steps and some use of hazardous chemicals for finalizing the product.
The best current estimates from the protein production industry indicate that a 1,000 liter batch of GMO yeast or bacteria used to excrete recombinant protein could cost anywhere from $700,000 to $1,000,000 to produce and manage. At a high protein yield of 20 grams of usable silk protein per liter of solution, this could cost anywhere from $35,000 to $50,000 per kilogram of silk protein. These costs do not even include the cost of other items and processes, like silk protein purification and wet-spinning the protein globs.
These additional steps are all required further down the production process before you ever get to usable silk fibers. Now just to reiterate KBLB’s Spider silk is all natural, created by Silkworms, so Kraig’s method uses a technology that has existed and been proven for thousands of years.
Kraig’s production process is as simple as growing and feeding white mulberry leaves to its proprietary silkworms and harvesting recombinant spider silk directly from the cocoons. Using this technique, economical silk production can be done for significantly less than $300 per kilogram compared to the reported $35,000 to $50,000 per kilogram cost for the fermentation approach.
So KBLB beats all of the competition by miles.  They will need to develop a new way of fermentation that is way more cost effective, just to think about being anywhere near KBLB’s production cost structure.



 WHO CAN AFFORD TO COMPETE WITH KRAIG?


  Monster Silk(TM) Knitted Textile
What about all the money raised and future monies that will need to be raised? When BOLT, SPIBER and Amsilk burn through their cash trying to produce Synthetic Spider Silk, KBLB will be producing an all-natural, and feasible, version of Spider Silk, it will be hard to imagine anyone else competing with them.
Nexia had Spider Silk Goats, and they blew almost a hundred million dollars of investors’ money, giving the last spider milk goats to the Museum.
All told, KBLB looks like it will produce the world’s strongest, lowest cost, only peer reviewed, publicly reported recombinant spider silk.
Kraig Biocraft Laboratories (KBLB) remains the only publicly traded spider silk company on the planet. The only company to subject to scientific peer review process and publish that work before the National Academy of Sciences’ PNAS Journal. Plus, it’s the only spider silk company to publicly file SEC quarterly reports and annually file audited financials, as well as the only company to publicly report our material performance specifications.
Now you know why it’s the only company to disclose its production cost structure.
So if you’ve read all of this, and understand what KBLB’s technology really means for this market, you may agree with me, that this is the biggest Biotechnology Stock play in years.
How is any company going to be able to compete with higher performance at much better price points?
Adding KBLB to your portfolio may be the smartest trade you make all year, don’t miss out on upcoming catalysts and events that should drive this market.
I’ve covered 100’s of companies over the years and I truly believe that KBLB has more potential for success than any company I’ve ever written about.
Don’t just take my word on it; go read the news, read the market analysis, read the recent fund paper with all of the Universities and Government that are combining a few hundred million dollars for the development of Technical Fibers.
KBLB is the only Venture Market Biotechnology stock everyone can afford, and should own.
