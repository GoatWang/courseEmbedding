Tune in August 2 at 11am PST/2pm EST
Reserve your spot













We’re the  plug and play guys.
BuildPulse software is a cloud based solution that rapidly ties into your building automation system – taking all of the existing data that you have today and using it to proactively identify issues and faults, prioritize your workflow, and enable your staff to fix problems and increase wrench time with the needed visibility and verification.




 






Discover how professionals use BuildPulse to drive change.
Leverage analytics to simplify and hit your goals, whatever your discipline.
Facility Managers  Energy Managers  Commissioning Agents







Maximize your staff
Help your team make the switch to proactive maintenance by automating the grunt work. Using automated logic to free up time, your team is enabled to get ahead of the curve and focus on higher value projects.



“It’s definitely a conversation starter. There’s nothing like an image to make an impact compared to just a discussion.”
Mike Pumroy, Energy Manager at Macalester College


























Get the most out of your current equipment

Protect your capital investments and avoid unexpected budget stress by keeping a pulse on your equipment health 24/7. With software that monitors thousands of pieces of equipment every 5 minutes, your team can adhere to equipment runtimes, proactively identify problems, and ultimately maximize your equipment’s lifetime.
“We can be more proactive and can catch issues within a week instead of things going on for maybe years before we discover that there’s a problem.” 
Adam Kohler, UNH Campus Energy Manager






















Keep your occupants comfortable
Reduce comfort complaints and resolve issues at the source instead of getting stuck in reactive mode, constantly putting out fires. Use actionable data to address underlying problems and keep your occupants happy.   
“There is improved stratification across campus, and the rooms are heating much better. That is a huge improvement. It’s helped warm up rooms faster and thus shorten our possible start times.”
Rick Smith, Controls Technician at the University of Gonzaga






























Hit energy goals

With the ability to prioritize cost savings opportunities, your team can identify low hanging fruit and make the highest impact changes first. Getting full visibility into all of your systems enables your team to hit energy goals in your building portfolio.
“The system provides avoided cost estimates to help us target the items with the biggest energy impact first.”
Adam Kohler,UNH Campus Energy Manager

Success Stories at a Glance

 


How Energy Managers use BuildPulse to hit goals
There are many ways to approach any problem on campus – the key is to find the solution that’s efficient, attainable, and clear. Mike Pumroy, the Energy Manager at Macalester College, makes informed decisions, designs energy initiatives, and makes an impact on campus with BuildPulse analytics. 
“The data’s there and I can run it on the fly.” – Mike Pumroy, Energy Manager at Macalester College
Macalester College Case Study

 
Making an impact and keeping occupants comfortable
BuildPulse adds value and helps the team at Gonzaga University contribute to the GU mission by augmenting the existing BAS software, supporting facility and energy managers to proactively identify and mitigate issues, and providing its unique plug and play aspect with only a 3 week installation process.
“What’s more important is the mission. If this product can support the mission, that’s more important – allowing the students to be successful in their academic endeavors is our ultimate goal.” – Tomson Spink, Facility Maintenance Manager at Gonzaga University
GU Case Study

 
Driving change at the University of New Hampshire with modern analytics.




The University of New Hampshire wanted their team to spend more time fixing issues and less time looking for them. BuildPulse’s automated data collection and fault diagnostics reduces the time spent hunting for issues by the team. This, alongside the cost savings analysis, extended trend logging, and collaborative service, makes BuildPulse a valuable tool for the UNH team.




“We can be more proactive and can catch issues within a week instead of things going on for maybe years before we discover that there’s a problem.” – Adam Kohler, UNH Campus Energy Manager

HVAC Controls





BuildPulse


This plug-and-play building automation solution pulls data from existing BAS setups (including HVAC, lighting, and submeters) and automatically creates an algorithm with standardized data to streamline analysis.
Users can obtain detailed reports without investing time in setting up trends or adding equipment. Automated reporting finds faults, detects which pieces of equipment cost the most, and suggests ways to lower costs. Audits ensure buildings are running as expected.
