George Batsakis 

























You are hereHome > Our Company > Leadership > George Batsakis 
 











          As Chief Growth Officer for CSRA, George Batsakis sets the company's growth, supporting technology, and business development strategy. He leads integrated growth teams at the corporate and group levels that include business development, capture operations, solution development, proposal management and pricing organization which serve the defense, intelligence, health and civil, homeland security, and law enforcement markets.         







With more than 20 years of government-related systems development and lifecycle management experience, George has led large-scale information technology programs and managed diverse project portfolios which have enhanced his understanding of the complex mission critical needs of the DoD, the Intelligence Community, and civilian agency environments.
Prior to his current position, George was the executive vice president for SRA International’s National Security Group and led the company's defense, intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement-related business. He was responsible for new business acquisition and contract execution in those market areas. In this role, he managed group performance and drove strategy, planning and execution. George was also responsible for technology development; program cost, schedule and performance; technical assurance; human resource management and staffing; and resource management.
George joined SRA International in 2007 from Northrop Grumman, where he served as an operating unit vice president leading business development activities. Prior to that, he held positions with increasing responsibility in information technology; communications and networking; and logistics systems at Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and Teledyne Industries, Inc.
After graduating from Hillsdale College where he studied political science and history, he attended the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School and served as an Infantry Officer in the U.S. Army and in various command and staff positions at the company and field grades in the U.S. Army National Guard. He holds a master's degree in business from John's Hopkins University with a specialization in operations research and systems analysis, as well as program management certification in acquisition management from the Defense Systems Management College. He also has attended executive education programs at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business.
When George is outside of the office, he enjoys reading about history, technology, business and health. He also likes spending time with his wife, kids and dogs and likes listening to podcasts. His dream job would be a lifeguard working on Dewey Beach in Delaware.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Batsakis v. Demotsis Case Brief - QuimbeeSolutions for:Law SchoolsLaw FirmsSign up through your institutionBatsakis v. DemotsisCourt of Civil Appeals of Texas226 S.W.2d 673 (1949)FactsOn April 2, 1942, George Batsakis (plaintiff) offered Eugenia Demotsis (defendant) 500,000 drachmas if she would sign a letter agreeing to pay him back the sum of $2,000 in American currency at a future date, with eight percent interest per year added from 1942. Batsakis later brought suit to recover on the signed agreement. In her answer, Demotsis alleged that the agreement failed for lack of consideration because the actual value of the 500,000 drachmas provided to her by Batsakis was only $25. The trial court held for Batsakis and awarded him a $750 principal, plus interest at the rate of eight percent per year from 1942 to the judgment date, or $1163.83 total. Batsakis appealed.Rule of LawThe rule of law is the black letter law upon which the court rested its decision.
