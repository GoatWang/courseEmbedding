Overview
                    Designed from the ground up as a totally optimized LED street and area lighting system, the XSP Series delivers incredible efficiency without sacrificing application performance. Beyond substantial energy savings and reduced maintenance, Cree achieves greater optical control with our NanoOptic® Precision Delivery Grid™ optic when compared to traditional cobra head luminaires.

Benefits of LED Lighting
LED light bulbs can save you money not only because they are roughly 80% more energy efficient than other bulbs, they also produce far less heat than metal halides, CFLs, and incandescent light bulbs. Upgrading to LED lighting means you won’t spend your summer months cooling down rooms that your light bulbs are busy heating up. While originally a cooler blue tone than incandescent bulbs, LEDs now come in daylight and warm white color temperatures so you can more easily replace your existing bulbs without altering the color of your room. Visit our Lighting Guide to see what difference color temperature makes. LED lighting also offers a superior color rendering index (CRI), so you can see the colors of your artwork or makeup more accurately.
LED replacement bulbs are durable and ecologically friendly. Did you know you can recycle LED bulbs and reduce your carbon footprint up to one third? LEDs outlast the competition, staying bright for up to 11 years of continuous operation. This means less time climbing ladders trying to replace those hard to reach bulbs in vaulted ceilings. 
 LEDs are one of today’s most promising technologies.

No mercury, making them a cleaner alternative to fluorescent and CFL lamps.
The lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date.
Light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products.
Life that is 20 times than some traditional lighting products.



LEDs or Fluorescents - Which is More Efficient?


LED light bulbs for the win! When it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, LEDs surpass CFLs by a wide margin. LEDs are instant-start with no warmup time needed. They work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. From standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, LEDs can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. As an added bonus, all LEDs are RoHS compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs.

LED Lighting Options




Standard Shape A19
 - Designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. Standard and A-shape LED bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights.



3-Way LED
 - A three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. If your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you.



Vintage LED Bulbs
- Vintage reproduction bulbs are now available with LED filament. They have a warm orange glow with lower light levels to mimic the style of a vintage bulb on a dimmer as it transitions from yellow to orange. These
Edison style and
Victorian style bulbs make great collector items. Order yours today to make your own steampunk lighting.



Wet Location LED Bulbs
 - A wet location UL rating means these LED light bulbs can be used in humid indoor areas or outdoors where water may drop or flow against the bulb or fixture.



Decorative LED Bulbs
 - Browse
LED globe lights ranging from 3 in. to 1.5 in. diameters or find LED replacement bulbs for your
chandelier light bulbs. The long life of LEDs mean less time on the ladder changing burnt out bulbs. Many LED chandelier lights are dimmer switch compatible and come in a range of color temperature so you can still enjoy the ambiance of traditional bulbs but the energy savings of LEDs.



LED Tubes
 - LED tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. Ranging in size from T5 to T12 and a variety of color temperatures, these LED tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. Some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to LED lighting easier than ever. These LED tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent T8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. LED tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light.



LED Tape Lights
 - For accents, alcove, and backlighting, LED tape light is a fantastic choice. More flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of LED tape light can bring any place to life. There are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source.



Shatter Resistant LED Bulbs
 - Dipped in a special coating, these bulbs may still break if dropped, but they won’t shatter into pieces and fly across your floor. We recommend not dropping them, but if you do, these make cleanup quite a bit easier.



LED Night Lights
 - Keep the monsters away with LED night lights. Motion activated, and battery powered, these LED bulbs will light the way to the bathroom or give reassurance that nothing is lurking under the bed when your child needs to reach for a dropped retainer or teddy bear. Mounted using tape or screws, light only the area you need without waking sleeping babies.



Reflectors
 - From the powerful flood and spot lights, to home bound recessed or track lights, reflectors find excellent use indoors or out. LED reflector lamps can provide the same brilliance for less energy and will create far less heat than an incandescent or halogen lamp. As a bonus, they have a higher CRI than fluorescent reflectors for better colors.


Shop by Brand - Shop top brands for LED light bulbs including
Cree and
Soraa. Watch installation videos for help retrofitting an existing structure or give us a call to talk to a licensed electrician.



Things to Consider When Buying LED Lighting




Equivalent Wattage - While lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. Comparing an LED bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. As a very ballpark figure for LED wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need.


Lumens - Lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. On average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. The variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. LEDs are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb.


Color Temperature - Your guide to how the light itself will look. Lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000K being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000K will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. Our  Lighting Guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen.
        

Driver Content - Because of their design, LEDs do not typically run on AC voltage.  Many LEDs require some form of 
            driver to convert the voltage from AC to DC for proper operation.  The majority of socket-based LED lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an LED and a 
            driver
             at the same time if it isn't self-driven.

Lighting that saves you money. Our energy-saving compact fluorescents and LED bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment.

Selecting the Right Bulb
Incandescent
Incandescent bulbs, which provide most home lighting, are used in products from nightlights to floodlights. The most common incandescent is a pear-shaped (A19) bulb with a medium-sized screw-type base. Incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot, producing light. About 90 percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat. This style typically burns for 750 to 10,000 hours.
Halogen
Halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with Halogen gas, which emits a bright white light. Long life and full spectrum Halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. The life of these bulbs is around 2,000 to 10,000 hours or two to five years.
Linear Fluorescent
Linear fluorescent bulbs, also known as fluorescent tubes, are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they don't produce much heat. These are the thin, long tube lights often found in kitchens for under-cabinet lighting, or in garages, workshops, and basements. The tubes can last from 10,000 to 44,000 hours—10 to 40 times longer than incandescent lights. Fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts.
Compact Fluorescent
Compact fluorescents, also known as CFLs, provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth of the energy. For example, a 15-watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Compact fluorescent bulbs last about 10,000 hours—10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
High Intensity Discharge
High intensity discharge, or HID, bulbs include metal halide, high pressure sodium, and mercury vapor lights. As their name implies, HID bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power. They are a mainstay of parking lot, street, and warehouse lighting. Like fluorescent bulbs, HID bulbs also require a ballast.
Stage and Studio
Stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized, high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio. Traditionally, these bulbs have used Halogen or HID technology, though LED stage lights are becoming more common.
Miniature Indicator
Miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels. Though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs, you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb.
Automotive
Automotive bulbs include everything from Halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between. No matter the make or model of your car, we have the bulb that fits.

Halogen Light Bulbs Terms and Definitions: Halogen Floods & Spots: Halogen floods are available in both "heavy" glass and "soft" glass. The heavy glass halogen flood light bulbs are commonly referred to as "PAR" lamps. PAR stands for parabolic aluminized reflector. These halogen light bulbs are used both indoors and outdoors. Halogen light bulb PAR lamps are the only halogen flood that may be directly exposed to inclement weather, as the thick glass prevents cracking. PAR flood halogen light bulbs are available in diameters from 1.75" to 4.75". As a general rule of thumb, if the glass covering the PAR lamp is dimpled then the bulb has a wider (flood) beam spread. PAR lamps with a narrow beam (spots) have smooth glass covering the reflector.  Soft glass halogen floods look identical to standard incandescent floods (generally called either "R shape" or "BR shape". These halogen light bulbs should be used either indoors or in fixtures protected from direct weather exposure. Weather your halogen flood is a PAR, R, or BR the diameter of the bulb may be found in the item number directly following the PAR, R, or BR designation. Halogen light bulbs, like incandescent light bulbs, are measure in 1/8" increments. For example a PAR30 halogen light bulb is 30/8" diameter, or 3.75". J Type Halogen Light Bulbs: J type halogen light bulbs are double ended halogen light bulbs. The most common base type for J type halogen light bulbs is called a "recessed single contact" (often abbreviated RSC). The bulb shape is referred to as "T3" for "tubular" (T) and 3/8" diameter. J type halogen light bulbs are also available in "Pin Blade" base (PB). Pin Blade J types have a flat piece of metal at each end used to make contact with the socket (this type of halogen light bulb is becoming increasingly uncommon). J type halogen light bulbs are available in various voltages, from 12 volt to 277 volt, and in lengths from 78mm (3.12") to 254mm (254mm). J type halogen light bulbs are most commonly used in security lighting and in high-end accent fixtures.  Please note that J type halogen light bulbs should not be touched with bare skin. Halogen light bulbs utilize a semi-permeable glass with can be penetrated by oil from skin. The oil creates hot spots on the glass that reduces the bulb's life. JC Type Halogen Light Bulbs: JC type halogen light bulbs are low voltage halogen capsules with pins on the base (voltage ranges from 6 volt to 28 volts). These halogen light bulbs may be found in several applications including puck lights, under-counter lights, landscape lighting, desk lamps, display lighting, and accent lighting. JC type halogen light bulbs have either G4 or GY6.35 bases. G4 base JC type light bulbs measure 4mm between the pins, and GY6.35 base bulbs measure 6.35mm between pins. JC type halogen light bulbs are available in both clear and frosted glass.  Please note that JC type halogen light bulbs should not be touched with bare skin. Halogen light bulbs utilize a semi-permeable glass with can be penetrated by oil from skin. The oil creates hot spots on the glass that reduces the bulb's life. JCD Type Halogen Light Bulbs: JCD type halogen light bulbs are line voltage (120-130 volt) halogen capsules with pins on the base. These halogen light bulbs may be found in puck lights, under-counter lights, desk lamps, pendant lighting, and accent lighting. JCD type halogen light bulbs have either GY6.35, G8, or G9 bases. The GY6.35 base measures 6.35mm between pins, while the G8 base measures 8mm between pins. G9 base JCD type halogen light bulbs have two loops on the base instead of straight pins, and they have become increasingly popular. JCD Type Halogen Light Bulbs are available with both clear and frosted glass. Please note that JCD type halogen light bulbs should not be touched with bare skin. Halogen light bulbs utilize a semi-permeable glass with can be penetrated by oil from skin. The oil creates hot spots on the glass that reduces the bulb's life. JD Type Halogen Light Bulbs: JD type halogen light bulbs are tubular shaped and run on line voltage (120-130 volts). These halogen light bulbs are used in light pendants, table lamps, ceiling fans, and high-end decorative lighting. JD type halogen light bulbs have double contact bases (called DC or BA15d), mini-candelabra bases (E11), or European bases (E14)(base chart). JD type halogen light bulbs are available with both clear and frosted glass. Please note that JD type halogen light bulbs should not be touched with bare skin. Halogen light bulbs utilize a semi-permeable glass with can be penetrated by oil from skin. The oil creates hot spots on the glass that reduces the bulb's life. JDD Type Halogen Light Bulbs: JDD type halogen light bulbs have a glass enclosed halogen filament which is surrounded by a second glass jacket. Most JDD type light bulbs are medium base (standard light bulb base size). JDD type halogen light bulbs are used most commonly in food service applications, but they may also be used in some general lighting applications.  JDR Type Halogen Light Bulbs: JDR type halogen light bulbs are small halogen reflector floods with either a screw-in or GU10 base. These halogen light bulbs are similar in appearance to MR16 style halogen light bulbs. JDR type halogen light bulbs with screw-in bases come in either intermediate base (E17) or medium base (E26). JDR type halogen light bulbs are used in curio cabinets, range hoods, and track lighting. These halogen light bulbs are available with or without cover glass and in both frosted and clear. Chroma High Performance/KX-2000: These light bulbs look and perform like JD type halogen light bulbs, and are available with E11 (mini-candelabra), E12 (candelabra), E17 (intermediate), DC (BA15d), and E26 (medium) bases. They are also known as KX-2000 Lamps or Krypton Filled Lamps. The advantages of these bulbs over halogen is longer life, cooler burning temperature, and glass that can be handled with bare skin. Chroma High Performance/KX-2000 lamps are available in both clear and frosted glass. MR8 Halogen Light Bulbs: MR8 Halogen Light Bulbs are 1" diameter reflector type light bulbs with 2 pins on their base. MR8 light bulbs are low voltage (6, 12, or 24 volts) and have G4 bases (4mm between pins). These halogen light bulbs have beam spreads from 9 to 26 degrees. MR8 light bulbs are found in fiber-optic decorations, novelty lamps, fountains, display cases, and track lighting.  MR11 Halogen Light Bulbs: MR11 Halogen Light Bulbs are 11/8" (1 3/8") diameter reflector type light bulbs with 2 pins on their base. MR11 light bulbs are low voltage (between 6 and 24 volts) and have either a DC (BA15d) or G4 base (sometimes called a GZ4). These bulbs are often listed by a 3 letter code called an ANSI Code (i.e. FTD, GBF) that identifies the bulbs wattage, voltage, base, and beam spread. MR11 Halogen Light Bulbs are used for fiber-optic decorations, novelty lamps, fountains, display cases, track lighting, and landscape lighting. Like MR8 light bulbs, MR11 light bulbs are available in a variety of beam spreads. MR16 Halogen Light Bulbs: MR16 Halogen Light Bulbs are 2" diameter reflector type light bulb with 2 pins on their base. MR16 light bulbs are available in both low voltage (6-24 volts) and line voltage (120-130 volts). Like MR11 light bulbs, MR16 light bulbs are often listed by a 3 letter code called an ANSI Code (i.e. BAB, EXN) that identifies the bulbs wattage, voltage, and beam spread. MR16 halogen light bulbs have become extremely popular for use in track lighting, can lighting, display lighting, and landscape lighting. MR16 lights bulbs have pins that are either 5.3mm or 8mm apart, and they are available in a wide range of beam spreads. R111 Halogen Light Bulbs: R111 Halogen Light Bulbs are 111mm (4.37") diameter reflector style light bulbs with a GU10 base. These bulbs are a 120 volt equivalent to AR111 light bulbs. R111 Halogen light bulbs offer precise beam patterns with no "hotspots". BT15 Shape Halogen Light Bulbs: BT15 Halogen Light Bulbs are primarily used as a replacement for standard incandescent A19 light bulbs. They are used wherever one desires higher light output than is available from standard incandescents. BT15 light bulbs have a medium, standard light bulb, base and are available with clear or frosted glass. Halogen Ball Lites: Halogen Ball Lites are decorative halogen globes with pins on the base. They are 14/8" diameter and have pins 5.3mm apart. They are used primarily on pendant lights or as a replacement for MR16s where directional light is not desired. Low Voltage Xenon Light Bulbs and Line Voltage Xenon Light Bulbs Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are great alternatives to halogen light bulbs for virtually all applications. Almost all halogen bulbs may be replaced with xenon light bulbs. Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are available in several base types, including G4, GY6.35, G8, wedge, rigid loop, festoon, mini-candelabra (E11), candelabra (E12), and D.C. base (BA15d). There are several advantages to using low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs: Long Life: Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs last up to 20,000 hours. Compare the long life of low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs to halogen light bulbs, usually rated for 2,000 hours, and you will find that xenon light bulbs are both economical and convenient. Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are especially useful in fixtures that are difficult to reach or hard to change. Easier Installation: Handling halogen light bulbs with bare hands drastically reduces the life of the bulb. Unlike halogen light bulbs, low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs may be handled with bare hands. With low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs you will never again have to wear gloves or use cloth and paper towels to change your light bulbs. Tolerates Unstable Voltage: Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are less likely to burn out when exposed to unstable voltage. This makes low voltage xenon bulbs especially well suited to marine applications where boats are notorious for irregular voltage. UV Rays: Unlike halogen light bulbs, low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs do not emit UV rays. This quality makes low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs ideal for use around sensitive fabrics and artworks. Low Pressure: In contrast to halogen light bulbs, low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs operate under low pressure, similar to incandescent.

Almost all halogen bulbs may be replaced with xenon light bulbs. Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are available in several base types, including G4, GY6.35, G8, wedge, rigid loop, festoon, mini-candelabra (E11), candelabra (E12), and D.C. base (BA15d). There are several advantages to using low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs: Long Life: Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs last up to 20,000 hours. Compare the long life of low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs to halogen light bulbs, usually rated for 2,000 hours, and you will find that xenon light bulbs are both economical and convenient. Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are especially useful in fixtures that are difficult to reach or hard to change. Easier Installation: Handling halogen light bulbs with bare hands drastically reduces the life of the bulb. Unlike halogen light bulbs, low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs may be handled with bare hands. With low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs you will never again have to wear gloves or use cloth and paper towels to change your light bulbs. Tolerates Unstable Voltage: Low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are less likely to burn out when exposed to unstable voltage. This makes low voltage xenon bulbs especially well suited to marine applications where boats are notorious for irregular voltage. UV Rays: Unlike halogen light bulbs, low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs do not emit UV rays. This quality makes low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs ideal for use around sensitive fabrics and artworks. Low Pressure: In contrast to halogen light bulbs, low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs operate under low pressure, similar to incandescent.
