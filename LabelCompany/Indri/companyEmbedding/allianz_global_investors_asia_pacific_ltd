Outlook & Commentary



 Mid-Year Outlook: Be More Selective in the Second Half 


After a strong first half to 2017 for equities, the message for the remainder of the year is to look for returns more carefully in the second half. The “country factor” will be key: Investors can no longer rely on a rising tide of cyclical data to lift all boats.

 Five Reasons to Consider European Equities 


The "United States of Europe" (USE) has been a work in progress since the end of World War II, when the region started the long, painful task of reunification and rebuilding.

Outlook & Commentary



 Three Reasons to Get Active 


It is well-known that the active management industry has recently encountered its share of challenges. In the United States in 2016, USD 500 billion moved into passively managed index funds, while USD 340 billion exited actively managed funds.















Outlook & Commentary



 How to Prepare for Inflation’s Inevitable Return

                                            Robo-Advisors: Early Disruptors in Private Wealth Management 
                                        


Although some view robo-advice as a passing trend, it has the potential to help investors and advisors alike, according to two new Grassroots Research surveys. Some advisors are even using the technology to manage smaller accounts more efficiently, which could bring more investors into the advice realm.

                                            The Economics of Populism
                                        


In a clear signal from voters who feel left behind by globalization, populist political parties have been gaining ground around the world. This could create serious long-term headwinds for economies and markets, including lower growth and higher inflation.

Moon Jae-in was elected to office thanks to an ambitious reform agenda that clearly resonated with voters. But first he must wrestle with his predecessor’s legacy of corruption, new threats from the north and a strong opposition party.

5 Reasons to Expect Higher Oil Prices

Despite a recent bout with plunging prices, we believe the oil market should grind higher thanks to solid global demand, renewed supply constraints and still-significant underinvestment. This builds a clear case for investing in the energy sector, both for income and for capital return.

It's funny to say I love knowing that I don't know what the day holds for me. Every day that I come in, I am not quite sure what I'll be working on. I'll have a general idea of how I may spend 20% or 30% of my time, but the rest of my day is really up to our clients and it's really up to my colleagues.

Key developments in our company’s history
125 years after its foundation, our parent company Allianz SE is one of the world's strongest financial communities with  82 million clients in 70 countries. The Group -  including Allianz Global Investors -  is one of the key global players in asset management.




































1890 – 1985


Allianz was founded in 1890. By the beginning of the 1920s, it already offered all the property insurance policies typical of the times. 1922 Allianz Life was founded and soon became one of Germany’s largest life insurers.


After reconstruction and the economic miracle in Germany following the end of World War II, Allianz became Europe’s largest insurance company in the early 1970s.
To ensure Allianz’s ability to act internationally, the holding company Allianz AG was created in 1985 (today Allianz SE).



















1998 – 2001


In 1998, driven by the globalization of financial markets, Allianz defined asset management as a core business activity and started to build a global asset management business.

This was achieved through both organic growth as well as the takeover of well-established investment management companies. In the US, these included the purchase of PIMCO Group (2000), including NFJ Investment Group and Oppenheimer Capital, as well as Nicholas-Applegate (2001). In Europe, Dresdner Asset Management Group, including Dresdner RCM Global Investors, was purchased in 2001.



















2002 - 2012


Over time, these asset management businesses started to be gradually integrated under the name of Allianz Global Investors, including COMINVEST, a leading German asset management company, which was integrated in 2009.

In 2012, Allianz’s new organizational structure, establishing PIMCO and Allianz Global Investors as two strong, separate investment management pillars, came into place.



















Today


Today, Allianz Global Investors is a global asset management company with offices throughout Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. 

The firm’s philosophy “Understand. Act.” is deeply embedded within its business. Allianz Global Investors offers its clients a  wide range of actively managed strategies and solutions across the risk / return spectrum which has been further enhanced in 2016 through the  acquisition of the global fixed-income specialist Rogge Global Partners (RGP).

Outlook & Commentary



 Mid-Year Outlook: Be More Selective in the Second Half 


After a strong first half to 2017 for equities, the message for the remainder of the year is to look for returns more carefully in the second half. The “country factor” will be key: Investors can no longer rely on a rising tide of cyclical data to lift all boats.















View from the Global Strategist



 Five Reasons to Consider European Equities 


The "United States of Europe" (USE) has been a work in progress since the end of World War II, when the region started the long, painful task of reunification and rebuilding.

 Three Reasons to Get Active

Outlook & Commentary



 How to Prepare for Inflation’s Inevitable Return 


Powerful interactions between domestic and global forces continue to suppress inflation rates around the world.

Although some view robo-advice as a passing trend, it has the potential to help investors and advisors alike, according to two new Grassroots Research surveys. Some advisors are even using the technology to manage smaller accounts more efficiently, which could bring more investors into the advice realm.

                                            The Economics of Populism
                                        


In a clear signal from voters who feel left behind by globalization, populist political parties have been gaining ground around the world. This could create serious long-term headwinds for economies and markets, including lower growth and higher inflation.

Moon Jae-in was elected to office thanks to an ambitious reform agenda that clearly resonated with voters. But first he must wrestle with his predecessor’s legacy of corruption, new threats from the north and a strong opposition party.

5 Reasons to Expect Higher Oil Prices

Despite a recent bout with plunging prices, we believe the oil market should grind higher thanks to solid global demand, renewed supply constraints and still-significant underinvestment. This builds a clear case for investing in the energy sector, both for income and for capital return.

The Retirement Calculator is not intended to forecast or estimate the current or future actual investment classes or assets of your portfolio (or any specific asset allocation), or the actual statistical income value. In addition, the Retirement Calculator shall not be used as the key basis of any investment or tax planning decision. The Retirement Calculator does not make any tax assumptions and all analytical results are stated in gross value (pre-tax).

What our customers say ...








                                    I used your Indian network to make contact with a broad range of potential investors from small angels to larger investment groups from several countries. Consequently, I was able to make serious headway in raising the funds I needed for my startup Sure Taxis. It was one of the best investments I made for my startup.

                                    I have spent thousands on Angel Investor introductions agents such as yourselves yet none of them have been anywhere near as good and understanding and helpful and so on as what you guys have (even when I have paid thousands of dollars for other services).                                







Philip Sukkar

                                    I have raised over £120,000 from the Angel Investment Network (and some investors are still coming in). Their system is easy to use, the website is superb and I highly recommend that other entrepreneurs use this funding approach.
