Welcome to the Dr. Gregory Fichter dental practice website.  My office is located in one of the historic Seagram Lofts condominium buildings on Father David Bauer Drive in Uptown Waterloo, Ontario. The office design is unique in that the developers used materials from the original building in the units.  I have been in this location for over ten years and prior to this the dental office was located in Westmount Place Mall for ten years.My treatment services include all types of dental restorations including fillings, crowns, bridges, implant restorations, and removable dentures, with an emphasis on white coloured filling materials.  The dental practice has a hygiene department and other services we provide include tooth whitening procedures, night guards, sports mouth guards and digital radiography.I treat patients of all ages and the office is wheelchair accessible.  We welcome new and emergency patients.
