Mr. Gozon's service on Triumph's Board since the Company's inception as a separate company provides him with a deep familiarity with the Company's business and industry. His own extensive experience as a senior executive in public companies has included broad management responsibility, including supervisory responsibility for the preparation of complex public company financial statements. These management experiences enable Mr. Gozon to contribute substantially to the oversight of all aspects of Triumph's operations, including service as the Company's lead independent director until April 2015.
