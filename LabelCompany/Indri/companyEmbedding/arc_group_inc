					"ARC Irrigation was involved from the construction stage of building our house. They installed a termagation system throughout the foundations of the house, 15 years later no sign of a termite. They also installed a pressure system and storage tanks for the house and later installed a water softening device to stop the calcium build up. ARC Irrigation also installed an irrigation system with pop up sprinklers and drip irrigation. I have a service contract with them and any issues with system are dealt with quickly. Excellent service."
