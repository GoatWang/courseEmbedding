Lafayette offers investment advisory services to individuals with assets that are significant in size and complexity. We help clients reach long-term financial goals involving:

Investment portfolios
										Retirement expectations and provisions
										Inheritances
										Educational funds for children or grandchildren
										Tax considerations
										Other asset allocation decisions
									
Our attention to the business of investment gives our clients freedom to focus on life, not finances.
Individualized Accounts
No two clients are alike in their requirements, so accounts are individualized and customized. Each account is separately managed and constantly monitored to define and re-define individual needs. Assets are allocated among stocks, bonds and money market instruments based on clients requirements. Along with direct consultations, we provide regular quarterly reports, interim reports as needed and annual tax summaries.
Fee Structure
Our fee structure is based on a percentage of assets under 
                management. The standard fee is 1% per year on the first $1 million 
                with reduced fees for assets above $1 million. We prefer that 
                clients have at least $1 million in investable assets.




















Focus on long-term asset growth, not just the next quarters earnings





Flexible investment stylewe will look at companies of any size





In depth understanding of fixed income markets

LAFAYETTE INVESTMENTS, INC.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY DISCLOSURE SUMMARY
FINRA Rule 4370 requires Lafayette Investments, Inc. (“Lafayette” or “the Firm”) and introducing firms like it to create and maintain Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) and emergency contact information that are designed to enable the Firm to continue to meet its obligations to customers in the event of a significant business disruption. Lafayette provides this BCP Summary to customers upon account opening, and provides notice to all customers that it is available upon request by means of an annual statement notice.  Lafayette’s website provides a link to the Firm’s Summary BCP.  Lafayette will also provide a written summary of the BCP of its clearing firm, First Clearing, upon request.
Lafayette’s BCP sets forth procedures that the Firm will follow in case of a significant business disruption. Lafayette will review and update the BCP as required by FINRA Rules, and as dictated by important changes to the Firm’s operations.  Lafayette will at a minimum conduct an annual review of its BCP and revise it as required by changes to the Firm’s business operations.
The following are the key elements of Lafayette’s BCP:
Data back-up and recovery;
                All mission critical systems;
                Financial and operational assessments;
                Alternate communications between customers and Lafayette;
                Alternate communications between Lafayette and its employees;
                Alternate physical location of employees;
                Critical business constituent, bank and counter-party impact;
                Regulatory reporting;
                Communications with regulators; and
                How Lafayette will assure customers’ prompt access to their funds and securities in the event that Lafayette determines that it is unable to continue its business.
Lafayette has considered and made plans for disruptions that affect either of its two office locations, the particular cities in which these offices are located and disruptions that affect widespread areas of the region and of the continental United States, including the operations of its clearing firm, First Clearing, with main offices located in St. Louis, Missouri and Richmond, Virginia.
In case of a disruption to the particular building or particular city location of either of Lafayette’s offices, employees of one office could be relocated to the other office in order to continue to provide full service to customers and communication with regulators.  Key employees from each office have secure remote access to every capability currently available on their office computers.  
Lafayette’s two offices are located about 15 miles apart in suburban Maryland.  As long as one location or the other maintains contact with First Clearing  and has access to computer facilities, there should be no significant business disruption as a result of a temporary inability to use either office facility.  In case both of Lafayette’s locations become uninhabitable in an emergency, employees with remote access can step in to provide essential services from the remote location of their choice. 
Lafayette relies upon its clearing firm, First Clearing, to provide mission critical systems that enable the Firm to process securities transactions promptly and accurately and to permit it to maintain customer accounts and give customers access to their funds and securities.  First Clearing’s own BCP states that First Clearing has established alternate site facilities. Alternate trading locations have un-interruptible power sources, 24-hour security service and fully functional trading areas available around the clock.  First Clearing has provided Lafayette with alternate contact methods to be used in case of a business disruption, and key Lafayette employees have access to these methods both at work and at home.  Lafayette has established and tested a contact list with employees’ home and cell phone numbers and personal email accounts for use during a business disruption.  Depending upon the type of business disruption that occurs, Lafayette can remain in contact with its employees and communicate alternate operational arrangements.
First Clearing’s BCP has established disaster recovery plans for a widespread disruption that rely on the use of alternate sites and data centers located outside of the St. Louis, MO and Richmond, VA areas.  First Clearing expects to restore time-sensitive functions at alternate facilities as soon as employees can be relocated there.  First Clearing  may have access to some facilities of Wells Fargo for use in case of citywide or regional business disruptions.  In addition, First Clearing has developed alternate service arrangements and contingency plans with its internal and external service providers sufficient to provide it, and Lafayette, with the necessary applications to continue or promptly resume business.
It is Lafayette’s intention to continue essential operations and resume normal operations as soon as possible in any of the scenarios outlined above.  In keeping with regulatory requirements, the names and contact information of two Lafayette senior management contacts are on file with FINRA, and are updated promptly when any material contact information changes occur.  Lafayette’s emergency contact information on file is verified periodically as required by FINRA Rule 4517.  
 
SIPC PROTECTION DISCLOSURE
Securities and cash in client accounts have two sources of protection.  Both Lafayette and First Clearing are members of Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).  SIPC protects the clients of its member firms against the loss of their cash and securities in the event of the member’s insolvency and liquidation.  
SIPC coverage is limited to $500,000 per customer (including $250,000 for claims for cash). For more information on SIPC coverage, please see the brochure at www.sipc.org or contact SIPC at (202) 371-8300.
In addition, First Clearing maintains a program of additional protection. The additional insurance coverage is provided through Lexington Insurance Company (“Lexington”). For clients who have received the full SIPC payout limit, First Clearing’s policy with Lexington provides additional coverage above the SIPC limits for any missing securities and cash in client investment accounts up to a First Clearing aggregate limit of $1 billion (including up to $1.9 million for cash per client). SIPC and the additional protection do not insure the quality of investments or protect against losses from fluctuating market value. Not all investments are protected by SIPC. Please refer to the Account Protection section of your statement for SIPC coverage limitations in accounts carried by First Clearing. Monies held in the Bank Deposit Sweep are not covered by SIPC, but are instead covered by FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.
