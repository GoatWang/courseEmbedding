PRESS RELEASE
Energy industry veteran Victor Burk has joined Alvarez & Marsal, one of the leading independent professional services firms specializing in performance improvement, turnaround management and business advisory services, as a managing director. Based in Houston, Mr. Burk is responsible for expanding the firm’s full complement of services to the energy sector.  





Mr. Burk has provided professional services to companies in the energy industry for 37 years. Prior to joining A&M, he was the leader of the energy practice for Spencer Stuart, one of the premier global executive search firms. Previous to Spencer Stuart, he was in public accounting for 33 years, serving as the leader of the global oil and gas practices for Deloitte & Touche and Arthur Andersen. 
 
“Victor has extensive experience in many aspects of the energy industry. His deep knowledge of the complex problems facing the energy industry in today’s environment will allow A&M to bring our clients better solutions integrating our broad capabilities in restructuring, consulting and tax,” said Tom Elsenbrook, a managing director and head of A&M Business Consulting. 
“Most companies in the energy industry have been adversely affected by the dramatic decline in oil and natural gas prices,” said Dean Swick, a managing director in the turnaround and restructuring group of A&M in Houston. “We are delighted to have Victor join and to add his insight and firsthand knowledge of the energy sector, as we expand our interdisciplinary service offerings to companies in this space.”  





 
Over the course of his career, Mr. Burk has participated in hundreds of financial statement audit, consulting, advisory and executive search assignments for a variety of U.S. and international energy companies, including major international oil companies, national oil companies, independent E&P companies, refiners, renewable energy companies, as well as companies that provide capital and services to the energy industry. 
 
Mr. Burk is a current board member of EV Management, L.P., the Houston Producers’ Forum and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (Southeast Texas Region). He was a member of the National Petroleum Council from 2000 until 2006. 
 
Mr. Burk holds a B.B.A. degree in accounting from Stephen F. Austin State University.
