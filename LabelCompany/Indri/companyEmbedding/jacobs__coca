About Jacobs
                








It’s about trusted relationships.






                        At Jacobs, our focus on building long-term client relationships has helped us become one of the largest and most diverse providers of technical, professional and construction services, including all aspects of architecture, engineering and construction, operations and maintenance, as well as scientific and specialty consulting. Our 54,000 employees in  230+ locations around the world serve a broad range of companies and organizations, including industrial, commercial, and government clients across multiple markets and geographies. 
                    

                        More than 95 percent of our work is repeat business. We get to know our customers’ businesses intimately, and partner with them to help them achieve their objectives. That commitment to our clients produces consistent cost advantages, profits and growth, allowing us to attract and retain the industry's top talent. Our strict dedication to safety and uncompromising ethics create a work environment that promotes employee progress and helps generate nearly $11 billion in annual revenue. 
                    

                        We measure the value we bring to clients every day — wherever in the world they may be, in any industry or technical discipline. In fact in 2016 we produced $7.79 billion in client savings through our JacobsValue program, a major accomplishment.

Safety








Take safety everywhere you go.






                        For Jacobs, safety is more than a policy manual or a training video; it’s how we do business and it’s how we live 24/7. Jacobs invites you to experience our culture of caring – a culture in which safety, health and welfare are top priorities; and in which we’re all responsible for looking out for one another.
                    

                        Jacobs' safety culture extends outside the office walls, beyond the project site and into our cars, our homes, and our communities; affecting all the people we interact with everywhere around the world. BeyondZero® is the name of our safety program, and it’s about every one of us making safety a personal value that we live by each day.

Safety Week 2017
Kate's Story: A safety video
BeyondZero: Home. Work. You.











Being safe every day on every job site crosses competitive boundaries. Jacobs is proud to sponsor Safety Week, an initiative of more than 40 national and global construction firms that have joined forces with a single aim: to inspire everyone in the industry to be leaders in safety. 
During Safety Week, May 1-5, 2017, Jacobs employees worldwide will kick off our celebration of the 10th anniversary of our BeyondZero® culture of caring. We’ll hold workshops, contests, and even dance performances. Offices and jobsites will learn about our daily topics:

BeyondZero’s 10th Anniversary
Make Safety a Constant
Positive Mental Health
Emergency Preparedness
Local Choice

We hope that whether you’re an employee or prospective employee, a client, subcontractor, competitor, or just an interested member of the public, you’ll join us in participating in Safety Week.

Thank you for helping to celebrate safety!



“Kate’s Story” tells the tragic story of Jacobs employee Kate Carpenter (London, UK), whose husband, John Kinns, also an employee, lost his life as the result of injuries sustained in the field.
Produced internally by Jacobs, the video has been shown and discussed at office meetings around the globe and has had a profound impact within the company. The video is now available for employees to view and share with family, friends, business partners, and clients.
Please take Kate’s message to heart.


 ®
BeyondZero© is Jacobs' safety program.We provide a variety of useful safety tools and training to all Jacobs employees, covering topics that are applicable at work, at home, and everywhere they go. Jacobs is always working to identify critical risks that cause injuries, illnesses, and incidents. Then we take proactive steps to eliminate them by helping our people develop safer behaviors, and by encouraging them to inspire others to do the same.










 



Ethics and integrity
                








Ethics and integrity are our foundation.





Over decades of consistent behavior guided by our core values, Jacobs has earned a reputation as an ethical company. We make decisions with fairness and honesty, holding ourselves and our colleagues accountable for high standards of conduct on each job we do throughout the world.
Our Board of Directors, CEO, and Senior Financial Officers take ethics and integrity very seriously. Our company is built upon a deep commitment to ethical behavior and as such our leadership at the highest levels are governed by a code of conduct.  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Jacobs Board of Directors and our Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers demonstrates our pledge to run our company with integrity.
Jacobs' Code of Conduct is a useful guide for all our employees worldwide that outlines our collective commitment to our values and beliefs, and helps us exercise ethical decision making and good judgment – even in difficult situations.
Jacobs also expects the companies we partner with to operate with a high level of integrity, and our corresponding Supplier Code of Conduct is applicable to those in our supply chain. We also encourage our employees and suppliers to ask questions when in doubt and report violations, which they can do via an email address or our Integrity Hotline (1.877.522.6272). 
Most recently and for the second time since 2010, Jacobs has been named one of America’s Most Trustworthy Companies by Forbes Magazine. In the large-cap category, Jacobs is one of only 14 firms featured and the only engineering and construction company featured in the large cap category. Read more on Forbes.







                        “Every day we strive to act with integrity and honesty to ensure the health and future of our company. We ask that each of our Jacobs teammates, clients and partners commit to maintaining the highest ethical standards.” — Steve Demetriou, Chairman and CEO

Inclusion
                








Inclusion means welcoming all backgrounds, experiences and ideas.





At Jacobs, we value inclusion and diversity because it energizes our people and encourages creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Learning about new and different perspectives and experiences creates more varied thinking. Considering several unique points of view often results in better decisions and solutions for our clients, our investors, and ultimately our company.
The term “inclusive” can refer to many things; but as it applies to Jacobs, it means welcoming and respecting the varied backgrounds, talents, skills, and experiences of all our employees and everyone we do business with around the world – embracing and appreciating both our similarities and our differences. Inclusion is woven throughout our culture of caring; enabling us to be an engaged, committed, and productive company that produces positive results for our clients and their stakeholders. Come work for us - we want you on our team!

Global network
                








We’re global. And we’re local.





Our delivery philosophy is simple: Jacobs is located around the world where our clients are today and where they need us to be tomorrow. Their needs help drive our business, so we expand our offerings, locations, and staff to best serve them when and where they need us.
The result is a global network of local offices that share common values and a commitment to customized service. Jacobs employees from our 230+ locations communicate seamlessly across geographic and disciplinary areas on a daily basis to collaborate, share innovative ideas and best practices, and help clients find the best solutions for every project. We do this through regular use of our internal social communication tools and through a variety of facilitated networking events and functions that create a boundaryless, supportive and productive atmosphere within the company.
With nearly 54,000 talented, dedicated employees, Jacobs' diverse and international workforce gives clients an established local presence that understands their businesses, helping to reduce risk and maximize value. Because everyone at Jacobs is guided by the same core values and operates according to the same Code of Conduct, we behave and perform consistently no matter where we are; one company around the globe.

Our history
                








Our rich history fuels the future.





Our history begins with the company's founding by Joseph J. Jacobs in 1947. Since then, we have gradually evolved from a one-man engineering consultant to the publicly traded Fortune 500 company we are today. 
About two-thirds of Jacobs' consistent growth comes from organic expansion as we serve the changing and growing needs of our customers. Because we partner with our clients and truly understand their business objectives, we work in the locations and industries where they need us to be; and we position ourselves to serve their needs effectively.
Another way Jacobs is able to continuously improve and grow is through acquisition. We have acquired more than 70 businesses, and each one has contributed to our reach and capabilities. Together, as Jacobs, we deliver the benefits of a fully integrated global organization.
Our rich history guides our growth, and the possibilities are limitless in terms of the company we are yet to become. But a few simple things remain constant throughout times of change: our firm commitment to our relationship based business model; and our focus on safety, quality, and ethics are foundational to who we are.

Architecture & interiors
                








The right balance in architecture and interior design.





Architecture and interior design is the combination of our clients’ needs and values, art and technology, community and place – all coming together creatively to build environments that enrich people’s lives and elevate the human spirit.  
To do this, Jacobs focuses on promoting architectural design excellence rather than a signature style, because our design response for each project arises out of the specifics of its site, program, and physical and cultural context. 
Our approach is thoughtful and collaborative; each design and construction stakeholder plays an important role in helping us derive the right the solution to delight our clients. 
In designing interiors Jacobs aims to inspire and reflect our clients’ identities. We familiarize ourselves with their needs, histories, brand identities, work styles, and management philosophies to balance artistic expression with functional, pragmatic considerations. 
Jacobs integrates all of our services to create facilities that meet clients' needs both now and in the future. We put all our talents, ideas and experiences toward striking the right balance between achieving unequaled building solutions and meeting our clients’ business needs, goals, and ultimate visions.

Jacobs is one of the largest construction companies in the world.
As a full service, fully integrated firm, Jacobs designs, engineers, and constructs our clients’ projects from beginning to end with our own expert and caring hands.

That way, our construction plan is the context within which we design and procure; resulting in reduced schedule and costs.
Jacobs has experience meeting aggressive and complex schedules, and we offer a number of alternative delivery processes for public works and civil infrastructure projects.
In everything we build for our clients around the world, safety is our number one priority.

We are a leading IT partner with the defense industry and armed services, including aircraft and weapons system research and testing, software development, data management, and defense program IT support.
We bring a unique advantage to our clients. Jacobs has partner agreements with top-tier IT companies, resellers and distributors.  With direct access to industry leaders, we are made aware of emerging technologies to provide the latest solutions to IT challenges.  Direct reseller agreements with our vendor partners enable us to offer extremely competitive pricing on hardware and software, as well as take advantage of their expertise in system design and implementation.

By taking responsibility for the effective and successful delivery of the IT system over the contract period, we allow our customers to focus on their core business.

Jacobs Connected Enterprise
