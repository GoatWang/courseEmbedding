Global Equity


The Global Equity strategy predominantly focuses on high-quality businesses domiciled in developed countries around the world and allows for a limited allocation (typically less than 10%) to emerging markets. Securities have a minimum market capitalization of $2 billion at initial investment. The portfolio represents a diversified set of high-conviction holdings (typically 40–55) that we believe are trading at a discount to fair value and possess catalysts to unlock that value within our three- to five-year investment horizon. The strategy invests in common stocks, both American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and Ordinary Shares (ORDs).
The objective of the strategy is to optimize long-term performance versus the MSCI World Index with a focus on mitigating risk over a multi-year time period.

Investment Criteria


Aristotle Capital’s experienced investment team spends the majority of its time studying businesses. We employ a bottom-up, fundamental approach to security selection that requires in-depth research of individual companies and their competitors, suppliers and customers. We concentrate on the factors within management’s control rather than macroeconomic factors, economic cycles or market sentiment.
Our disciplined investment process focuses on identification of the following investment criteria, all three of which are required for investment in any of our portfolios:

High or improving quality—aids in managing downside risk
Attractive valuation—provides a margin of safety
Business-specific catalysts—help us to avoid the “value trap,” which occurs when cheap companies continue to get cheaper

Aristotle Capital Management, LLC : Top Money Managers  




Aristotle Capital Management, LLC | 2014 Annual Letter











TO OUR CLIENTS:
I am pleased to report that Aristotle Capital Management, LLC had a steady year of growth as we took further steps to enhance the capabilities of our organization to better serve our clients while adhering to our core beliefs.  We expanded our investment platform, broadened our distribution channels and hired key talent across all departments to support our growth.  At year-end 2014, Aristotle Capital and its affiliated companies had a total of $12 billion in assets under management and 84 professionals located in its Los Angeles, Newport Beach and Boston offices.    
2014 YEAR IN REVIEW
While Aristotle Capital showed solid organic growth last year across all of its existing investment strategies, we also had the opportunity to add two new talented investment teams to the Aristotle family.   

We started 2014 announcing our affiliation with Aristotle Credit Partners, LLC, a partnership that enhances our fixed income product offerings with value-oriented credit strategies such as High Yield Bonds, Banks Loans and Investment Grade Corporate Bonds.  We capped off the year by expanding our equity platform through the acquisition of the Small Cap Equity and Small / Mid Cap Equity strategies from Eagle Boston Investment Management to form Aristotle Capital Boston, LLC (Aristotle Boston). 

Furthermore, our International Equity investment strategy achieved a key milestone, completing its seventh year, having outperformed its benchmark, the MSCI EAFE Index, by more than 5% on an annualized gross basis through year-end 2014. In addition, we introduced a new fund into the mutual fund marketplace. Please contact us for more information.      

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
Aristotle Capital offers a wide range of investment solutions, including (U.S.) Value Equity, International Equity, Global Equity and Global Opportunities. Our investment philosophy is rooted in a fundamental, bottom-up process with the goal of preserving capital and generating asset growth for our clients over the long term. 
Our investment teams continually seek to identify what we think are high-quality companies in which we have a well-founded differentiated view of the business and its earnings power.  Our rigorous research process and penchant for challenging conventional wisdom results in our owning a concentrated number of what we believe to be great businesses.
We seek businesses that we expect to thrive in an increasingly global economy and across varying economic cycles.  These businesses often have a global presence, sustainable competitive advantages, high barriers to entry and strong cash flows.  Our team also looks to identify specific catalysts that we believe can drive a company’s stock price higher over time.  

During 2014, some of our new investments included:


ITC Holdings, the largest U.S. independent electricity transmission company, which enjoys an advantaged status from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as it helps to further FERC’s goals of both expanding regional transmission and increasing competition;
Dassault Systèmes, a French-based seller of computer-aided design software tools with strong operating margins and free cash flow;
adidas, the world’s second-largest sporting goods company, which is trading at a significant discount to rivals Nike and Under Armour as it retools its product portfolio; and
Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, which could see stronger earnings power as it repositions its manufacturing and distribution facilities for its snacking brands.

A few of the investments we sold were:

General Mills, the U.S. food maker that we believe paid an excessive price to purchase the organic food company Annie’s Inc.;
Hess Corporation, the oil and gas producer that approached our estimate of intrinsic value following the sale of non-core properties, strengthening its position in the Bakken shale and focusing resources in North America;
Progressive Corp., the automotive insurance provider that raised questions in our minds of achieving the catalysts we had previously identified; and
SunTrust Banks, which successfully executed its cost savings plan and overcame misperceptions regarding credit issues.


EXPANDING THE ARISTOTLE FAMILY AND MOVING EASTWARD
The Aristotle family expanded in 2014 as we selectively added key members and investment strategies to build on the momentum we have developed over the last few years. 
In a significant move just before the year closed, our Chairman Richard S. Hollander expanded our investment platform and geographic presence with the creation of Aristotle Boston, which specializes in providing Small Cap Equity and Small/Mid Cap Equity strategies to our clients.  
Leading Aristotle Boston as co-portfolio managers are Dave Adams, CFA, and Jack McPherson, CFA, who each have more than 24 years of investment experience.  Dave and Jack are joined by four research analysts: Mark Babka, CFA; Todd Grady; Jeffrey Smith, CFA; and James Healy.  The Aristotle Boston team joined us from Eagle Boston Investment Management and is based in Boston.
At the beginning of 2014, we bolstered the Aristotle Capital bench of investment professionals with the additions of Gregory Padilla, CFA, and Alberto Jimenez Crespo, CFA. They joined us having previously worked at Tradewinds Global Investors, a subsidiary of Nuveen Investments.
We also created a new role to complement our equity research.  Dr. Lauren Caston joined as Director of Structured Research and will apply big data analysis techniques to fundamental trends that impact the businesses in which we invest.  Lauren had previously served as Chief Mathematician at Praedicat, which provides consulting services and software to the insurance industry.
Ranjit Sufi joined us in 2014 as Managing Director, Institutional Sales and Marketing, bringing his unique perspective of having worked in executive management roles for both a plan sponsor and an investment manager.  Ranjit and his team are an important bridge between our clients and our investment research professionals as we expand our investment product platform and grow our presence with institutional clients.
Additionally, Matt Schleichkorn, CIMA, joined as Managing Director, Head of Retail Distribution, a newly created position at the firm as we seek to grow our presence in the retail channel.  As part of that effort, Matt assembled a team of six sales professionals. 
We believe our investment approach and culture as an independent, employee-owned firm make Aristotle an attractive destination for talented investment professionals.  In anticipation of further growth, last fall we expanded and moved our Orange County office to Newport Beach from Irvine.  We are delighted to welcome all of our new colleagues and look forward to continuing to serve our clients in 2015.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE—The whole is greater than the sum of its parts
 You may have noticed that we changed our corporate logo.  It was a change that we think encapsulates our global mindset, our multi-faceted nature and creative investment approach.  It further reflects our current evolution and anticipated growth in the years ahead, as we concur with the words of the philosopher Aristotle, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”   
In addition, we hope you have had the chance to visit our publications page and our newly launched YouTube channel, where we showcase our thoughts and bring our investment teams and processes closer to our existing clients, intermediaries and prospective new relationships.  
We believe the steps we took to solidify our organization in 2014—including bringing on additional investment professionals, revising and enhancing our client reports, and producing short videos that offer valuable insights into our talented team and disciplined investment process—are aligned with our commitment of providing clients with high-quality service and value-added investment management. 
We are further committed to serving our communities through time devoted to organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, the Blind Childrens Center in Los Angeles and Operation Gratitude as well as by helping to support business education programs at University of California–Irvine, California State University–Northridge and Chapman University.   
In closing, we want to reiterate our pledge to commit to excellence, act with integrity, execute with discipline and invest with patience.  We also want to thank our clients for their continued confidence and trust, our chairman Richard S. Hollander for his vision and guidance as we build this platform, and our employees who uphold our commitment to clients every day.

Sincerely,

Gary Lisenbee
Co-CEO and Co-Chief Investment Officer

Aristotle Capital Management, LLC Announces Launch Of Its First Mutual Fund






Business Wire




Apr 2, 2012 11:47 AM EDT













 


























































  Aristotle Capital Management, LLC (“Aristotle”), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 on behalf of institutional and high net-worth clients, today announced the introduction of the Aristotle/Saul Opportunity Fund, its first open-ended mutual fund. The objective of the Fund is to seek to maximize long term capital appreciation and income from investments in stocks and other securities, including foreign securities, regardless of market direction. At its “core,” the Fund strives to be a global “unconstrained” strategy. The institutional, no-load share class will trade under the symbol ARSOX.  The Fund employs its actively managed, “go-anywhere” strategy with a fundamental, bottom-up approach to security selection. It focuses on high quality, structurally good businesses with sustainable competitive advantages that are believed to be trading at significant discounts to Aristotle’s estimate of fair value. The Fund utilizes a strategic approach to enhancing Alpha and managing risk and is believed to also be positioned with sufficient flexibility to take advantage of perceived market dislocations as they may arise, including sector/stock overvaluation, fixed income/equity pricing differentials, and possibly specific security/indices and/or exchange traded funds disparities.  The Fund is managed by industry veteran Howard Gleicher, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Aristotle. Commencing in July 2006, Mr. Gleicher served as the sole manager of a private fund with substantially the same investment objective and strategy as the Fund, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at Metropolitan West Capital Management, LLC (“MetWest Capital”). Mr. Gleicher was the strategist for MetWest Capital’s Large Cap Intrinsic Value, International Value, and Global Intrinsic Equity strategies. He also served as a senior analyst with MetWest Capital’s investment team. Mr. Gleicher departed MetWest Capital in October 2010 and continued to manage the private fund at Aristotle, commencing in November 2010. Prior to co-founding MetWest Capital, Mr. Gleicher served as principal, portfolio manager and Investment Policy Committee member with Palley-Needelman Asset Management, Inc. and as vice president and equity portfolio manager with Pacific Investment Management Company. Mr. Gleicher holds Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, and an MBA from Harvard Business School and is a Chartered Financial Analyst.  “The origin of the Aristotle/Saul Opportunity Fund investment process stems from a gift many years ago from my grandfather, Saul Schechter, a successful real estate investor and entrepreneur, to his grandchildren. His intent was to see that the gift was managed in a manner that would provide for the recipients and their families for many generations to come, with no limitations as to how that portfolio was to be invested. We hope to maintain that spirit and purpose of creating a Fund that stands the test of time,” stated Howard Gleicher.  “We are pleased to offer the Aristotle/Saul Opportunity Fund to the open-ended mutual fund marketplace. This 'strategy' previously was only available in the private partnership arena. We feel the timing is excellent for such a product given the rapidly and ever-changing economic conditions across the globe,” commented Steve Borowski, President of Aristotle.   About Aristotle Capital Management, LLC   Aristotle Capital Management, LLC ("Aristotle") is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The firm employs a fundamental, bottom-up research process to drive investments, and offers a selection of U.S. and International equity investment solutions to institutional and high net-worth clients. Visit  www.aristotlecap.com .    An investment in the Fund is subject to risks and you could lose money on your investment in the Fund.     The principal risks of investing in the Fund include, but are not limited to, investing in foreign securities, emerging markets, short sales, derivatives, below investment grade bonds, convertible securities, and ETFs.      Foreign securities have additional risks including currency rate changes, political and economic instability, lack of comprehensive company information, less market liquidity, less efficient trading markets, and differing auditing controls and legal standards. Investments in emerging markets involve even greater risks.     The use of short sales and ETFs may cause the fund to have higher expenses than those of other equity funds. Short sales are speculative transactions and involve special risks, including a greater reliance on the investment team's ability to accurately anticipate the future value of a security. The Fund's losses are potentially unlimited in a short sale transaction. The Fund's use of short sales and futures contracts leverages the Fund's portfolio. The Fund's use of leverage can make the Fund more volatile and magnify the effect of any losses. There is no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful.     The Fund may invest in derivatives which can be highly volatile, illiquid, difficult to value, and changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate with the underlying securities or other securities held directly by the Fund.     Such risks include gains or losses which, as a result of leverage, can be substantially greater than the derivatives' original cost. There is also a possibility that derivatives may not perform as intended which can reduce opportunity for gain or result in losses by offsetting positive returns in other securities the Fund owns.     Alpha is a measure of the portfolio’s risk adjusted performance. When compared to the portfolio’s beta, a positive alpha indicates better-than-expected portfolio performance and a negative alpha worse-than-expected portfolio performance.    Please consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus or summary prospectus that contains this and other information about the Fund is available by calling 1.866.661.6691 or visit aristotlefunds.com and should be read carefully prior to investing.   The Aristotle/Saul Opportunity Fund is distributed by Grand Distribution Services, LLC, located at 803 West Michigan Street, Milwaukee, WI 53233.

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 8, 2014--Aristotle Capital Management, LLC (“Aristotle Capital”), a value-oriented investment management firm for institutional and high net worth clients with $7.2 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2014, today announced that Matt Schleichkorn has joined the company as Managing Director, Retail Sales and Marketing, a newly created position at the firm.

Schleichkorn will spearhead Aristotle Capital’s expansion into the retail investor marketplace, creating a team that will open new channels for the firm to offer its full array of equity products as well as fixed income products through its affiliate firm, Aristotle Credit Partners, LLC (“Aristotle Credit”). He will be based at Aristotle Capital’s Los Angeles headquarters.
“Aristotle is taking the next step in its evolution by further expanding into the retail channel, building on the firm’s growing asset base in the institutional investor community,” said Gary Lisenbee, Aristotle’s Co-CEO and Co-Chief Investment Officer. “We are fortunate to have an individual of Matt’s caliber to lead this new effort. He is a leader with extensive experience directing retail sales teams at large financial organizations.”
“Increasing our presence in the retail channel is another example of how we intend to offer a full suite of services to investors across all of our investment platforms,” said Richard S. Hollander, Chairman of Aristotle, and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MetWest Ventures, which is the architect behind the formation of Aristotle Capital and Aristotle Credit as well as an advisor and partner to both firms. “We are delighted that Matt has chosen to take this step with us.”
Prior to joining Aristotle Capital, Schleichkorn spent more than six years at Merrill Lynch as Director, Managed Solutions for the West Coast. Before that, he was a Senior Vice President at Phoenix Investment Partners, selling mutual funds and separately managed accounts to the financial advisor community. He also worked nine years at Morgan Stanley, where his roles included National Sales Manager of their Consulting Service Group and Financial Advisor.
“I am honored to be chosen by Richard and Gary to drive this effort at Aristotle,” said Schleichkorn. “The investment management team has an experienced background and the firm’s employee-owned culture makes it an attractive place to assemble this new sales team. The opportunity to build a direct retail business at a private investment firm is very appealing to me. We believe Aristotle has excellent investment products, so it is my intention to make Aristotle a go-to name among retail brokers, registered investment advisors and consumers.”
Schleichkorn earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Pepperdine University and a Bachelor of Art degree in Business Administration from the University of Southern California. He holds a number of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) licenses, including the Series 7, 63 and 65. He also earned the Certified Investment Management Analyst (CIMA) designation from the Investment Management Consultants Association (IMCA), an organization in which Schleichkorn helps to chair certain events. He and his family are active participants with Operation Gratitude, an organization that honors active military members.
