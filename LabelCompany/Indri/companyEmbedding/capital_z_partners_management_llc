Themes

Due to its large size, considerable diversification and complexity, the financial services sector regularly generates a number of predictable trends and dynamics that give rise to capital needs and attractive investment opportunities.
Capital Deficiencies
Due to the nature and complexity of the products, pricing models and balance sheets of companies within the financial services industry, as well as market events such as natural catastrophes and credit crises, companies or entire sub-sectors within the financial services industry may experience capital deficiencies.
Consolidation Opportunities

Most sub-sectors of the financial services industry remain highly fragmented, which creates opportunities for strategic acquisition financing and for “roll-up” strategies. Deep industry experience is required to identify these trends proactively and to source and structure investment opportunities.
Strategic Shifts by Larger Companies
Many larger financial services companies have undergone alternating periods of expansion through acquisitions followed by contraction through divestitures aimed at refocusing operations on core business lines.
Cyclicality and Market Dislocation
The cyclicality of many sub-sectors of the financial services industry offers investment opportunities arising from market dislocation. During their emergence from cyclical troughs, existing strategic competitors often lack the resources or focus to deploy capital in the early stage of a sub-sector’s recovery.
Niche Growth Opportunities
The large size and fragmentation of many sub-sectors of the financial services industry offer the opportunity for smaller franchises operating in niche markets or possessing unique distribution or product capabilities to gain market share. Specialist companies have often emerged in these niche markets.
Complex Ownership Conversions
Many companies in the financial services industry possess complicated and evolving ownership structures. The insurance and banking industries include many companies that are owned by their policyholders or deposit holders, respectively. Many of these mutual companies continue to seek conversion to stock ownership, driven by the need to access the capital markets and provide equity-linked management incentives.

Daily Racing Form Purchased By Z Capital Partners



Sponsored by:
 


by Edited Press Release | 07.26.2017 | 8:17am 







 
 






Private equity management company Z Capital Partners has purchased Sports Information Group, the parent company of Daily Racing Form.
The purchase was announced in a July 25 press release from Z Capital Partners, the private equity management arm of Z Capital Group, which describes itself as “a leading global alternative investment manager focused on opportunistic, value-oriented private equity and credit funds” with $2.3 billion of regulatory assets under management.
“The big opportunity for us is to digitize the print side of the business, which the former owners started to do—it's expensive and there is still a way to go to make it fully function, and then the online gaming offering,” said Z Capital Group CEO James Zenni in an interview with Bloomberg's Jason Kelly on Bloomberg Markets. Zenni said his company started watching Daily Racing Form about four years ago.
The release said terms of the deal would not be disclosed.
“We are thrilled to join the Z Capital family,” said SIG chairman and CEO John Hartig. “Z Capital's financial strength, experience, insight, and operational expertise will help Daily Racing Form and the company's other platforms continue to enhance and expand our digital offerings and better serve our loyal readers and customers, while staying true to the publication's rich history and its market-leading brand.”

Daily Racing Form was advised in the transaction by JEGI I Clarity.
Daily Racing Form has covered horse racing since 1894, publishes up to 2,000 unique pages of statistical and editorial copy every day, in as many as 20 daily editions, 364 days a year, and includes a companion website that provides news coverage, race results, exclusive handicapping tools, as well as sales and auction coverage through DRF Breeding, and access to the account deposit wagering site DRF Bets.
In February Z Capital Partners completed a purchase of Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in a deal that valued the casino owner at $580 million. At the time Affinity Gaming owned 11 casinos, including five in Nevada.

God please bring back the Newspaper Racing Form, I might actaully buy one again if they do! One can always hope!






longshot



I was going to write the same comment, you beat me to it. And start putting the race charts back in.






Andrew Mollica



Wow do i agree with that!! Pleae bring the charts back it was why I purchased the damn paper inthe first place! The level of stupidity in hte marketing and publishing of this once brilliant paper shocks the conscionce and how about a dauil;y column and around the ovals! Joe Hirsch where are you! Rest his soul!










adavids



I use to like the big fat simulcast book..they stopped selling that on about 10 years ago. .I think if they sold individual programs for $2 each..would make more sense. .I only bet 1 or 2 tracks a day..I don’t need 12 tracks jammed into a small progam






kcbca1



I had a problem with a product I purchased from them and was overcharged. After roughly 10 calls to get the proper credit refunded I gave up and just placed a stop payment on my CC. It’s not like I did not warn them. I guess the call center is in Indiana not that it matters.






greg



GREAT, the Form has gotten so cheap that to read anything requires a subscription, hopefully they’ll get rid of some very dead weight, “handicappers” who only pick 5/2 shots and under i.e. Brad Free, and can generate better articles (Sorry ray)






Mike Oliveto



I’m hoping the new ownership cleans house and brings in a tech capable staff that understands the need for a usable online presence and a high level of customer service.  The current website is quite possibly the worst destination I’ve seen that’s not some kid’s middle school project.

Private equity firms: God’s proof that the wealthy do not need any more tax breaks






CE Butler



The “FORM” is an expensive mess and has been for years.  The price is up to $10.00 on track $12.00 off track.  Next time you’re at the track take a look around and very few people have the Form.  I’d say the average age of a reader is 65 w/most younger people opting to buy the track program.
They have out priced themselves and I don’t see this new group doing much to change that.  The “FORM” sadly like racing is dead; it just hasn’t fallen down yet.






stevemak



This is quite a decline in value (from another article): “Z Capital is buying Daily Racing Form’s parent company, Sports Information Group LLC,
 for less than $100 million, according to a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be named because financial terms were private. Arlington Capital Partners formed Sports Information Group and acquired Daily Racing Form for a reported $200 million in 2007.”

PRESS RELEASE
Capital Z acquires Portfolio Group from Frontenac
Lake Forest, CA – June 2016 – Capital Z Partners Management, LLC (“Capital Z”), a New York-based private equity firm, announced today that it has acquired Portfolio Group, Inc (“Portfolio” or the “Company”) from Frontenac Company, LLC (“Frontenac”), a Chicago-based private equity firm.

The Company develops, sells and administers auto dealer extended warranty programs across a full-service product offering including vehicle service contracts, GAP insurance and ancillary products. Management will retain its current roles in day-to-day operations and retain significant ownership.
 
“We enjoyed strong growth during Frontenac’s ownership as we’ve executed a number of key internal growth initiatives that expanded the Company’s geographic footprint and dealership network, in addition to developing the support functions necessary to facilitate continued expansion” said President and Chief Executive Officer Brent Griggs. “In Capital Z, we have found a future partner who will continue to support our strong growth, knows the insurance markets, and shares our strategic vision.”

The strength of the management team, their vision for the future and unique business model makes Portfolio well positioned to take advantage of current industry trends. Capital Z is pleased to have reached this agreement and we look forward to partnering with management to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities available.”
Ron Kuehl, Managing Director of Frontenac, said, “Partnering with founder-owned businesses is a core pillar of our strategy and we are delighted in the successful partnership we forged with Brent and Portfolio’s founder Steve Burke. We are confident that management and their new partner Capital Z will continue the strong growth trajectory of the Company.”
