NATCHEZ, Miss., May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Callon Petroleum Company (NYSE:    CPE) announced today that the Company's Board of Directors has appointed Joseph Gatto Jr. as Chief Executive Officer and L. Richard Flury as non-executive Chairman, succeeding Fred Callon, former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, following his unexpected death on May 24, 2017. Mr. Gatto will also continue performing his current duties as the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer. The remainder of the Company's leadership team will continue in their present roles. No changes are anticipated in the Company's day-to-day business activities. 








Mr. Gatto worked closely alongside Mr. Callon since 2012 as the Company executed an aggressive growth strategy in the Permian Basin that significantly transformed the Company. Since the beginning of 2016, Callon has completed over $1 billion in acquisitions and $2 billion in debt and equity raises, nearly tripling the Company's acreage position and building a solid financial position for the future. Mr. Gatto is well-known in the oil and gas industry and highly respected by the Company's employees and investors, and his intimate knowledge and extensive experience with the Company makes him uniquely qualified to move the Company forward. 
Mr. Gatto commented, "I am humbled by the opportunity to continue to build upon Fred's legacy and fulfill his vision for Callon Petroleum. I am honored to have been chosen by the Board to continue my strong partnership with Callon's Chief Operating Officer, Gary Newberry as together we lead our experienced management team in the execution of our growth initiatives that we believe will create differentiated value for our shareholders. We are all committed to ensuring a smooth transition and to honoring Fred's memory through a continued commitment to our core values. We will always be profoundly grateful for his friendship and leadership, and he will be deeply missed by our organization as well as the oil and gas industry. During this time, all of our thoughts are with Fred's family and we will do everything we can to support them." 
Prior to joining Callon, Mr. Gatto held various positions in the financial advisory and energy investment banking groups of Merrill Lynch & Co., Barclays Capital, Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. and MarchWire Capital, LLC, which he founded. Mr. Gatto graduated from Cornell University with a BS degree and The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with an MBA.
Mr. Flury has served on the Board since 2004 and currently serves on the Company's Audit, Compensation and Strategic Planning and Reserves Committees. Prior to his retirement, Mr. Flury spent over 30 years with Amoco Corporation, and later, BP p.l.c., most recently as Chief Executive, Gas and Power and Renewables. Mr. Flury is also a director and the non-executive Chairman of Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, N.V.
About Callon Petroleum Company
Callon is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration, and operation of oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin in West Texas.

He went to school in Solothurn, later taught there, conducted its orchestra, and had his operas and ballets performed at the local theatre by its semi-professional ensemble. But Flury was more than just another conservative composer stuck in the provinces. His teachers included Ernst Kurth and Joseph Marx of Vienna, and his music was performed by conductors such as Felix Weingartner and Hermann Scherchen and star instrumentalists like Wilhelm Backhaus and Georg Kulenkampff. His first opera was conducted by a former student of Berg and Schoenberg who became his staunch advocate, and during the Second World War Flury worked closely with several Jewish emigré writers and musicians from Germany and Czechoslovakia. In his music of the early 1930s, the influence of Berg and Hindemith became apparent as Flury dabbled in modernism and free tonality before moving back to a more traditionalist stance; but he was also a fine tunesmith who loved writing Viennese waltzes and violin miniatures after the manner of Kreisler. In both his aesthetic and his career, Flury offers a fascinating case of a man negotiating constantly between the centre and the periphery – and composing some very good music in the process.Chris Walton, born in 1963, studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Zurich and was a Humboldt Research Fellow at Munich University. He was head of Music Division at the Zurich Central Library for ten years, during which time he also lectured at ETH Zurich and worked as an occasional répétiteur, continuo player and conductor. He then spent several years as Professor and Head of Music Department at the University of Pretoria, and today lectures at the Musikhochschule Basel and heads a research project at the Bern University of the Arts. In 2009 he was awarded the Prize of the Max Geilinger Foundation for his contribution to Swiss-British cultural ties. He has published several books on Austro-German music from Wagner to Berg. He lives in Solothurn and Törbel in the Swiss Alps.ReviewsThere are no reviews yet.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
