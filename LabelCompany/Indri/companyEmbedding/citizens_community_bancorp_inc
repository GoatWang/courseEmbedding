Online Banking /Bill Pay/eStatements

Even if you're not eligible for the monthly service fee waiver, you can still try Bill Pay for free for the first three months. After that, Bill Pay is $5 per month. The monthly service fee will be assessed starting in the first month of use after the free trial period. The charge will be deducted from your checking account.
How do I sign up for eStatements?
To sign up for e-statements, you must be enrolled in Online Banking. Contact our Customer Service Center at 800-590-9920 to sign up for online banking.
Once signed into your online banking, click on the Options tab towards the top of your screen. Scroll down to eStatement Enrollment and click on Edit.

Click Enroll to complete your registration.
How do I view my eStatements?

How do I cancel eStatements?
To resume receiving paper statements by mail, stop by your local office to complete an eStatement cancellation form. Please be aware that some accounts are assessed a fee to receive paper statements.
Will my eStatement look the same as a paper statement?
Yes, your eStatement will appear the same as a paper statement.
How much does it cost to receive eStatements?
eStatements are a free service offered by CCFBank.
How will I know when my eStatement is available to view?
You will automatically receive an email at the end of your statement cycle notifying you that your eStatement is ready to view.
If you are not receiving the email notification, sign onto your online banking, click on Options, scroll to Email, and click Edit. Verify that your email address is input correctly. Also check your email account to make sure eStatement notifications are not being filed in your spam or junk mail folder. If they are, add edelivery@ccf.us to your address book to ensure notifications are delivered to your inbox.
What is the $1 charge that appears in my online Account Activity?
Sometimes merchants perform a test charge to verify your account before authorizing a debit card purchase. These charges are usually for a nominal amount such as $1. Once the actual purchase is charged to your account, the $1 test charge is removed.
Can I make a loan payment online?
Currently, you may only make a loan payment online if the payment is coming from another account with CCFBank. You may sign up for Direct Loan Payments by completing a Direct Loan Payment form and mailing it to P.O. Box 218, Altoona, WI 54720 or by dropping it off at your local office. We can also take loan payments over the phone via ACH or debit/credit card for a $10 fee. To do this, please contact our Customer Service Center at 800-590-9920.

Check the list of supported carriers on our website, at www.ccf.us/online-services/ealerts.
Set up an email alert instead of a text alert and add your phone number plus the SMS address for your carrier, (Example: 1234567891@vtext.com would be for a Verizon customer), as your email address.

*If you have problems receiving the message there may be an option with your carrier that is not enabled. Please contact your cellphone carrier for further information.
How do I set up eAlerts?

If you are enrolled in eAlerts there will be an eAlerts tab at the top of your online banking. Click on eAlerts to set up new alerts

For the daily available balance alerts, is there a certain time that the alerts come?
As of right now the morning alerts run in a 2-hour window between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.
*Please note that delays may occur and alerts may not always be received in this time frame
Why does it say "Record in use by another user or program" when I click the delete button next to an alert in online banking?
The event is temporarily unavailable for updating or deleting. Please log off online banking, wait at least an hour and log back on and try deleting the alert.
If I signed up to get the Downloadable application why does it still ask for my carrier when I want to setup a text alert?

An eAlert is an online notification that shows up under the eAlert tab in online banking, email is an email generated alert and text is a text generated alert.
What happens when I reply STOP to a text alert?
Replying STOP to a text alert will disable your mobile banking option of receiving alerts. However, this will not delete the alert from your eAlerts tab. In order to get re-enrolled to receive alerts please follow these step by step instructions.

*Note: You are not necessarily being double charged*
Mobile Banking with Mobile Deposit
Download our mobile and text banking user guide.
Is Mobile Banking secure?
Mobile Banking employs industry best practices with regards to security. It has been assessed against industry security criteria by a number of independent system security experts.
At a high level, Mobile Banking offers the following security safeguards:

Authentication – Mobile browser and application solution customers are authenticated for every interaction with any Mobile Banking component. Customers are authenticated by username and password or by utilizing existing login credentials for single sign-on.
Encryption – 128-bit encryption is used for all transactions within Mobile Banking and between Mobile Banking and other Fiserv solutions (e.g., core banking and payment systems).
Fraud – Mobile Banking incorporates mechanisms such as transaction validation and transaction reconciliation processes to detect fraud.
Availability/Resilience – Mobile Banking is protected against malicious attacks through software and server hardening measures.
Audit Ability – Mobile Banking provides full audit capabilities through event logs and event-based reporting.

Is my personal or financial information stored on my phone?
No. Mobile Banking does not save any files with personal or financial information on your mobile device. That information stays strictly within online banking. Some phones (e.g., BlackBerry, Android) have logo and branding files that are copied to the mobile device. Those files do not contain any personally identifiable information.
Which accounts can I access using Mobile Banking?
You can access any account you have set up in online banking. You select which accounts you want to access using Mobile Banking during the enrollment process.
How current is the account and transaction information?
When you view your account balance, you see the current available balance. When you view transaction history, you see the most recently posted transactions. Pending transactions do not display.
Can I add more than one mobile phone?
Yes. You can enroll several mobile devices for Mobile Banking. To add a new phone, complete the Mobile Banking Enrollment section in the Mobile Banking Guide.
What if my phone number changes?
If your mobile phone number changes, simply update your mobile phone number in Mobile Banking. To update the mobile phone number, complete the How To Change a Phone Number section.
What if my phone is lost or stolen?
If your mobile device is lost or stolen, no one can access your account without knowing your password and, in some cases, your unique user name. To prevent unauthorized access to your account, you can deactivate your phone in Mobile Banking. To deactivate your mobile device, complete the How To Deactivate or Stop Using a Mobile Device
How do I stop using Mobile Banking on my phone?

Phones on a number of different operating systems are supported including, but not limited, to Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Symbian, Windows Mobile, Linux, Palm webOS, and Maemo.
Which mobile service carriers support Mobile Banking?
Mobile Banking works on all major mobile service carriers in the U.S.: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile®, U.S. Cellular® and Verizon Wireless. Mobile Banking also works on a number of the smaller service carriers, including, but not limited to, Boost Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Metro PCS, Pioneer Cellular, Union Wireless and Virgin Mobile USA.

Tips for taking good check photos

Before logging into the CCFBank Mobile app, close all other apps running in the background of the mobile device.
Sign/Endorse the back of the check, and label it "For Deposit Only CCFTM Account."
When prompted for the amount, carefully enter the check amount to ensure it matches the amount written on the check.
Flatten folded or crumpled checks before taking the photos.
Ensure that only the check is visible in the view screen – no other objects or edges.
Ensure entire check image is visible and in focus before submitting the deposit.
Take the photos of the check in a well-lit area on a dark, non-reflective background.
Keep your phone flat and steady above the check when taking the photos.
Hold the camera as square to the check as possible to reduce corner to corner skew.
No shadows across the check.
All four corners of check are visible.
Check is not blurry. Shaky hands or being too close can make the object blurry.
The MICR line (numbers on the bottom of the check) is readable.

How do I know that my mobile deposit has been received / processed?
When you log onto your CCFBank Mobile app, click on the "Deposits" tab, click on "View Deposit History" you will be able to see all pending, accepted and failed deposits. Pending deposits have been received but not processed. Accepted deposits have been received and processed.

How can I view a check deposited via CCFBank Mobile Deposit through my mobile device?
After the mobile deposit has successfully completed, the image of the check can be accessed from a mobile device up to 30 days by following these steps:

Login to CCFBank Mobile Banking app;
Select "Deposit" option from the Main Menu;
Click on the "Transactions" option on the Deposit or Review Checks" screen, which will take you to a list of recent mobile deposits;

What should I do with the check after I've submitted a mobile deposit?
Upon the receipt of confirmation from CCFBank that we have received an image that you have transmitted, you agree to retain the check for at least thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the image transmission. After thirty (30) days, you agree to destroy the check that you transmitted as an image, mark it "VOID", or otherwise render it incapable of further transmission, deposit, or presentment.

What happens if a check deposited via CCFBank Mobile Deposit is returned?
If an original check deposited through CCFBank Mobile Deposit is dishonored, rejected or otherwise returned unpaid for any reason, the customer will receive an image, reproduction or substitute of the original check and we will charge the deposit amount back to the account.

Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. And Wells Financial Corp. To Merge






GlobeNewswire



Mar 17, 2017 4:48 PM EDT













 


















































  Key Acquisition and Financial Impact Highlights:  The transaction gives Citizens' subsidiary bank a strong market presence in southern Minnesota.  The merger provides Citizens with a stable low cost deposit base to support organic growth opportunities throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.   At closing, the merged entity is projected to have $940 million in assets with $725 million in loans and $750 million in deposits with twenty-five locations.   Stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $39.8 million based on the average closing price of Citizens common stock over a 20 day period ending on March 14, 2017, subject to potential adjustments as described in the Agreement.  The transaction is expected to generate earnings accretion of over 50% in the first full year after closing and tangible book value dilution earn back just over three years.   EAU CLAIRE, Wis. and WELLS, Minn., March 17, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZWI)  ("Citizens"), the parent company of Citizens Community Federal, N.A. ("CCFBank"), and Wells Financial Corp. ("Wells") (OTCQB:WEFP), the parent company of Wells Federal Bank, today jointly announced the execution of an agreement and plan of merger (the "Agreement") whereby Wells will merge into Citizens in a transaction valued at approximately $39.8 million. The transaction strengthens the presence and capacity of Citizens in Southern Minnesota, provides stable, low cost funding to support loan growth, and creates operating efficiencies in the combined franchise. The board of directors of both companies approved the transaction, which is subject to customary conditions, including the approvals of bank regulatory agencies and the shareholders of Wells. Shareholders of Wells will receive total consideration of $51.00 per share, which will consist of $41.31 in cash or 81% of the total consideration and the balance of the consideration will consist of .7636 shares of Citizens common stock for each share of Wells common stock.  The stock consideration is subject to a pricing collar adjustment in certain circumstances based on the price of Citizens common stock at the time of closing.

Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. and Wells Financial Corp. to Merge
Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. Increases Minnesota Market Share through Merger with Wells Financial Corp. 



















March 17, 2017 16:48 ET

 | Source: Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc.





Key Acquisition and Financial Impact Highlights:The transaction gives Citizens’ subsidiary bank a strong market presence in southern Minnesota. The merger provides Citizens with a stable low cost deposit base to support organic growth opportunities throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.  At closing, the merged entity is projected to have $940 million in assets with $725 million in loans and $750 million in deposits with twenty-five locations.  Stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $39.8 million based on the average closing price of Citizens common stock over a 20 day period ending on March 14, 2017, subject to potential adjustments as described in the Agreement. The transaction is expected to generate earnings accretion of over 50% in the first full year after closing and tangible book value dilution earn back just over three years. EAU CLAIRE, Wis. and WELLS, Minn., March  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZWI) (“Citizens”), the parent company of Citizens Community Federal, N.A. (“CCFBank”), and Wells Financial Corp. (“Wells”) (OTCQB:WEFP), the parent company of Wells Federal Bank, today jointly announced the execution of an agreement and plan of merger (the “Agreement”) whereby Wells will merge into Citizens in a transaction valued at approximately $39.8 million. The transaction strengthens the presence and capacity of Citizens in Southern Minnesota, provides stable, low cost funding to support loan growth, and creates operating efficiencies in the combined franchise.The board of directors of both companies approved the transaction, which is subject to customary conditions, including the approvals of bank regulatory agencies and the shareholders of Wells. Shareholders of Wells will receive total consideration of $51.00 per share, which will consist of $41.31 in cash or 81% of the total consideration and the balance of the consideration will consist of .7636 shares of Citizens common stock for each share of Wells common stock.  The stock consideration is subject to a pricing collar adjustment in certain circumstances based on the price of Citizens common stock at the time of closing. “We are excited about this opportunity to combine two independent community banking franchises into a larger bank serving northwest Wisconsin and south central Minnesota where Citizens already has three branches. The pooling of our personnel, resources and knowledge will enhance our capabilities, operational efficiencies, and community outreach and will provide us with a deeper product offering and increased lending capacity to better serve our clients and our communities and should also enhance shareholder value.  We expect the merger to close early in the third calendar quarter of 2017, and to be accretive to earnings in fiscal year 2018,” stated Stephen Bianchi, President and CEO of Citizens.“Our team looks forward to growing and thriving with the Citizens team,” said James D. Moll, Wells President and Chief Executive Officer. “Given the challenges and opportunities of community banking today, the combined bank will be better positioned to meet the needs of our communities than as two independent organizations. We share a common set of values and a vision that will provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders.”“Wells brings $268.5 million in assets, $233.0 million in deposits and $198.4 million in loans to the Citizens franchise,” said Bianchi.  “The transaction is a transformative event for us, as it better balances the mix of both our deposit base and loan portfolio, improves our margins and earnings outlook and expands our franchise into new, culturally compatible markets.”The shares of Citizens common stock issued to Wells shareholders will be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.FIG Partners acted as financial advisor to Citizens in the transaction and delivered a fairness opinion to the Board of Directors of Citizens and Briggs & Morgan served as outside legal counsel to Citizens. McAuliffe Financial, LLC, acted as financial advisor and delivered a fairness opinion to the Board of Wells, and Jones Walker LLP, Washington, D.C., served as legal counsel to Wells.About Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. and Citizens Community Federal BankCitizens Community Federal N.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc., is a full-service national bank based in Altoona, Wisconsin, serving more than 50,000 customers in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan through 16 branch locations.

These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “planned,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” “would” or the negative of those terms or other words of similar meaning. Such forward-looking statements in this release are inherently subject to many uncertainties arising in CCFBank’s operations and business environment. These uncertainties include the timing to consummate the proposed transaction; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed transaction may not be satisfied and the transaction may not close; the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed transaction is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the combined company’s ability to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; management’s ability to promptly and effectively integrate the businesses of the two companies; the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues; the effects of governmental regulation of the financial services industry; industry consolidation; technological developments and major world news events; general economic conditions, in particular, relating to consumer demand for CCFBank’s products and services; CCFBank’s ability to maintain current deposit and loan levels at current interest rates; competitive and technological developments; deteriorating credit quality, including changes in the interest rate environment reducing interest margins; prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions; CCFBank’s ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity; maintaining capital requirements may limit CCFBank’s operations and potential growth; changes and trends in capital markets; competitive pressures among depository institutions; effects of critical accounting estimates and judgments; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other regulatory agencies overseeing CCFBank; CCFBank’s ability to implement its cost-savings and revenue enhancement initiatives, including costs associated with its branch consolidation and new market branch growth initiatives; legislative or regulatory changes or actions or significant litigation adversely affecting CCFBank; fluctuation of Citizens’ stock price; CCFBank's ability to attract and retain key personnel; CCFBank's ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; and the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Such uncertainties and other risks that may affect Citizens’ performance are discussed further in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in Citizens’ Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 29, 2016. Citizens undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this news release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release.Contact:
