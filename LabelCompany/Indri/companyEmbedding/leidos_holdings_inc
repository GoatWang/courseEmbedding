Learn More 





1970
Posted first profits; won a new relationship

Leidos posted a profit after its first year, much to its founder’s surprise, and established its first long-term client, the Defense Nuclear Agency.





1984
Helped design America’s Cup winner

We supported the technical design of the winning yacht for the America’s Cup and began conceptual design for a geologic nuclear waste repository in Nevada.





1996
Made a bold, strategic acquisition

The company’s entrepreneurial spirit and small-company flexibility kept us at the forefront of new technology. We acquired domain name registrar Network Solutions and became one of the largest providers of Internet and e-commerce services.





2008
Built first-of-its-kind solar community

We played a major role in helping Okotoks, Alberta become the first solar community in North America. Our Canadian subsidiary developed a solar-thermal system to capture energy from the summer sun and store it to heat homes through the long, cold winter.





2013
Formally split into Leidos and SAIC

The company officially split into Leidos, a $6 billion solutions-focused business, and SAIC, a $4 billion services business.





2016
COMBINES WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN'S IS&GS

Leidos expands to 32,000 employees across locations in 30 countries. The company reported pro forma annual revenues of approximately $10 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 1, 2016.

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

History[edit]




Company Logo, 2010


The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]

Former subsidiaries[edit]
AMSEC LLC, a business partnership between SAIC and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Newport News Shipbuilding divested on July 13, 2007.[citation needed] Network Solutions was acquired by SAIC in 1995,[36] and subsequently was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. for $21 billion.[37]
Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

History[edit]




Company Logo, 2010


The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]

AMSEC LLC, a business partnership between SAIC and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Newport News Shipbuilding divested on July 13, 2007.[citation needed] Network Solutions was acquired by SAIC in 1995,[36] and subsequently was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. for $21 billion.[37]
Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

History[edit]




Company Logo, 2010


The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., formerly SAIC - Frederick, a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos manages Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.[33]
MEDPROTECT, LLC supports US government health-payer organizations[33]

QTC Management, Inc., acquired by merging with Lockheed Martin IS&GS.
Systems Made Simple (SMS), acquired by merging with Lockheed Martin IS&GS.
Leidos Cyber, Inc., formerly Lockheed Martin Industry Defender, acquired by merging with Lockheed Martin IS&GS.

Former subsidiaries[edit]
AMSEC LLC, a business partnership between SAIC and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Newport News Shipbuilding divested on July 13, 2007.[citation needed] Network Solutions was acquired by SAIC in 1995,[36] and subsequently was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. for $21 billion.[37]
Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

History[edit]




Company Logo, 2010


The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]

Former subsidiaries[edit]
AMSEC LLC, a business partnership between SAIC and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Newport News Shipbuilding divested on July 13, 2007.[citation needed] Network Solutions was acquired by SAIC in 1995,[36] and subsequently was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. for $21 billion.[37]
Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

Leidos Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Leidos Wins Prime Contract from the Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
Jul 19 17
Leidos was awarded a prime contract by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to provide engineering services for an energy and water savings program designed to promote the use of renewable energy technologies. The multiple-award indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract has a five-year base ordering period, an eighteen month option, and a total contract value of approximately $55 billion for all awardees. Under the Department of Energy IDIQ ESPC, Leidos will design, construct, and install an energy and water savings program intended to promote the use of renewable energy technologies, acquire energy and water conservation services, reduce energy or water consumption and associated utility costs, and reduce energy and water-related operations and maintenance costs.


Leidos Awards Army Contract for Software Modernization
Jul 18 17
Leidos was awarded a prime contract by the U.S. Army to provide systems engineering, software development and integration on the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). This single-award, cost-plus incentive-fee contract has a three-year base period of performance and one two-year option. If all options are exercised, the contract is valued at more than $102 million. The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides critical artillery systems fires command and control capability for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Under this contract, Leidos will modernize AFATDS to improve functionality, support a more intuitive user software interface, enable more simplistic user training, and enable migration of AFATDS software into the Army's software Common Operating Environment - an initiative that is transitioning standalone warfighting software capabilities as integrated software applications. These efforts will result in a more robust system with vastly improved user functionality in both training and combat.


Leidos Wins $64 Million Task Order from U.S. Army
Jul 17 17
Leidos was awarded a task order from the U.S. Army to integrate, test and demonstrate the three complete Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E) systems under the ARL-E program of record. The single-award cost-plus fixed-fee task order has a one-year base period of performance, two nine-month options, and a total contract value of approximately $64 million if the options are exercised. Work will be performed primarily at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. The ARL-E is a manned multi-intelligent airborne platform that provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify and track surface targets in day/night, near-all-weather conditions, with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. Building on decades of operation and technical integration expertise on airborne systems, Leidos will integrate the previously delivered Mission Equipment Payload (MEP) onto the DHC-8 aircraft, including testing and delivery of the complete ARL-E system. Under the option periods, Leidos will integrate the second and third MEP on ARL-E systems 2 and 3. Work will culminate with a system demonstration and delivery of up to three complete ARL-E systems.

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

History[edit]




Company Logo, 2010


The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]

Former subsidiaries[edit]
AMSEC LLC, a business partnership between SAIC and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Newport News Shipbuilding divested on July 13, 2007.[citation needed] Network Solutions was acquired by SAIC in 1995,[36] and subsequently was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. for $21 billion.[37]
Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

History[edit]




Company Logo, 2010


The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]

Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

Headquarters at Reston Town Center.


Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]

SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
