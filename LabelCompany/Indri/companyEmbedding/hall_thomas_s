						About					

Whether you're buying, selling, refinancing, or building your dream home, you have a lot riding on your loan officer. Since market conditions and mortgage programs change frequently, you need to make sure you're dealing with a top professional who is able to give you quick and accurate financial advice. As an experienced loan officer I have the knowledge and expertise you need to explore the many financing options available. Ensuring that you make the right choice for you and your family is my ultimate goal, and I am committed to providing my customers with mortgage services that exceed their expectations. I hope you'll browse my website, check out the different loan programs I have available, use my decision-making tools and calculators, and use our secure online application to get started. After you've applied, I'll call you to discuss the details of your loan, or you may choose to set up an appointment with me using my online form. As always, you may contact me anytime by phone, fax or email for personalized service and expert advice. I look forward to working with you.














Thank you for being such a reliable company. After a stressful experience with a different mortgage bank, I was hesitant to follow a friend’s advice to call Movement Mortgage. I am so grateful that I made the call, because Movement not only gave me a painless and efficient experience, but instilled in me the faith and confidence I had lost from the unsuccessful approach and process of another mortgage lender. Thank You.			     	-Dominique W
