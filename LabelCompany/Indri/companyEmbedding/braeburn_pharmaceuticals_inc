Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Announces FDA Approves Probuphine® (buprenorphine) Implant: The First Implant for Treatment of Opioid Dependence 
Posted on May 27, 2016January 19, 2017 by brae_user 



 
Patients and Providers Have a New Option to Combat Opioid Dependence
PRINCETON, N.J.—May 26, 2016—Braeburn Pharmaceuticals announces that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved Probuphine, the first implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who have sustained clinical stability on low-to-moderate doses of buprenorphine, specifically 8 mg or less per day. Probuphine delivers buprenorphine continuously for up to six months and should be used as part of a complete treatment program to include counseling and psychosocial support.
“Patients and their doctors now have Probuphine as a new option for the six-month treatment of opioid dependence. Opioid addiction is a chronic disease and should be treated the same way we treat other serious, chronic diseases—with evidence-based medicine,” said President and CEO Behshad Sheldon, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals. “With 78 people in the U.S. dying each day from opioids, it’s important that patients have more treatments to choose from as no one option will work for everyone. Probuphine is the first of what we hope will be many new and innovative approaches to treating this disease. We are grateful to all of the patients, investigators and to NIDA for their help and dedication that has brought us to this point. ”
Buprenorphine is a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of opioid dependence. Until today, it has only been available in sublingual (oral) formulations. Probuphine received a priority review based on the potential to reduce accidental pediatric exposure.
“Probuphine is the first treatment for opioid dependence that provides long-term delivery of an evidence-based medicine,” said Richard Rosenthal, Professor of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Medical Director of Addiction Psychiatry, Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System. “Probuphine offers clinically stable patients a new way to continue taking medicine, ensuring the dose prescribed is the dose taken.”
The systemic side effects for Probuphine are similar to those that are seen with buprenorphine and in the Probuphine clinical trials included: headache, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, anxiety, back pain, depression, constipation, and vomiting. In addition, common implant site reactions included pain, itching, redness and swelling.
“Probuphine represents a significant step forward in addressing the serious lack of new treatment options in the last 15 years. With strong support from the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services this year to expand access to medication assisted treatment, addiction specialists like myself are more confident we will be able to get more patients the treatment they desperately need,” said Kelly J. Clark, MD, MBA, DFASAM, DFAPA, President Elect, American Society of Addiction Medicine, Chief Medical Officer, CleanSlate Centers. “Opioid dependence touches people from all walks of life, no matter their socioeconomic status, race or gender; the more we educate and innovate the better chance we have at reducing the prevalence of this terrible disease.”
“Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid dependence but was previously only available in pill or film formulation which can be lost, forgotten or stolen,” said Frank J. Vocci, Ph.D., president and senior research scientist, Friends Research Institute. “Probuphine’s inherent value as an implant is that patients receive constant levels of buprenorphine for up to six months without having to administer treatment on a daily basis. This is an unprecedented benefit of a treatment for opioid dependence.”
About Probuphine
Probuphine was developed using ProNeura™, Titan Pharmaceuticals’ (NASDAQ: TTNP) continuous drug delivery system that consists of a small, solid implant made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and a drug substance. The resulting construct is a solid matrix that is placed subdermally, normally in the upper arm in an outpatient office procedure, and removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period. Probuphine implants are 26 millimeters long and 2.5 millimeters in diameter, or about the size of a matchstick. Each implant contains the equivalent of 80 mg of buprenorphine and is placed under the skin in the inner side of the upper arm.
INDICATION STATEMENT
PROBUPHINE is indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who have achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability on low-to-moderate doses of a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product (i.e., doses of no more than 8 mg per day of Subutex or Suboxone sublingual tablet or generic equivalent).
PROBUPHINE should be used as part of a complete treatment program to include counseling and psychosocial support.
PROBUPHINE is not appropriate for new entrants to treatment and patients who have not achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability, while being maintained on buprenorphine 8 mg per day or less of a Subutex or Suboxone sublingual tablet or generic equivalent.
WARNING: IMPLANT MIGRATION, PROTRUSION, EXPULSION and NERVE DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH INSERTION and REMOVAL
Risk Associated with Insertion and Removal
Insertion and removal of PROBUPHINE are associated with the risk of implant migration, protrusion, expulsion resulting from the procedure. Rare but serious complications including nerve damage and migration resulting in embolism and death may result from improper insertion of drug implants inserted in the upper arm. Additional complications may include local migration, protrusion and expulsion. Incomplete insertions or infections may lead to protrusion or expulsion.
Because of the risks associated with insertion and removal, PROBUPHINE is available only through a restricted program called the PROBUPHINE REMS Program. All Healthcare Providers must successfully complete a live training program on the insertion and removal procedures and become certified, prior to performing insertions or prescribing PROBUPHINE implants. Patients must be monitored to ensure that PROBUPHINE is removed by a healthcare provider certified to perform insertions.
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any other ingredients in PROBUPHINE (e.g., EVA).

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Serious Complications from Insertion and Removal: Rare but serious complications including nerve damage and migration resulting in embolism and death may result from improper insertion of drug implants inserted in the upper arm. Additional complications may include local migration, protrusion and expulsion. Incomplete insertions or infections may lead to protrusion or expulsion. All Healthcare Providers must successfully complete a live training program on the insertion and removal procedures and become certified in the PROBUPHINE REMS program, prior to performing insertions or prescribing PROBUPHINE implants.
Addiction, Abuse and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors.
Respiratory and CNS Depression: Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants when used concomitantly.
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome(NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy.
Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid.
Unintentional Pediatric Exposure: In the event an implant protrudes or comes out, keep the implant away from children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children.
Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately.
Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment.
Risk of Withdrawal in Patients Dependent on Full Agonist Opioids: Verify that patient is clinically stable on transmucosal buprenorphine and not dependent on full agonists before inserting PROBUPHINE.
Treatment of Emergent Acute Pain: Treat pain with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible. If opioid therapy is required, monitor patients closely because higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.
Most common side effects of PROBUPHINE include: headache, insomnia, rhinorrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, anxiety, back pain, depression, constipation, and vomiting.

About Opioid Use Disorder and Buprenorphine
Opioid use disorder is a chronic brain disease and one of the fastest growing public health epidemics in America. In the U.S., 2.5 million people struggle with opioid addiction and, according to the Centers for Disease Control, 78 people die each day from the disease. There is a growing body of evidence that opioid addiction is not a choice or a moral failing, but the result of genetic predisposition combined with environmental factors. Nonetheless, individuals struggling with this disease continue to be stigmatized. Research has also shown that opioid use disorder is best treated with a combination of medication and psychosocial support. The majority of individuals with opioid addiction cannot sustain recovery without long-term outpatient medical treatment.
Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, which may help individuals to stop opioid use without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine is currently only available in oral form and must be taken daily.

Probuphine® (buprenorphine) Implant Phase 3 Data Presented at CPDD Annual Scientific Meeting 
Posted on June 17, 2016January 19, 2017 by brae_user 



 
Results Demonstrate the Superiority of Probuphine for Abstinence from Opioids for Patients over Six Months   
Princeton, NJ and Palm Springs, CA — June 16, 2016—Braeburn Pharmaceuticals presented data yesterday from the poster of the Phase 3 study of Probuphine, a six-month subdermal buprenorphine implant for the long-term maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, at the 78th Annual Scientific Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Probuphine on May 26, 2016.
The study demonstrates that participants who were clinically stable on sublingual buprenorphine maintained stability when transferred to Probuphine and that they were more likely to sustain abstinence from illicit opioids throughout the six months than participants who remained on sublingual buprenorphine.
Primary efficacy analysis originally presented showed that 96.4 percent of participants in the Probuphine group had at least four months without evidence of drug use versus 87.6 percent in the sublingual buprenorphine group, demonstrating superiority of Probuphine with a p value of 0.034.
Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to support the robustness of the primary analysis, including the following that were presented at CPDD:
– Statistically significant difference between Probuphine and sublingual buprenorphine in the proportion of subjects for all 6 months without evidence of illicit opioid use (85.7% versus 71.9%, p=0.03).  Imputation of all missing values as positive for illicit opioids also demonstrated significant difference (80.5% versus 67.4%, p=0.05).
– A more conservative approach, including the use of supplemental sublingual buprenorphine as non-responders as well as imputing all missing values as positive for illicit opioid use, illustrated similar results for Probuphine and sublingual buprenorphine (63.2% versus 53.9%, p=0.21).
“Non-adherence to medication approved to treat opioid dependence is a leading cause of relapse,” said Frank J. Vocci, Ph.D., president and senior research scientist, Friends Research Institute. “The study results show that more participants in the implant group sustained at least four months of abstinence from opioids than participants in the sublingual buprenorphine group. Implanted just under the skin, Probuphine encourages treatment adherence and adds a new treatment for doctors to utilize to address the opioid dependence epidemic.”
“In the three weeks since we received FDA approval for Probuphine, we have trained over 800 Healthcare Providers who have already begun treating their patients with Probuphine,” said Behshad Sheldon, CEO, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals. “We recognize the importance to both physicians and patients of this new treatment for opioid dependence and are working to train 5,000 healthcare providers before the end of the year.  We are currently conducting training sessions every weekend to accommodate the interest that has been expressed from qualified healthcare providers.”
For more information about training healthcare providers can visit www.ProbuphineREMS.com or call 1-866-397-8939.
About Probuphine
Probuphine is the only six-month treatment for opioid dependence and was developed using ProNeura™, Titan Pharmaceuticals’ (NASDAQ: TTNP) continuous drug delivery system that consists of a small, solid implant made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and a drug substance. The resulting construct is a solid matrix that is placed subdermally, normally in the upper arm in an outpatient office procedure, and removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period. Probuphine implants are 26 millimeters long and 2.5 millimeters in diameter, or about the size of a matchstick. Each implant contains the equivalent of 80 mg of buprenorphine and is placed under the skin in the inner side of the upper arm.
INDICATION STATEMENT
PROBUPHINE is indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who have achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability on low-to-moderate doses of a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product (i.e., doses of no more than 8 mg per day of Subutex or Suboxone sublingual tablet or generic equivalent).
PROBUPHINE should be used as part of a complete treatment program to include counseling and psychosocial support.
PROBUPHINE is not appropriate for new entrants to treatment and patients who have not achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability, while being maintained on buprenorphine 8 mg per day or less of a Subutex or Suboxone sublingual tablet or generic equivalent.
WARNING: IMPLANT MIGRATION, PROTRUSION, EXPULSION and NERVE DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH INSERTION and REMOVAL
Risk Associated with Insertion and Removal
Insertion and removal of PROBUPHINE are associated with the risk of implant migration, protrusion, expulsion resulting from the procedure. Rare but serious complications including nerve damage and migration resulting in embolism and death may result from improper insertion of drug implants inserted in the upper arm. Additional complications may include local migration, protrusion and expulsion. Incomplete insertions or infections may lead to protrusion or expulsion.
Because of the risks associated with insertion and removal, PROBUPHINE is available only through a restricted program called the PROBUPHINE REMS Program. All Healthcare Providers must successfully complete a live training program on the insertion and removal procedures and become certified, prior to performing insertions or prescribing PROBUPHINE implants. Patients must be monitored to ensure that PROBUPHINE is removed by a healthcare provider certified to perform insertions.
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any other ingredients in PROBUPHINE (e.g., EVA).

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Serious Complications from Insertion and Removal: Rare but serious complications including nerve damage and migration resulting in embolism and death may result from improper insertion of drug implants inserted in the upper arm. Additional complications may include local migration, protrusion and expulsion. Incomplete insertions or infections may lead to protrusion or expulsion. All Healthcare Providers must successfully complete a live training program on the insertion and removal procedures and become certified in the PROBUPHINE REMS program, prior to performing insertions or prescribing PROBUPHINE implants.
Addiction, Abuse and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors.
Respiratory and CNS Depression: Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants when used concomitantly.
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome(NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy.
Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid.
Unintentional Pediatric Exposure: In the event an implant protrudes or comes out, keep the implant away from children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children.
Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately.
Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment.
Risk of Withdrawal in Patients Dependent on Full Agonist Opioids: Verify that patient is clinically stable on transmucosal buprenorphine and not dependent on full agonists before inserting PROBUPHINE.
Treatment of Emergent Acute Pain: Treat pain with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible. If opioid therapy is required, monitor patients closely because higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.
Most common side effects of PROBUPHINE include: headache, insomnia, rhinorrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, anxiety, back pain, depression, constipation, and vomiting.

Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Camurus and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Announce Phase 2 Results for Long-Acting Buprenorphine in Opioid Dependent Patients with Chronic Pain
Jul 12 17
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals and Camurus announced the positive results from a Phase 2 pharmacokinetic study of weekly and monthly buprenorphine (CAM2038) depots in opioid dependent patients with moderate-to-severe non-cancer chronic pain. A total of 65 participants were enrolled and received one of three doses of CAM2038 after being transitioned from sublingual buprenorphine. The primary study objective was to characterize steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles after repeated dosing of CAM2038, including subcutaneous (SC) injections into four different injection sites. Other outcomes were safety and local tolerability, as well as measures of pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms. The PK results confirmed the target weekly and monthly dosing intervals for the CAM2038 depots, showing extended buprenorphine release with dose dependent steady-state through concentrations in the 2 to 3 ng/mL range. Both pain and opioid withdrawal scores continued to be well controlled after transitioning from sublingual buprenorphine total daily doses of 24 mg and above. As in previous clinical studies, CAM2038 was shown to be well tolerated. Except for mild-to-moderate injection site reactions observed in four patients (6.2%), the safety profile was consistent with that of daily transmucosal buprenorphine medications.


Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Announces Management Changes
Jun 14 17
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals has appointed Michael Derkacz as president and chief executive officer of the company. Derkacz has replaced Behshad Sheldon. Prior to this appointment, Derkacz worked for Teva Pharmaceuticals as its SVP and general manager, Global CNS. He has also worked with National Pharmaceutical Council, Cephalon and GlaxoSmithKline.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock
that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $137.2 million, based
upon an assumed initial public offering price of $19.50 per share, which is the
midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters'
option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate
that our net proceeds would be approximately $158.2 million, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$19.50 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus would increase or decrease the
net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $7.2 million,
assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page
of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. Similarly, each increase
or decrease of one million in the number of shares of common stock offered by us
would increase or decrease the net proceeds that we receive from this offering
by approximately $18.1 million, assuming the assumed initial public offering
price remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions payable by us. A one million share increase in the number of
shares offered by us together with a concomitant $1.00 increase in the assumed
initial public offering price of $19.50 per share, which is the midpoint of the
estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
would increase the net proceeds to us from this offering by $26.2 million after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. Conversely, a one million share decrease in the
number of shares offered by us together with a concomitant $1.00 decrease in the
assumed initial public offering price of $19.50 per share, which is the midpoint
of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by $24.4 million after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:

• commercialization of Probuphine, advancement of product candidates in
  clinical development; and

• the remaining proceeds, if any, to fund new and ongoing research and
  development activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  which may include funding for the hiring of additional personnel, capital
  expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, together with the net proceeds to us from this offering and the
concurrent private placement, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at
least the next 12 months.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from nonclinical studies and any
ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future, as
well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our
product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities.


The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic
competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Our marketed
product and any product candidates, that are approved and commercialized,
compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in
the future. We face potential competition from various sources, including larger
and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and
public and private research institutions.

Our principal competition in the opioid addiction market comes from
manufacturers of oral buprenorphine products, including Indivior Plc, or
Indivior, which markets the Suboxone and Subutex brands. We may also face
additional competition in the long-acting buprenorphine market from Indivior if
its product candidate RBP-6000, a monthly buprenorphine injection in Phase 3
development, is approved for U.S. marketing. We are not aware of any injectable
or implantable buprenorphine products in clinical-stage development besides
Indivior's.

We anticipate that our primary competitors for CAM2038 and Probuphine for
chronic pain, will be manufacturers of opioid analgesics such as oxycodone that
are available at doses equivalent to 80 mg per day of morphine. We are not aware
of any implantable or injectable opioid products, including buprenorphine
products, in clinical-stage development for pain indications.

We expect our primary competitor for BB0817 will be Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the
manufacturer of long-acting injectable formulations of risperidone, marketing
bi-weekly and monthly injectable formulations of risperidone or compounds
resembling risperidone under the brand names Consta and Sustenna. Indivior is in
late-clinical-stage development of RBP-7000, a monthly risperidone injection
based on the same injection technology as used in its RBP-6000 buprenorphine
injection. We expect to have secondary competitors in the manufacturers of
injectable formulations of aripiprazole, another atypical antipsychotic. These
include Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., which markets a monthly injectable
formulation of aripiprazole under the brand name Abilify Maintena and 
Alkermes Inc., which manufactures a monthly injectable formulation of the
closely-related molecule aripiprazole lauroxil under the brand name Aristada.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have
substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and
significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product
candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates
and commercializing those product candidates.

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may
result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our
competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining
qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial
sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring
technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or
early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly
through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new
product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on
the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of
administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from
government and other third-party payors.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any
products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other
regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain
approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong
market position before we are able to enter the market.


Company Description
We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of novel long-acting medications for serious disorders of the
central nervous system, or CNS. Our proprietary implantable and injectable
delivery mechanisms provide differentiated solutions for chronic


 diseases with
high unmet medical needs. Our specialty CNS focus is on fast-growing therapeutic
areas recognized as serious public health crises, where long-acting technologies
offer important benefits such as increased medication compliance, improved 
patient convenience, reduced risk of abuse and relapse and reduced public health
and societal costs.

Our lead therapeutic area is opioid addiction, which affects 2.6 million people
in the United States across all socioeconomic groups. A 2016 survey from the
Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that nearly half of all Americans know
someone who suffers from opioid addiction. We have one approved product,
Probuphine, a six-month buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of
opioid addiction, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA, on May 26, 2016. In November 2016, we reported positive top-line results
from a Phase 3 trial of weekly and monthly CAM2038, an injectable formulation of
buprenorphine, for opioid addiction. CAM2038 achieved non-inferiority compared
to oral daily buprenorphine based on the primary endpoint and superiority to
oral daily buprenorphine based on a secondary endpoint. Our other therapeutic
areas of focus are pain, schizophrenia and spasticity, which refers to feelings
of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms. We have four
additional late-stage product candidates in our pipeline across our different
therapeutic areas, as well as two earlier-stage product candidates.

We believe that long-acting medications for specialty CNS conditions are not
just a matter of convenience, but are an essential tool for the effective
treatment of these diseases. These are chronic CNS conditions requiring constant
vigilance, where the consequences of suboptimal treatment compliance can range
from severe to life-threatening. For our therapeutic areas of focus, we are
developing weekly, monthly and six-month dosage formulations. We believe that
our medications will allow healthcare providers to treat patients throughout the
continuum of care, providing personalized drug delivery that is optimized to
help patients progress from treatment initiation through long-term maintenance.

To date, our post-approval commercialization efforts for Probuphine have been
focused on a medical affairs driven introduction, including training healthcare
providers to prescribe and implant Probuphine, working with payors to ensure
comprehensive reimbursement and implementing our new specialty pharmacy
distribution model. We are planning a full-scale commercial launch of Probuphine
with our new fully-deployed field force in the first quarter of 2017, which we
intend to further expand if and when we launch CAM2038.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.
