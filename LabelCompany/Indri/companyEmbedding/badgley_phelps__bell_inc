﻿Badgley Phelps: financial planning & wealth managementhttps://www.badgley.com/  urn:uuid:10ddf344-abe9-6626-a8f8-ff0000ddfb2ahttps://www.badgley.com/blog/blog/2017/07/24/tax-and-other-implications-of-receiving-an-inheritance Tax and other implications of receiving an inheritance <p> <span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>By <a href="https://www.badgley.com/people/jeff-walters">Jeff Walters</a></em></span> </p>
<p>Debuting on The New York Times&rsquo; best-seller list, <em>The Nest</em> chronicles the lives of four siblings as they approach the date when they&rsquo;re supposed to receive a large inheritance. The tale by Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney may be fiction but, as we&rsquo;ve seen with clients facing planned or unexpected inheritances, the associated emotion is real. To help anyone currently in or facing the inheritance process, here are several questions to ask. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">1. What type of property have I received and what are the tax implications?</span></h5>
<p>An inheritance can take the form of any type of property: cash, savings accounts, stocks, bonds, retirement plans or collectibles. You may even receive an income stream such as royalties or a pension. It&rsquo;s important to determine the tax implications of the property and type of ownership. This is a good time to talk to a CPA who specializes in this area. The following are explanations of the tax implications of different types of properties: </p>
<p><strong>Cost basis (step-up)</strong> &ndash; Most property will have a step-up in cost basis, which means if you sell the investment later, the tax you owe will be based on any gains/losses starting on the day of death. This could be a large advantage if the investment has appreciated significantly while the decedent owned it.</p>
<p><strong>Estate taxes (Federal and State)</strong> &ndash; The current Federal estate tax exemption amount is $5.49 million in 2017 per person ($10.98 million for a married couple). The Washington State estate tax exemption amount is $2.129 million per person in 2017.&nbsp; Spouses can pass an unlimited amount to each other. </p>
<p><strong>Income taxes from dividends, interest, capital gains</strong> &ndash; For <strong>Non-Retirement Plans</strong>, there&rsquo;s usually no income tax due on the inheritance itself. If the funds are currently generating any taxable income, you will be responsible to pay these taxes going forward. <strong>Retirement Plans</strong> &ndash; Depending on the type of retirement plan, you have a few options. A spouse that inherits an IRA will have the option of either taking a lump sum (generally not recommended), transferring the funds to their own IRA or opening an Inherited IRA. A non-spouse beneficiary won&rsquo;t have the option of transferring the funds to their own IRA, but can still use an Inherited IRA. Generally, these IRAs will need to be distributed within five years, or can be stretched out over the beneficiary&rsquo;s life expectancy. It&rsquo;s important to work with your CPA and financial planner to make sure you&rsquo;re implementing this strategy correctly.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">2. What should I do with the money?</span></h5>
<p>One important piece of advice that we counsel clients to follow when they receive an inheritance (or any other large windfall such as a gift or lottery winnings) is to go slow. In general, it&rsquo;s OK to leave things alone while you go through the process of adjusting and thinking about your financial goals. This is a good time to start or update your financial plan. The financial planning process will help you think about your values and turn these into specific financial goals. This is the best way to make sure that you&rsquo;re using these funds in a way that truly lines up with your values. </p>
<p>Once your financial plan is updated, you can implement an investment strategy that makes sense given your objectives (what the money is for), timeframe (when you need the money), and tolerance for market risk.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">3. What else should I consider?  </span></h5>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t think beyond the influx and associated taxes when they receive an inheritance. We think it&rsquo;s also a good time to update your critical documents and consider charitable giving.  </p>
<h4>Update your critical documents  </h4>
<p>Make sure the following documents are in place and up-to-date, reflecting your post-inheritance financial status and goals: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Durable Power of Attorney, which designates the person assigned to make financial decisions on your behalf in the event of your incapacity.</li>
    <li>Healthcare Power of Attorney, which designates the person empowered to make healthcare decisions on your behalf should you become incapacitated.</li>
    <li>Wills and Trusts, which ensures property is passed according to an individual's wishes. Wills should bequeath property in the same way other documents do, such as your retirement account or insurance policy. The will should also include guardianship designations for your minor children.</li>
    <li>Beneficiary designations identify who will receive your assets. Some assets, like retirement accounts, can pass along after death without being included in a will. After an inheritance, it&rsquo;s important to update the beneficiaries on the new accounts, particularly IRAs. </li>
    <li>Letter of Intent, which outlines your wishes for your assets. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Consider charitable giving </h4>
<p>If you are charitably inclined, the year in which you receive an inheritance could be a good time to consider making an extra contribution to an organization that you favor, or to think about your giving plan going forward. Depending on your individual situation there may be tax benefits to giving during the inheritance year, especially if your tax bracket is higher due to income from the inheritance.&nbsp; We recommend that you discuss these strategies with a qualified tax advisor before making any decisions. </p>
<p>When considering how, when and where to give, it&rsquo;s important to think about which giving option fits best with your goals, whether direct or indirect gifts. While direct gifts of cash or stock are the most common type of contribution, sometimes it makes more sense to give indirectly through donor-advised funds or foundations.  </p>
<p>Receiving an inheritance can be a life changing event. There are several issues to think about including the tax implications, investment strategy, and your personal financial goals and objectives.

</span></h5>
<h4>Economy </h4>
<p>Consistent with the trend of the last few years, the economy was soft in the first quarter with growth of just 1.4%. However, we expect the rate of growth to increase as we progress through the remainder of the year, just as it has in the recent past. Sustained gains in the labor market combined with low rates of inflation suggest that the expansion can continue with little risk of overheating. Given the sustained improvement in the labor market, our central bank raised interest rates twice in the first half of 2017 and has provided guidance that there will be another hike later this year.  </p>
<h4>Inflation </h4>
<p>After peaking in February of this year, inflation rates have been slowly declining. This phenomenon has spread beyond volatile commodities, such as oil, with prices falling in recent months for automobiles, apparel and telephone calling plans. Looking forward, we expect inflation to stabilize close to current levels given strength in the labor market, rising capacity utilization and a continuation of the economic expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>
<h4>U.S. Dollar </h4>
<p>The U.S. dollar has declined steadily this year, but remains at a historically high level. Improving fundamentals in foreign economies and slower than expected growth in the U.S. has increased demand for foreign currencies. In the coming months, we expect the dollar to stabilize as foreign economies are improving, but remain somewhat soft while the U.S. expansion is firmly entrenched.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Asset Class  </span></h5>
<h4>Cash/Money Market Instruments </h4>
<p>With three Federal Reserve rate hikes in six months and U.S. money market reforms almost nine months behind us, the money markets are starting to approach normalcy. Yields on money market funds and short-term bonds have appreciated along with the Federal Reserve policy moves. This rise is likely to continue over the course of this year and next as policymakers are expected to continue with rate normalization.  </p>
<h4>Intermediate Government/Credit Bonds </h4>
<p>Intermediate-term bond yields appear to have settled into a range with the five-year U.S. Treasury trading between 1.7% and 2.2% this year. Incremental moves within the range are likely to continue until there is a clear break in economic data, a shift in monetary policy or implementation of fiscal policies that would change the outlook for inflation and growth. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue reducing the level of stimulus as they have provided guidance that they expect to raise interest rates one more time this year.&nbsp;There are also indications that they will begin reducing the size of their $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.&nbsp;However, the course of their future policy remains fluid as it is data dependent.  </p>
<h4>Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds </h4>
<p>It has been an eventful first half of the year for municipal bonds. Despite challenges ranging from Puerto Rico&rsquo;s troubles to tax reform and the perpetual concern of rising interest rates, the municipal bond market has been strong. The sector has been aided by a strong technical position. Supply from new issuance has been down about 50% compared to last year, while maturities and calls have risen to elevated levels. In the second half of 2017, the market remains vulnerable to the repercussions of tax reform, if and when the details of the legislation are announced and finalized. From a credit perspective, generally, we continue to favor AA and AAA rated bonds at tighter spreads rather than reaching for yield in the A and BBB categories.  </p>
<h4>U.S. Equity  </h4>
<p>The stock market has generated strong gains in the first half of the year fueled by rising corporate earnings, expectations for an eventual increase in economic growth and improving conditions in many foreign economies. As we progress through the year, we expect the market to trend higher driven by a continuation of these trends. In fact, earnings are expected to grow by about 10% this year without the help of a tax cut. While stocks are expected to generate solid gains, returns may be tempered by valuations that are above average and a steady withdrawal of stimulus from the Federal Reserve.  </p>
<h4>International Equity </h4>
<p>International equities performed well in the first half of the year and for the first time since 2012 are on track to outperform U.S. stocks. The gains are justified as economies in many foreign countries have improved and economic growth rates are accelerating. In addition, the improved outlook has resulted in a declining U.S. dollar which has provided a nice tailwind to foreign stock returns. Despite the recent improvement in the outlook, valuations remain attractive and aggressive monetary policies continue to be employed in Europe and Japan. &nbsp;  </p>
<h4>Commodity  </h4>
<p>Commodity prices have been mixed this year. Within the commodity markets, each segment has provided modest gains or losses except for energy. Advances in technology are allowing for a sustained increase in U.S. production which has pushed the price of oil down approximately 14% this year. Looking forward, we expect commodity prices to stabilize and eventually to trend upward as the global economic expansion continues.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Potential Threats  </span></h5>
<p>Risks and Notable Items to Watch </p>
<h4>Rising Protectionist Sentiment </h4>
<p>Globally, there is rising protectionist sentiment that is fueling a backlash against free trade. While much of the rhetoric is likely a function of positioning for negotiating leverage, there is a risk that supply chains will be negatively impacted and costs for some goods will increase.   </p>
<h4>Geopolitical Risks </h4>
<p>Conflicts in many parts of the world have escalated. Events in Syria are critically important to monitor given Russia&rsquo;s support for the Syrian government. In North Korea, the government continues to develop and test ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations resolutions banning such tests. Just as important, the heightened tensions in the South China Sea also present some risk.  </p>
<h4>U.S./China Relations </h4>
<p>The new administration is taking a different approach in its relationship with China. Instead of focusing on threats emanating from China&rsquo;s long-term goals, the new administration is placing a stronger emphasis on trade and the loss of U.S. jobs. After their meetings earlier this year, there has been a change in tone between the leaders which is encouraging, as there appears to be an increased willingness to work together. Looking forward, we will be watching for meaningful actions that demonstrate the leaders&rsquo; intentions to follow through on their discussions. </p>
<h4>Debt Related Issues </h4>
<p>Sovereign debt levels continue to grow throughout much of the world, generating conditions associated with low rates of economic growth. In response to the low growth rates, there has been a meaningful shift in the willingness to use fiscal policy to stimulate these economies. However, if the initiatives are debt financed, they run the risk of exacerbating the issue and creating more significant problems in the long-term.</p>
<h4>Policy Risks </h4>
<p>The Federal Reserve has announced their intention to continue to raise interest rates and has expressed an interest in reducing the size of its balance sheet later this year. At the same time, central banks in other major economies are considering when to alter their policies to a more restrictive stance. If the world&rsquo;s central banks reduce stimulus too quickly, there is a heightened risk of slowing economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cybersecurity </h4>
<p>Cybersecurity is becoming a significant issue given persistent attacks on the international money transfer system, SWIFT, and on systemically important financial institutions.  </p>
<a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2017/06/15/fed-follows-through-hikes-rates-again" target="_blank"><img title="WantMoreOnMarketTrends_CTA" alt="WantMoreOnMarketTrends_CTA" src="https://www.badgley.com/images/default-source/Blog/wantmoreonmarkettrends_cta.png?sfvrsn=2" data-displaymode="Original" /></a>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 17:53:38 Zurn:uuid:56d9f344-abe9-6626-a8f8-ff0000ddfb2ahttps://www.badgley.com/blog/blog/2017/07/06/end-of-life-planning-considerations-as-you-and-your-loved-ones-age End of life planning: Considerations as you and your loved ones age<p>As financial planners, we know it&rsquo;s important to engage in end of life planning for yourself and your aging parents as early as possible. But as sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, we know it&rsquo;s not always an easy topic to bring up. That said, an awkward conversation now is better than the stress of trying to decode a family member&rsquo;s wishes while grieving over a loss. Following is a walkthrough of how to approach end of life planning &ndash; and what topics you should discuss now to help ease the burden later.<span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Hold a family meeting</span></h5>
<p>Instead of relying on one-off discussions between smaller groups, or worse, avoiding the conversation altogether, consider planning a family meeting that involves all family members at the same time. Questions raised by one family member could be shared by others, or prompt a discussion that might have otherwise been left unsaid.  </p>
<p>Here are some topics to start with:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Share and discuss family values and goals of individual family members</li>
    <li>Raise the issue of providing home health assistance, should it be necessary, and determine how it&rsquo;ll be handled</li>
    <li>Discuss how parents will maintain social relationships and activities</li>
    <li>Talk about expenses to cover end of life arrangements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to allocate enough time to allow the eldest members to share what&rsquo;s important to them and their goals and wishes so that everyone in the room has a clear understanding.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Name a personal representative </span></h5>
<p>The personal representative is the person responsible for managing the administration of a deceased individual&rsquo;s estate, also known as the estate executor or administrator. The duties of the personal representative include:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying and protecting estate assets</li>
    <li>Determining date-of-death valuations </li>
    <li>Managing creditor&rsquo;s claims of the estate</li>
    <li>Filing all appropriate pleadings with probate court </li>
    <li>Filing all the appropriate tax returns</li>
    <li>Distributing the estate assets </li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to discuss with your personal representative the designation of other financial surrogates, who can assist an aging client with financial matters. These could include: a Social Security representative payee, a long-term care insurance alternate payee, an agent for funeral decisions, the person who will receive Durable Power of Attorney and Healthcare Power of Attorney, and the person who has access to bank accounts. In some cases, the personal representative may also fulfill some or many of these roles.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Address administrative tasks  </span></h5>
<p>When considering end of life planning, organizing administrative tasks is of utmost importance. Here are several areas of focus:  </p>
<p><strong>Review the financial inventory </strong></p>
<p>Walk through the family member&rsquo;s financial inventory and make sure you know passwords to all accounts. It can be difficult and time consuming to gain access later.  </p>
<p><strong>Consider tax and portfolio implications </strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know what will happen with taxes and portfolios after death. An income tax return will need to be filed on behalf of the deceased. Estate taxes will need to be filed on behalf of the deceased&rsquo;s estate. And investment portfolios can be transferred easily to a beneficiary &ndash; as long as one is designated. </p>
<p><strong>Create, review or update critical documents </strong></p>
<p>Make sure the following documents are in place and up-to-date: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Durable Power of Attorney: person assigned to make financial decisions on your behalf in the event of your incapacity. </li>
    <li>Healthcare Power of Attorney: this person is empowered to make healthcare decisions on your behalf should you become incapacitated.</li>
    <li>Will/Trust: helps to ensure that property is passed according to an individual's wishes. Wills should bequeath property in the same way that other documents do, such as your retirement account or insurance policy. The will should also include guardianship designations for your minor children.</li>
    <li>Beneficiary designations: identifies who will receive your assets. Some assets, like retirement accounts, can pass along after death without being included in a will. </li>
    <li>Letter of Intent: outlines your wishes for your assets. </li>
</ul>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"> Near-death planning  </span></h5>
<p>When someone is close to death, there are a few measures that are important to ensure the smooth transition of assets. Your financial adviser should:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Scrutinize the investment portfolio for assets that have declined in value and determine if the capital loss should be realized</li>
    <li>Consider whether it makes sense to gift depreciated stock to a child or spouse before death &ndash; this is most effective if a parent is not required to file Form 706 (estate tax return)</li>
    <li>Review titling of investment accounts </li>
</ul>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Living wills </span></h5>
<p>People are living longer. Because of this, approximately 25 percent of all U.S. deaths occur in the long-term care setting, and this figure is projected to rise to 40 percent by the year 2040 (<a href="http://www.nursing.upenn.edu/ncth/transitional-care-model/">http://www.transitionalcare.info/</a>).  </p>
<p>Planning ahead and creating a living will reduces the confusion or disagreement about the choices you would want people to make on your behalf. For your personal representative or other designated financial surrogates, a living will helps them understand your thoughts in order to facilitate conversations with others about medical and end-of-life care, and financial transitions.  </p>
<p>When creating a living will:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Consider your values</li>
    <li>Discuss your wishes with your primary physician, family and friends</li>

<em><span style="font-size: 12px;">By <a href="https://www.badgley.com/people/paul-horng">Paul Horng</a></span></em></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve increased rates for the third time in six months on Wednesday, raising the federal funds rate to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. The hike was largely telegraphed and was accompanied with additional details on plans to shrink the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s balance sheet, perhaps as early as the fourth quarter of this year. The date of the hike coincided with the release of the Consumer Price Index which revealed a third consecutive month of weak inflation data.</p>
<p>If inflation continues to run below the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target, our central bank may have to adjust its monetary policy. In her press conference, Janet Yellen reiterated her belief that transitory factors were impacting inflation and expected these one-off factors to subside, but also noted that the Federal Reserve was &ldquo;monitoring inflation closely&rdquo;. While the Fed raised rates, investors placed more weight on the latest inflation report and promptly sent the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond lower, ending the day at 2.12%, the lowest level since mid-November.</p>
<p>While the date has not been set, additional guidance was provided around unwinding the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Once the process starts, a monthly maximum of $6 billion Treasuries and $4 billion mortgage backed securities would be allowed to mature. The cap will increase in three month intervals and would top out at $30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for mortgage backed securities. </p>
<p>In addition to the 25-basis point increase in the fed funds rate and guidance on the reduction of their balance sheet, the Federal Reserve presented its projections for future rate hikes and the U.S. economy. Fed officials modestly increased their estimate of 2017 GDP growth to 2.2% and the projection for this year&rsquo;s unemployment rate was lowered to 4.3%. In addition, the core inflation estimate for this year was lowered to 1.7% but the 2018 rate of 2.0% was left untouched. Finally, three rate hikes are expected in both 2017 and 2018, leaving one more increase for later this year.</p>
<p>This is a fluid situation and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policy may be impacted as new economic data is released. We will continue to monitor the environment closely to assess whether any future developments necessitate a change in investment strategy.

<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">How to allocate your investments among different types of accounts to potentially increase your after-tax return</span></h5>
<em>By <a href="https://www.badgley.com/people/jeff-walters">Jeff Walters</a><br />
<br />
</em>
<p>The goal of every investment should be to maximize your return after all costs and taxes for a given level of risk. After all, the amount left after taxes and other fees is the money that you will be able to use to fund your financial goals. Here we will explore the concept of asset location as a way to mitigate the effect of taxes on your returns. Fees and other costs may also reduce your portfolio&rsquo;s return and should be considered when making decisions regarding your investments and the types of accounts that hold them. However, fees and costs are beyond the scope of this analysis.   </p>
<p>Many investors underestimate the impact of taxes on their portfolio&rsquo;s performance. According to Morningstar, over time the average equity mutual fund return is reduced by 1 &ndash; 1.2% per year due to taxes (see the illustration below). By reducing this annual &ldquo;tax drag&rdquo; you can increase your after-tax rate of return over time. </p>
<h3>Growth of $10,000 over 30 years</h3>
<p><img data-displaymode="Original" src="https://www.badgley.com/images/default-source/Blog/taxstrategiesforinvestors_taxdrag30yr2016.png?sfvrsn=2" alt="TaxStrategiesForInvestors_TaxDrag30Yr2016" title="TaxStrategiesForInvestors_TaxDrag30Yr2016" /></p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean you should neglect the pre-tax return, or let the &ldquo;tax tail&rdquo; wag the &ldquo;investment dog.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s most important to select appropriate investments that support your objectives and address your risk tolerance to begin with. <br />
<br />
Let&rsquo;s assume that you have worked with an adviser to determine your optimal asset allocation. With the asset allocation set to fund your financial goals, taxable investors should consider applying the concept of asset location as an extension of their asset allocation strategy to reduce the &ldquo;tax drag&rdquo; on their portfolios. </p>
<p>The concept of asset location is based upon the recognition that certain investment accounts (IRAs, Roth IRAs, regular taxable portfolios, etc.) will be more or less efficient for certain types of investments because of the taxability of the type of investment accounts along with the tax treatment of the investments held in those accounts. To apply an asset location strategy to your portfolio, you select which assets should be in your taxable accounts and which to place in your tax-advantaged accounts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 20px; color: #0070c0;">In general, you want to put tax-efficient investments into taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments into tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth) accounts.</span></p>
<p>It is important to note that not all investors need to be concerned with asset location. If all of your investments may be held in tax-advantaged accounts, this strategy will not be necessary.
</p>
<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">How are different types of investments taxed? </span></h5>
<p>To evaluate the tax efficiency of your investments, it is essential to know that different types of investment income are treated differently by the IRS. In general, income from taxable bonds, CDs, savings accounts, REITs, private businesses, preferred stock, and limited partnerships are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. The top rate in 2017 is currently 39.6% for taxpayers filing jointly and earning more than $470,700. Conversely qualified dividends from most common stocks and gains from selling an investment you&rsquo;ve owned over a year are taxed at a lower capital gains tax rate of 0 &ndash; 20% depending on your tax bracket.     </p>
<h3>2017 Federal Income Tax Brackets</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12px;"><em></em></span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em><img src="https://www.badgley.com/images/default-source/Blog/irs_table.png?sfvrsn=6&amp;MaxWidth=436&amp;MaxHeight=&amp;ScaleUp=false&amp;Quality=High&amp;Method=ResizeFitToAreaArguments&amp;Signature=4B5373C9EE55EFF897B6A4B695A05CE2E2D7AD75" data-displaymode="Custom" alt="IRS_Table" title="IRS_Table" data-method="ResizeFitToAreaArguments" data-customsizemethodproperties="{'MaxWidth':'436','MaxHeight':'','ScaleUp':false,'Quality':'High'}" /></em></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px;"><em><br />
</em></span>
<p>Also, for investors earning over $250,000 and filing jointly there is an additional 3.8% tax on most investment income, which brings the top marginal rates to 43.4% and 23.8%, respectively. Finally, interest income from municipal bonds is generally tax-free. </p>
<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">Which investments are tax-efficient and which are not? </span></h5>
<p>The income and growth from tax-efficient investments will usually qualify for a more favorable capital gains treatment or will not be taxed at all in the case of municipal bond interest. Municipal bonds, common stocks, most equity index funds and ETFs are examples of tax-efficient investments. </p>
<p> Examples of tax-inefficient investments include taxable bonds, high dividend yielding stocks, many partnerships or partnership-like investments (LPs, REITS, etc.), most actively managed mutual funds, and any strategy which involves a high level of turnover. The most tax-inefficient investments are those that produce a lot of current income or that incur short term capital gains &ndash; both taxed at the less favorable ordinary income tax rate. </p>
<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">Where should I place my different investments? </span></h5>
<p>Placing the most tax-inefficient investments in an account that is tax-deferred such as an IRA or your company 401k will give you the most bang for your buck. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, grows tax free, is not subject to required distributions at age 70 &frac12; and distributions from the account are tax-free. Because of these advantages, holding tax-inefficient investments that also have a relatively high expected return in your Roth IRA is a good strategy. The more tax-efficient investments can be placed in a taxable account. </p>
<p> In practice, asset location is usually not an exact science. Tax-deferred and tax-free (Roth) accounts will have contribution limits, tax rates and your tax bracket will change over time, and your investment mix will also change. Additionally, tax-deferred and tax-free accounts will generally have early withdrawal penalties so this strategy would typically not be used with funds that you need prior to age 59 &frac12;. It is also difficult to move funds between the different types of investment accounts. <br />

<p>While there are few really hard and fast rules, the following chart may be used as a guide in applying an asset location strategy to your portfolio. </p>

<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">A note on international investments </span></h5>
<p>While generally it makes sense to treat international investments the same in terms of asset location, there may be a slight advantage to holding them in a taxable account due to the foreign tax credit. The foreign tax credit can&rsquo;t be used in an IRA or Roth IRA, so by having your investment there you&rsquo;re essentially &ldquo;losing&rdquo; the credit.&nbsp; However, this credit is typically small and may be outweighed by other factors.  </p>
<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">A simple example </span></h5>
<p>Joanne is a high earning professional with a total portfolio of $1,000,000 consisting of a $300,000 SEP IRA and a $700,000 taxable brokerage account. Let&rsquo;s assume that the asset allocation per her financial plan is 50% Stocks, 40% Bonds, and 10% Alternatives (REITs). Based on the asset location principles, and assuming the stocks are mostly individual stocks and tax-efficient ETFs, Joanne would allocate all $100k of the REITs and $200k of the bonds to her SEP IRA. She would allocate all the stocks and the balance of the bonds to her taxable account. Depending on her tax bracket the taxable account may hold municipal bonds instead of corporate bonds. </p>
<h5><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">An adviser can help </span></h5>
<p>As stated previously, asset location is not an exact science. Furthermore, every investor&rsquo;s situation is different so there is no one-size-fits-all approach in determining where to place your investments. Your individual situation will vary depending on many factors including liquidity needs, tax planning and estate planning. We recommend implementing this strategy in the context of an overall financial plan with the advice of a trusted adviser. </p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin once wrote &ldquo;In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.&rdquo; You cannot control tax legislation or the markets. However, careful consideration of an asset location strategy will help you reduce the potential tax impact on your long-term wealth. We&rsquo;re here to help even when it comes to location, location, location.  <br />

</em></span></p>
<p>According to BizBuySell, an online marketplace, 6 in 10 small business owners in the U.S. plan to sell their businesses over the next decade. Many of these owners are baby boomers looking toward retirement. But retiring as a small business owner isn&rsquo;t the same as retiring as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/06/24/retirement-planning-101-this-is-not-your-grandparents-retirement">traditional employee</a> working for a large firm with a 401(k) plan. Successful small business owners have a unique set of opportunities and challenges when it comes to retirement planning.  </p>
<p>Here are steps we encourage small business owner clients to consider a few years before the sale: </p>
<h4>Develop a financial plan </h4>
<p>In a financial plan, you can articulate your goals of what a successful retirement looks like for you. How much will your lifestyle cost? Where will you live? Who do you want to spend time with? What hobbies, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/11/18/give-a-little-bit-charitable-gifts-and-when-to-make-them">charitable endeavors</a> or even work do you want to pursue? It&rsquo;s important to take both the financial and non-financial factors into account. It&rsquo;s a big change to go from working in your business every day to suddenly giving up control to someone else. I&rsquo;ve noticed that clients who think these things through in advance are, on average, more satisfied in retirement than those who only focus on the financial aspects of the sale of their business. </p>
<h4>Align your business goals with your personal goals </h4>
<p>Once you know what your ideal retirement looks like, you can begin to align the goals of your business and its ultimate sale with that in mind. Are you hoping to transition the business to your son or daughter? Or to a key employee? What will that look like financially and how may that affect your retirement vs. a sale on the open market? </p>
<p>This is the point where you should consider engaging a consultant or business broker who specializes in your industry. The price that a business will sell for varies wildly across industry, structure and size of the business. A good, competent consultant can help you make a realistic assessment of the value of your business for an internal or external sale. </p>
<h4>Max out any available retirement plans </h4>
<p>Now is a good time to make sure you are deferring as much income as possible into your company retirement plans. As a business owner, you have a broad selection of tax-deferred investment vehicles such as SEP IRAs, Simple IRAs and 401(k)s. Which one makes the most sense for you will depend on how much you can set aside, how many employees you have and the structure of your firm. Your financial planner can help you decide what makes the most sense. If you have been counting on just the business value to fund your retirement or haven&rsquo;t set up a retirement plan, now is a great time to get started. </p>
<h4>Determine the tax impact of selling </h4>
<p>Once you are ready to sell, consider sitting down with a CPA to discuss the tax implications of different ways the sale can be structured. Depending on how the sale is set up, you may pay ordinary income tax, a lower capital gains tax or a combination of the two. This will likely be a negotiating point when you get to the sale itself, since a tax benefit for you is oftentimes a tax cost for the other party. The more educated you are going into the sale negotiation, the better the outcome. </p>
<h4>Make sure your post-sale insurance needs are covered </h4>
<p>One aspect of the sale that sometimes gets overlooked is insurance. While you owned the business, you may have had a health care plan in place through the company that may go away after the sale. Depending on your age, now is the time to consider Medicare supplement options, the individual health care market or the ACA exchanges. Also, you may have insurance you&rsquo;ll no longer need, such as an extra liability policy related to the business, or an individual disability policy tied to your income from the business. If you are selling to a family member, you might want to consider a life insurance policy for the benefit of other heirs that won&rsquo;t be taking over the business. </p>
<h4>Consider your legacy </h4>
<p>Prior to the sale is also a good time to think about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/08/15/the-state-of-your-estate-three-things-you-should-know-about-estate-planning">estate planning</a>. You may be facing a windfall from selling your business so now is a good time to update your will. If you&rsquo;re doing an internal sale to a family member, you may want to think about the legacy you want to leave to other family members as well. Finally, this is a good time to think about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/11/18/give-a-little-bit-charitable-gifts-and-when-to-make-them">charitable endeavors</a>; a gift made the year of the sale could be coordinated to reduce your tax liability.&nbsp; </p>
<p> With good planning, a sound retirement is within reach for the small business owner. Developing a financial plan that aligns your personal and business goals will be critical. It will help you carefully consider the unique opportunities and challenges of the small business owner as you plan your exit strategy. It is possible to successfully retire your small business so you can do the same. </p>

<h4>Economy </h4>
<p>The U.S. economy continues to grow at a modest pace.&nbsp;Consistent with the trend of the last few years, the economy appears to have been relatively soft in the first quarter, but we expect the expansion to continue and the pace of growth to increase as we progress through the year.&nbsp;In fact, the pace of the expansion may accelerate if the administration can execute their plan to reduce government regulations and cut taxes.&nbsp;Given their expectations for an acceleration in the rate of growth and rising inflation, our central bank has provided guidance that there will be two more rate hikes this year.  </p>
<h4>Inflation </h4>
<p>Inflation remains low, but it has been climbing steadily over the last couple of years.&nbsp;In fact, it is too early to say definitively, but we may be shifting from an environment of deflation to one of reflation.&nbsp;The Consumer Price Index, a widely-followed inflation gauge, hovered around zero in 2015, averaged about 1% last year and climbed to 2.7% in the early stages of 2017.&nbsp;Looking forward, we expect inflation to continue to rise, but at a much slower pace, given the increase in the price of energy, rising wages, the agenda of the new administration in the U.S. and a gradual shift away from negative interest rate policies in Europe and Japan.   </p>
<h4>U.S. dollar </h4>
<p>The U.S. dollar declined in the first quarter, but remains close to its recent high given expectations for additional rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and the new administration&rsquo;s economic platform.&nbsp;In the coming months, we expect the dollar to remain elevated as President Trump attempts to implement his agenda and foreign economies remain somewhat soft.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Asset class  </span></h5>
<h4>Cash/money market instruments </h4>
<p>Yields on money market instruments have increased given two rate hikes since the middle of December, expectations for two additional hikes later this year and the potential for a reduction in the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s balance sheet before the end of 2017.&nbsp;In addition, economic data has generally been positive, yet continues to remain measured, and inflation, which has also been increasing, has not displayed an upward jolt.&nbsp;Given this backdrop, there is an upward bias for yields on money market instruments, but with the constraints on the economy tied to aging demographics and low productivity, we believe the path will remain gradual and relatively shallow.&nbsp;   </p>
<h4>Intermediate government/credit bonds </h4>
<p>The excitement tied to positive global economic data and optimism related to the new administration&rsquo;s pro-growth agenda has moderated in the early stages of 2017.&nbsp;Most of the economic data has remained positive, yet the high expectations related to inflation and fiscal policy have become more measured and, as a result, the credit market has been range bound.&nbsp;Spreads and yields for taxable bonds remain largely unchanged as record corporate bond issuance was met by strong inflows and is bolstered by expectations for solid earnings growth. In addition to rate hikes, the Federal Reserve has begun discussions on reduction of its agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) and U.S. Treasury holdings as soon as the latter part of this year.&nbsp;For the balance of 2017 there is an expectation of two, or possibly three, more interest rate hikes as well as measures to reduce the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.&nbsp;Investment grade corporate bonds remain our preference in the taxable bond universe due to the additional yield over Treasuries.  </p>
<h4>Tax-exempt municipal bonds </h4>
<p>Municipal bonds are off to a good start in 2017 but continue to face ongoing challenges from the Federal Reserve, Washington, D.C. and the oft mentioned underfunded pensions. While we will likely witness moderately higher rates from the Federal Reserve, the outlook from Washington, D.C. remains less clear owing to the shadow of tax reform. The tax reform discussions to date have centered on reducing tax rates, but many municipal investors are concerned over possible changes to the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds. We will be closely monitoring the tax-reform discussions but do not expect them to negatively impact the market in the second quarter. From a risk management perspective, our primary focus will remain on credits with significant unfunded pension obligations. Finally, tax-exempt bonds remain fairly valued versus other fixed income sectors, and our preference remains with revenue bonds over general obligation bonds though we have pared back our overweight.  </p>
<h4>U.S. equity  </h4>
<p>The stock market rallied in the first quarter fueled by rising corporate earnings, expectations for an eventual increase in economic growth and improving conditions in a number of foreign economies.&nbsp;As we progress through the year, we expect the market to trend higher driven by a continuation of these trends.&nbsp;Earnings declined in 2015 and throughout much of 2016, but should continue to rebound as the economy expands and the price of oil stabilizes.&nbsp;Corporate tax cuts, if implemented, should also provide a boost to profits as the savings on the reduced tax will fall right to the bottom line. While stocks are expected to provide solid gains, returns may be tempered by valuations that are above average.&nbsp;We also expect volatility to increase as the new administration attempts to implement its agenda.&nbsp;   </p>
<h4>International equity </h4>
<p>The economies in many foreign countries have improved and economic growth rates are accelerating.&nbsp;Despite the recent improvement in the outlook, aggressive monetary policies continue to be employed in Europe and Japan.&nbsp;Regarding the equity markets, valuations remain attractive as the fundamentals are improving and performance has been modest in recent years.&nbsp;Given the strong actions by these governments and attractive valuations, international stocks are compelling.&nbsp;However, we expect these markets to be volatile due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, elections in France and Germany, an undercapitalized banking system in Europe and excessive debt levels in some countries.   </p>
<h4>Commodity  </h4>
<p>After declining dramatically in recent years, commodity prices have rebounded from their lows.&nbsp;Oil and industrial metals increased significantly last year.&nbsp;A decline in U.S. oil production growth, along with OPEC&rsquo;s agreement to cut supply, resulted in a reversal in oil prices after a steady drop that started in June of 2014.&nbsp;Metals prices increased given an expected acceleration in economic growth and rising demand from China.&nbsp;Looking forward, we expect prices to remain volatile, but to trend upward as the global economic expansion continues.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Potential threats  </span></h5>
<p>Risks and notable items to watch</p>
<p>  </p>
<h4>Rising protectionist sentiment </h4>
<p>Globally, there is rising protectionist sentiment that is fueling a backlash against free trade.&nbsp;While much of the rhetoric is likely a function of positioning for negotiating leverage, there is a risk that supply chains will be negatively impacted and costs for some goods will increase.   </p>
<h4>Geopolitical risks </h4>
<p>Conflicts in many parts of the world have escalated.&nbsp;Events in Syria are critically important to monitor given Russia&rsquo;s support for the Syrian government.&nbsp;In North Korea, the government continues to develop and test ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations resolutions banning such tests. Just as important, the heightened tensions in the South China Sea also present some risk. </p>
<h4>U.S./China relations</h4>
<p>The new administration is taking a different approach in its relationship with China.&nbsp;Instead of focusing on threats emanating from China&rsquo;s long-term goals, the new administration is placing a stronger emphasis on trade and the loss of U.S. jobs.&nbsp;After their recent meeting, there has been a change in tone between the leaders which is encouraging, as there appears to be an increased willingness to work together. Looking forward, we will be watching for meaningful actions that demonstrate the leaders&rsquo; intentions to follow through on their recent discussions. &nbsp; </p>
<h4> Debt-related issues </h4>
<p>Sovereign debt levels continue to grow throughout much of the world, generating conditions associated with low rates of economic growth. In response to the low growth rates, there has been a meaningful shift in the willingness to use fiscal policy to stimulate these economies. However, if the initiatives are debt financed, they run the risk of exacerbating the issue and creating more significant problems in the long-term.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>  Policy risks </h4>
<p>Asset prices in the U.S. are currently reflecting expectations of at least a modest amount of corporate tax reform and regulatory relief. A disappointing outcome in the Trump administration&rsquo;s efforts could lead to downward revisions in future earnings growth.&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve has announced their intention to continue to raise interest rates and has expressed an interest in reducing the size of its balance sheet later this year. If the central bank acts on either of these fronts too rapidly, there is a heightened risk of slowing economic growth.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
<p>Cybersecurity is becoming a significant issue given persistent attacks on the international money transfer system, SWIFT, and on systemically important financial institutions.  <br />

</span></em>Studies suggest that habits <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/school-thought/201502/study-finds-habits-in-children-take-root-age-9" target="_blank">take root</a> in children as young as age nine. Creating positive saving and spending habits in your children will help set them up for better financial fitness over their lifetimes. Here are some ways you can teach your children standards for personal finance, no matter whether they&rsquo;re just starting school or moving out of the house.<em><span style="font-size: 12px;"><br />
</span></em></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Ages 5 - 8</span></h5>
<p>With younger children, you can begin teaching the fundamentals of personal income and of developing a plan for <strong>saving, spending</strong> and <strong>donating</strong>.  </p>
<p>Start with a small allowance that is easily divided into thirds to teach children how to allocate responsibly between these three &ldquo;buckets.&rdquo; Offer one-off household tasks as additional opportunities for your child to earn money.  </p>
<p>Demonstrate <strong>spending</strong> by allowing your child to trade money for something else he or she wants, like a treat. Talk to your child about times you have opted not to spend money on something, and why. Discuss the difference between borrowing something and buying something &ndash; and explain that something borrowed must be returned.  </p>
<p>Build a foundation for <strong>saving</strong> by identifying a savings goal that you can experience together, like a ticket to a movie or the zoo. Add the experience date to the family calendar and track progress weekly. Take a trip to your bank and let your children deposit money into their own savings account, and talk to them about the types of things you&rsquo;re saving for yourself. Have the bank mail statements to your children. Receiving mail will be exciting and it&rsquo;s a convenient reminder to take a moment with your children to review their account and the interest they earned. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Introduce <strong>donating</strong> by helping your child research different charitable organizations and identify which one(s) appeal to him or her, then following through on the donation.  </p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a gift-receiving opportunity like a holiday or birthday and kids are asked for gift ideas, discuss appropriate price ranges and why that matters. Discuss how a gift from a grandparent may be a different price range than a gift from a school friend.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Ages 9 - 12</span></h5>
<p>With your older elementary and early middle school aged children, focus on expanding their personal finance vocabulary to the concepts of borrowing and lending, and on building their knowledge of responsibilities associated with financial decisions.  </p>
<p>Raise your child&rsquo;s allowance as he or she gets older and identify jobs kids can do on a regular basis around the house to earn money. Discuss that with more financial reward comes greater responsibility. </p>
<p>Encourage your child to begin to track his or her spending and saving; there are many online resources and apps that can help.  </p>
<p>Demonstrate <strong>responsibility</strong> associated with financial decisions by discussing how saving money can improve financial and personal well-being. Predict the financial and personal outcomes of different spending decisions, such as using all of one&rsquo;s spending money on candy versus saving up for a month to buy a new video game versus saving for six months to buy a special teacher an end-of-year gift.  </p>
<p>Talk about practical money-handling situations like keeping track of cash sent from a relative in a birthday card or discussing how to best keep track of lunch money after the school bell rings.  </p>
<p>Make real the concept of <strong>borrowing and lending</strong> by allowing your child to have money for something he or she wants, with the understanding that he/she will pay you back over time. Mark the dates payments are required on the family calendar. Discuss how financial institutions lend money in this manner to borrowers who must pay it back.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Ages 13 - 17</span></h5>
<p>Older kids are ready to learn about expanded financial concepts like alternate sources of income, creating a financial plan, credit, philanthropy and evolving financial responsibilities. Soon, they will leave home and be expected to manage their finances independently, so now it is crucial to make sure they&rsquo;re armed with the knowledge they&rsquo;ll need.
</p>
<p>Beginning in late middle school, introduce the concept of the <strong>different types of income</strong>. Talk about how unearned income, like interest, investment income and dividends, is different from earned income such as compensation, tips or self-employment income.  </p>
<p>Explain employee benefits &ndash; even sharing your company&rsquo;s employee handbook with your child &ndash; and talk about the tangible and intangible value of these benefits.  </p>
<p>Create a <strong>detailed plan</strong> with your child to manage his or her saving, donating and spending goals. Talk about ensuring that his/her goals are in line with his/her values. Discuss how changes in spending habits can contribute to financial stability over the long haul, illustrating how both monetary assets, like cash, and nonmonetary assets, like property, contribute to net worth. Explain the concept of inflation and how it can impact spending power over time.  </p>
<p>Talk about how the government helps low-income, disabled or elderly people who have financial need. Show how <strong>financial contributions</strong> to nonprofits help the contributor as well as the recipient. Spend some time with your child discussing how his/her financial decisions can help others.  </p>
<p>Teach your child about <strong>credit</strong>, explaining how credit cards are different from debit cards &ndash; and how interest rates, borrower grace periods and fees can affect credit card debt. Talk about different situations in which one might evaluate whether or not to use credit and compare the costs of borrowing different sums ($500 vs. $1,000 vs. $5,000) from different consumer credit sources.  </p>
<p>Research together the different types of college costs and how taking out student loans can impact family financials. Help your child build a realistic budget for his/her freshman year in college. </p>
<p>Also, discuss age-appropriate money handling and spending topics, like combatting peer pressure, keeping track of cash and spending, and how <strong>financial responsibility changes</strong> with age, starting a family and other life changing circumstances.&nbsp;   </p>
<p>No matter the age of your child, don&rsquo;t create money anxiety by saying, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford that.&rdquo; Instead, tell your child, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how our family chooses to spend money,&rdquo; or &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a priority for our family right now.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Perhaps the single most important takeaway on the path to arming your child with personal finance standards is to maintain open communication. Share your own experiences &ndash; both the sound decisions and the mistakes &ndash; so that your child feels confident about asking questions or sharing concerns now and in the longer term. Modeling sound financial fitness for your children will help ensure that your family&rsquo;s values will survive generations and be woven into your family&rsquo;s legacy.  </p>

March 21, 2017</em></span> </p>
<p>Stocks have moved higher since November&rsquo;s election, in part due to the anticipation of corporate tax reform. Changes in the tax code could have a significant impact on earnings and some industry estimates indicate that reform, in the aggregate, may boost earnings by more than 5%. However, there will be winners and losers depending on the contents of the final tax bill. Presently, there are several proposals, but common elements include meaningful reductions in both the federal tax rate and the tax on cash repatriated from profits generated in foreign countries. Immediate deductions of capital expenditures are also under consideration.  </p>
<p>While there are many proponents of corporate tax reform, there is also a strong voice within Congress calling for these changes to be revenue neutral. Our government debt is already at a high level and there is a sizeable contingent that wants tax reform with no increase in our debt burden. To pay for the tax cuts, current recommendations include a border tax adjustment and the elimination of certain deductions. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">How will the tax cut affect company earnings? </span></h5>
<p>President Trump has called for a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15%. However, House Republicans are currently moving forward with a plan to reduce it to 20%, which is more palatable to those who want to avoid a significant increase in the budget deficit. Both plans will generate a meaningful tax cut for many companies. We estimate that the weighted average effective tax rate for S&amp;P 500 companies was approximately 27.5% over the last 4 quarters. A cut to 20%, without any other changes, will result in a 10% increase in earnings for the S&amp;P 500 Index and will reduce the forward P/E of the S&amp;P 500 from 18x to 16x. </p>

</span></em></p>
<strong> </strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Which companies will benefit most? </span></h5>
<p>While the proposed tax cuts will lower overall taxes in aggregate, the benefits and costs of the proposed reforms will not be evenly distributed across sectors, industries and companies.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>A reduction in the tax rate will provide the greatest benefit to sectors with the fewest exclusions, deductions and offsets. In other words, those companies with high effective tax rates will accrue a large portion of the savings. This group of companies includes those in the industrials, telecommunication and consumer discretionary sectors. In contrast, sectors such as real estate, energy and health care have low effective tax rates and will benefit the least. There is also a proposal to allow companies to immediately deduct their capital expenditures. An immediate deduction, as opposed to depreciating the cost over the life of the acquired asset, provides a tax incentive to invest a higher portion of current profits towards future growth. In doing so, companies will lower their tax payments to the government and increase after-tax profitability. This policy will likely accelerate company timelines for capital purchases in the coming years and may help to boost economic growth. Primary beneficiaries of this policy include capital intensive businesses such as domestic manufacturers.  </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img title="CorporateTaxRateDataCharts_2" alt="CorporateTaxRateDataCharts_2" data-displaymode="Original" src="https://www.badgley.com/images/default-source/Blog/corporatetaxratedatacharts_2.png?sfvrsn=1" /></strong><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Source: Bloomberg </em></span></p>
<p>There will also be an impact from the changes designed to make up for lost revenue from lower tax rates. Proposals include the implementation of a border adjustment tax, elimination of the deduction for interest expense and encouraging repatriation of foreign cash reserves by lowering tax rates. These revenue generators will play a major role in determining which sectors and industries benefit from corporate tax reform. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">What sectors of the economy will be most affected by a border tax? </span></h5>
<p>The proposed border adjustment tax will eliminate the tax deduction for imported goods and implement a tax deduction for exports. For companies with import costs that represent a significant amount of their expenses, the border tax will boost their tax bill and reduce their net income. Retailers and consumer goods companies will be especially hard hit, as many of these companies import a large portion of their inventory from abroad. Without any change in the value of the U.S. dollar, many consumer goods companies will see their taxes rise and will have to increase prices to maintain current profitability levels. Thus, critics have argued that a border adjustment tax will make many retailers uncompetitive while also boosting inflation as prices of consumer goods rise.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Advocates of the proposal argue that these negatives will be offset by a rise in the U.S. dollar and the tax deduction received on exports. Companies that export their products will receive a significant reduction in their tax expense and will be poised to use the savings to boost production as well as hire more American workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Given the potential impact on stakeholders, some Senate Republicans have said they are against the border adjustment tax. This will make it difficult for House Republicans to include the tax as a part of the reform and reduces the risk that a border adjustment tax will be implemented. If the border adjustment tax isn&rsquo;t included in the tax bill and the emphasis on a revenue neutral plan remains intact, Congress will likely have to find another way to either make up for lost revenue, adopt a less significant tax cut, or some combination of these two solutions.&nbsp;  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Will the elimination of interest deductibility change how companies allocate their capital? </span></h5>
<p>The ability to deduct interest expense adds to the attractiveness of debt compared to equity, because income that flows to equity holders is taxed. Even without tax deductibility, debt carries a lower required return than equity due to the debt holder&rsquo;s right to claim assets of a bankrupt company before equity owners. Because of this, debt will still have a place in company capital allocation; however, companies will likely reduce their leverage, on average, because it will be comparatively less attractive in the capital structure without a tax advantage. Companies with the highest tax rates and leverage stand to lose the most from this elimination, such as those in the telecommunications and utilities sectors. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">What is likely to happen with overseas cash repatriations? </span></h5>
<p>If companies are allowed to repatriate cash into the U.S. under favorable tax terms, they will likely use that cash to either make shareholder distributions or fund potential acquisitions. Capital expenditures will also be under consideration but they take longer to plan and implement than a simple stock repurchase. Companies can have a more immediate effect on their stock value by simply repurchasing shares. Regardless, cash repatriation provides a significant opportunity to return cash to shareholders or invest in profitable projects, which should help to boost stock prices. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Will changes to the corporate tax code impact my portfolio? </span></h5>
<p>Changes in the corporate tax code are expected to lower corporate taxes overall, which should provide a boost to total company earnings and stock prices. However, under the current proposals there are likely to be winners and losers. Assuming all aspects under consideration are adopted, the impact on an individual stock will be dependent upon its tax rate, the degree to which they import basic materials and export finished goods, the extent of foreign sales, their capital structure and the capital intensiveness of the business. While it is still early in the process, we are looking for opportunities to take advantage of the changing tax code and have incorporated that in our analytical framework. As time passes and the final reform bill takes shape we will look to reposition, as necessary, for what could be a shifting economic landscape.<br />

<p>With the FOMC, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s monetary policymaking body, meeting today and tomorrow, it&rsquo;s timely to preview the potential outcomes.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>This FOMC meeting will be closely followed given the potential for a change in interest rates. In addition, Janet Yellen will hold a press conference after the meeting and the committee will publish updated economic projections. The latest data point from the nonfarm payroll report, combined with guidance from recent speeches by key Federal Reserve policymakers, has largely cemented a 25-basis point rate hike on Wednesday. Additionally, given the proximity to achieving the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s dual mandate, there is an upward bias to the projection for the number of rate hikes in 2017. At this meeting the committee may raise their forecast to four rate hikes this year from the previous guidance of three. Continued solid economic growth could also result in the Federal Reserve beginning to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year. </p>
<p> After passing the eight-year anniversary of the economic recovery last week, the slow but steady expansion is now the third longest on record. Despite its long duration, the expansion remains well entrenched. For example, last Friday&rsquo;s nonfarm payroll report was strong; 235,000 new jobs were added during the month of February while unemployment ticked down from 4.8% to 4.7%. Average hourly earnings also increased 2.8% year over year, a modest improvement over an upwardly revised January rate of 2.6%.  </p>
<p>The addition of 235,000 new jobs in February compares favorably to last year&rsquo;s average monthly gain of 187,000. While the expansion is firmly intact, unseasonably warm weather helped to boost job growth last month. February 2017 was the second warmest February on record for the lower 48 and helped to accelerate construction activity which pulled forward 58,000 new jobs from future months. Despite the boost from warmer weather, many other economic data points confirm that the expansion is intact and there is a significant chance for growth to accelerate from current levels.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>At this juncture, it appears that the Federal Reserve may have the confidence to raise interest rates between three and four times this year. The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s dual mandate requires an emphasis on price stability and maximizing employment, both of which have largely been achieved. The unemployment rate of 4.7% is close to the 4.4% rate posted during the halcyon days of late 2006. Headline PCE inflation of 1.9% is also close to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target of 2.0% and is the highest in over four years. These factors, combined with affirming economic data points, raise the probability that we will see an increase in the pace of rate hikes this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>While the pace of hikes is expected to quicken in 2017, we continue to believe that the Federal Reserve will remain data dependent and that secular issues, such as high government debt levels, will continue to act as a headwind. Growth rates may increase, but not to such a degree that the Federal Reserve is forced to rapidly raise interest rates at a single meeting. Instead, we expect a gradual progression of higher rates as economic growth improves. </p>

Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) like Badgley Phelps are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and overseen by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The 1940 Act requires an RIA like Badgley Phelps to adopt and implement codes of conduct to, for instance, eliminate as many conflicts of interest as possible, disclose any remaining conflicts, and be a fiduciary when giving you financial advice.   </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Registered investment advisers vs. brokers</span></h5>
<p>By contrast, broker-dealers and their registered representatives are regulated primarily by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, which is a self-regulatory body made up of and funded by brokerage firms. Due to an exception in the 1940 Act, broker-dealers are exempt from the fiduciary standard. Instead, brokers operate under the suitability standard which requires that their recommendations be suitable for a client but not necessarily in the client&rsquo;s best interest. For example, the suitability standard allows a higher-commission investment product to be sold when the same or similar product is available at a lower-commission. </p>
<p>Investment professionals can also go by a variety of different titles including wealth adviser, financial adviser, and investment consultant. There is little regulation on which title an investment professional can use. For example, someone with the title of &ldquo;Financial Adviser&rdquo; could be a Registered Investment Adviser operating under a fiduciary duty or a registered representative of a broker-dealer only subject to a suitability standard, making it difficult for the investing public to distinguish between the two. The important distinction here is that a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) is subject to a fiduciary duty whereas a broker-dealer is not. To assist the public, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has provided a <a target="_blank" href="https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Default.aspx">searchable database</a> for investors to determine if an adviser is a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA).
</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Switching hats with dual registration</span></h5>
<p>Today, many financial advisers serve as both investment advisers and brokers - estimates are that greater than 75% of all registered investment adviser representatives are also registered brokers. In addition, there are designations, such as the Certified Financial Planner&trade; professional or CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> certificant, which require its members to act as fiduciaries during a financial planning engagement. However, a dually registered CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> certificant that is also a broker-dealer can still &ldquo;switch hats&rdquo; and give non-fiduciary advice regarding investment products that fall outside the financial planning engagement. In this situation, the adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary responsibility is limited and depends on which hat they are wearing when advising you. Yes, it can be confusing. The key to making sure you&rsquo;re getting unbiased advice is to know that your adviser is a fiduciary and advising you in a fiduciary capacity. </p>
<p>A new rule from the Department of Labor (DOL) requires that any professional giving advice on retirement assets (401ks, IRAs, etc.) act as a fiduciary for those accounts regardless of their registration status. As of this writing, the original effective date of April 10, 2017 has been extended by sixty days and the implementation of this new rule is unclear.  </p>
<p>At Badgley Phelps we think all clients should receive objective, unbiased advice delivered by a competent wealth manager who is required to put the client&rsquo;s interests ahead of their own.   </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">How do I know if my adviser is a fiduciary? </span></h5>
<p>Here are some questions to ask your current or prospective adviser: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Do you act as a fiduciary when you are giving me investment advice?</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Default.aspx">Are you registered as an Investment Adviser or Investment Adviser Representative under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940?</a></li>
    <li>If so, are you also registered as a registered representative with FINRA?</li>
    <li>How are you compensated? Do you receive payments from the investment and/or insurance product companies that you recommend?</li>
    <li>Are you paid the same regardless of which investments you recommend, or could you be paid differently depending on my investments?</li>
    <li>What changes are you making related to the upcoming DOL rule? </li>

In fact, Ernst &amp; Young&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/transactions/ey-capital-confidence-barometer?gclid=Cj0KEQiAqdLDBRDD-b2sv6-i6MsBEiQAkT3wAvtGaeB_fHq25bJoco4rMjMCP0pDwgmjx_rzsSMXp6saAvoU8P8HAQ" target="_blank">Global Capital Confidence Barometer</a> reports that 57 percent of executives expect to actively pursue acquisitions in the next 12 months and 49 percent of companies have more than five deals in their pipeline. As T-Mobile, Netflix, Sears, Barnes &amp; Noble and many others are being <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/15/mergers-acquisitions-companies-2017-prediction/" target="_blank">eyed for acquisition</a>, it&rsquo;s a good time to revisit why companies merge or acquire other companies &ndash; and the implications that M&amp;A activity at your company can have on shareholders and employees. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"> Why do companies engage in M&amp;A?  </span></h5>
<p>While there can be tax advantages to acquiring a smaller company &ndash; particularly one outside the U.S. &ndash; most M&amp;A activity is driven by the desire to grow or lead in a particular business sector. Purchasing a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; company before your competition &ndash; especially one that&rsquo;s on the cutting edge of your industry &ndash; is a popular way to remain competitive. Rapid growth through a merger or acquisition can be appealing to companies who want to outshine their rivals &ndash; made even better when the two likeminded companies join forces, eliminate overlapping resources and doubly focus on boosting the bottom line. Mergers or acquisitions can also be beneficial to companies wanting to diversify their offerings or expand their footprint geographically.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">M&amp;A impact on shareholders </span></h5>
<p>If your company is acquired by another firm, your company&rsquo;s stock will most likely rise on the announcement because the acquiring firm is usually required to pay a premium. The premium is an incentive for the seller to accept the offer. A recent example of this is Microsoft&rsquo;s offer to buy LinkedIn. The proposed acquisition was announced on June 13, 2016, and that same day the stock of LinkedIn jumped more than 46% as shares moved upwards towards the offer price.  </p>
<p>If your company acquires another firm, the reverse is likely to happen: due to your company paying a premium for the deal (plus debt, expenses or loss of productivity associated with the acquisition), your company&rsquo;s stock is likely to fall. In the long run, however, following a smooth acquisition, your company&rsquo;s stock should normalize and ultimately yield better long-term performance and dividends. This pattern is also evident in the Microsoft/LinkedIn transaction. On the day of the announcement LinkedIn shares jumped 46%, but Microsoft&rsquo;s stock declined more than 2.5%. Since that time, Microsoft&rsquo;s stock has climbed steadily as the acquisition has been completed and, to date, there has been a smooth integration.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>The dramatic increase in the price of the acquired company&rsquo;s stock may result in a significant boost in wealth for those shareholders that own a large position. This often includes employees of the acquired firm who have been rewarded with stock options or other forms of stock based compensation. In that instance, it&rsquo;s wise to explore diversification strategies that can help lock in the newly acquired wealth. </p>
<p> There can be tax implications for shareholders if the transaction is paid in stock instead of cash. Simply trading one stock for another isn&rsquo;t a tax event in the eyes of the IRS, but capital gains or losses will apply upon the sale of the new company stock or to the cash received as a result of the merger or acquisition.  </p>
<p>There are various ways that a company can structure mergers and acquisitions, including a stock purchase agreement (SPA) and an asset purchase agreement (APA):  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Stock purchase agreements are employed when a company uses its own stock to pay for another, executed between the purchasing company and the shareholders of the target company. This approach is often used to give incentive to stakeholders who are hesitant about the deal &ndash; and it only receives single taxation (at the shareholder level) instead of taxation at both the shareholder and corporate level. Under a SPA, the purchasing company receives all of the target company&rsquo;s assets &ndash; and its liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Asset purchase agreements are used when the purchasing company buys select assets owned by the target company according to certain terms, conditions and schedules. Not all assets must be purchased and the purchasing company can negotiate which of the target company&rsquo;s liabilities to assume, as well. Asset purchase agreements can take longer to execute because of their flexible terms.  </li>
</ul>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">M&amp;A impact on employees </span></h5>
<p>One of the biggest impacts that mergers and acquisitions can have on employees is on their retirement plans. According to the IRS, the following things can happen:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Sponsorship by the new company &ndash; If only one company had a retirement plan before the merger, the new company may sponsor it. Those who were covered on the previous plan may experience no change while those who didn&rsquo;t formerly have a plan may need to join.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Merger of plans &ndash; If both companies had retirement plans, they may merge the plans to have only one that covers all employees. Merged plans cannot violate the anti-cutback rule, which protects accrued, early retirement, optional and other benefits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Adoption of a completely new plan &ndash; Companies may opt to terminate previous plans and offer a new plan altogether. The IRS says, &ldquo;Upon termination, each employee is 100% vested in their defined benefit plan&rsquo;s accrued benefits and their defined contribution plan&rsquo;s account balance regardless of the plan&rsquo;s vesting schedule.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions can also have a big impact on employee morale, particularly if the M&amp;A activity is hostile. Stress, fear about layoffs or losing benefits, and increased competition &ndash; especially when two similar companies merge and there are job redundancies &ndash; can all contribute to lower employee morale and lower productivity as a result.  </p>
<p>Companies that stay on top of employee morale can make it through the M&amp;A process more smoothly. Surveying employees and asking for their candid feedback before, during and after the change is a good way to keep a gauge on the &ldquo;mood&rdquo; at the office &ndash; and offering an open-door policy for discussing concerns can help. Consider adding new perks, like an increase in vacation days, discounts on mental and physical health services and team-building events to help ease the transition and curb negativity before it festers.   </p>

After raising interest rates only once in each of the past two years, we believe a recovery in corporate earnings, increased wage inflation and an increase in fiscal spending will drive the Federal Reserve to raise the fed funds rates more than once in 2017. </p>
<p>The current media narrative would have investors believe that foreign investors are afraid that U.S. stimulus will lead to rising inflation and bigger deficits. With foreigners holding approximately 43% of U.S. government debt, investors fear that policy missteps by the U.S. could lead to foreign retaliation through aggressive selling of U.S. Treasuries. While this dystopian scenario can&rsquo;t be ruled out, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely. Under most scenarios, the U.S. Treasury yield will increase only gradually in 2017.</p>
<p>If you look at the change in Treasury holdings, it reveals that China is by far the most active seller, with the selling largely attributed to the country&rsquo;s own efforts to stem capital outflows and to prevent a rapid depreciation of its currency. There is a leadership transition later this year in China, and policy makers are trying their utmost to prevent the economy from wobbling. Both China and Japan are selling for unique reasons tied to stabilizing their economies.</p>
<p>After hitting a high of close to 2.60% in the middle of December, the 10-year Treasury yield has retreated, with the 10-year Treasury currently yielding 2.45%. After Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen&rsquo;s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress on February 14, and combined with stronger than expected CPI inflation, the probability of three rate hikes this year has increased to nearly 40%. Bigger picture, bond yields remain close to 140 year lows and, prospectively, yields will likely adjust upward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post-election, President Trump has spent political capital on several initiatives away from tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending. These efforts, including those tied to immigration and repealing the Affordable Care Act, at the very least will postpone the effects of a Trump stimulus plan. Furthermore, while the market remains ebullient that government spending will jump start the economy, there is skepticism over the size and scale of a stimulus package. Due to the president&rsquo;s pursuit of other agendas, passage of a stimulus package will likely be postponed to the end of this year if not until 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, GDP bears closer resemblance to a tanker than a speedboat. GDP growth will remain constrained by both demographics and productivity, neither of which can turn on a dime. Specifically, the combination of greying demographics and sub 2% annual productivity growth acts as restrictor plates on GDP growth. While the economic upswing that began at the end of last year has gained momentum into 2017, stronger economic activity will be constrained by these secular factors. Concerns that a sharp acceleration in GDP growth could lead to the Federal Reserve raising rates at a frantic pace are likely unfounded.</p>
<p>While we continue to believe that we are in store for more rate hikes, we also believe the Federal Reserve will remain data dependent and the pace of hikes will be measured and well telegraphed. Recent chatter has increased regarding selling the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s $4.5 trillion holdings of government bonds, which could cause interest rates to spike higher. In her Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Chair Yellen indicated she would focus on reestablishing interest rates as an instrument in the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s toolkit. Historically, the Federal Reserve has been able to cut rates to accommodate a weakening economy. To cut rates in times of economic weakness, interest rates must be raised to a sufficiently high level to provide room for future cuts. Selling bonds held by the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be a 2017 event. A decision to shrink the Fed balance sheet will likely be well broadcasted given the Fed&rsquo;s recent experience with the &ldquo;taper tantrum.&rdquo; Recall in Spring 2013 investors panicked when the Fed announced it would likely start slowing down the pace of bond purchases later in 2013. Overall, we expect the Federal Reserve will continue to act in a methodical and deliberate fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, we believe the fed funds rate will likely rise for the remainder of the year, with between two to three rate hikes in 2017, yet, under most scenarios, we do not believe the path will be a steep spike upward. &nbsp;</p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Start with a budget </span></h5>
<p>Financial planning begins with getting a handle on your budget, collecting all relevant financial information, cataloging your assets and understanding where and how you spend. Set savings goals and stick to them; our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/bp_year-endchecklist_downloadable_f1.pdf?sfvrsn=2">annual financial checklist</a> can help. It&rsquo;s important to know your sources of income now versus later, like employment, a pension, Social Security or an IRA. Consider that women live, on average, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html#xx" target="_blank">five years longer than men</a> and are more likely to be widowed. And according to the latest census data, women outnumbered men nearly 2-to-1 by the time they were age 85 &ndash; a fact women should take into consideration when planning for future income.<br />

&nbsp;  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Make your cash reserve a priority</span></h5>
<p>Because cash reserves are usually allocated for emergencies or unexpected costs, quick access to your reserve and liquidity is key. The unexpected need for cash can arise after a <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/10/26/financial-planning-for-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis-or-other-major-medical-event" target="_blank">major medical event</a> or major life change like divorce. Hold cash reserves in bank accounts or stable investment accounts that allow you to withdraw money at any time without being penalized, such as checking or savings accounts, money-market accounts or short-term Treasury bills. We recommend keeping an equivalent of three to six months living expenses in your reserve. </p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Go to school on your investments  </span></h5>
<p>Just like you need to balance your budget, getting a handle on financial planning involves balancing your portfolio and considering its risk relative to the potential reward. By diversifying across the spectrum from the safest investments to those that are more volatile (see chart below), you can reduce risk in your portfolio without giving up an equivalent level of potential return. Accordingly, you should evaluate your overall financial goals, investment timeframe and tolerance for investing in high-risk securities then begin to allocate your assets. As you work through this process, your primary goal should be to maximize the potential return while staying within the bounds of your risk tolerance. Most people will end up with a broad mix of investments that span the entire spectrum in the chart below. People with a higher risk tolerance can accept greater volatility in their portfolio and will generally have a higher weighting to the riskier investments. The opposite will be true for those with a lower risk tolerance.<br />

<p>In terms of balancing your portfolio, you must pay attention to an asset&rsquo;s potential for growth and dividends (regular payments by a company to its shareholders from its profits or cash reserves) as changes in interest rates and the rate of growth in the economy will have a differing impact on these return drivers. We typically recommend clients balance stocks with low growth and high dividends alongside stocks with high growth and no dividends to maximize the potential for gain while lowering the level of risk.
</p>
<p>The last eight years have been characterized by exceptionally low interest rates and an extended period of rising equity markets. In this environment, it is critical to make sure your portfolio is not stuck in a concentrated position, potentially catching you off guard when rates rise or the economy makes an unexpected shift. Click the following links to read more about <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/09/02/how-your-investment-portfolio-is-like-a-picnic-basket-or-should-be" target="_blank">balancing your portfolio</a> and the <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/07/13/the-risky-business-of-concentrated-equity" target="_blank">risks of a concentrated equity position</a>.  </p>
<p>Since interest rates have been low, it&rsquo;s a good time to consider what will happen to your portfolio when they rise. Some industries benefit from rate hikes, like banks and insurance so we believe it is good time to invest in those sectors. In contrast, income-oriented investments generally fall in value, as interest rates rise, to bring their yields up to those offered by the rest of the market.&nbsp; </p>
<p> It is also important to pay attention to the structure of investments and not just their inherent volatility. For example, individual bonds remain attractive in this environment in spite of the fact that there is potential for an increase in interest rates. Individual bonds have a set term to maturity. As time passes the market value converges towards the stated maturity value regardless of the direction of interest rates. In a rising rate environment, an upward movement in rates will push the current market value of the bond down, but that will be offset with the passage of time as the bond approaches maturity. In contrast, a bond fund never matures. Therefore, as interest rates rise the value of the bond fund declines and there is no offsetting benefit from the underlying bonds moving closer to their maturity value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Protect your wealth  </span></h5>
<p>There are several things women can do to ensure their financial futures. First, it&rsquo;s important to save early and aggressively for <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/06/24/retirement-planning-101-this-is-not-your-grandparents-retirement" target="_blank">retirement</a>. Remember that women live longer than men on average, so they&rsquo;ll need retirement savings for a longer amount of time. Couple that with the fact that women make 79 cents for every dollar men earn on average and that women are more likely to leave the workforce to care for a child or <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/08/09/things-to-consider-as-our-parents-age" target="_blank">aging parent</a>. For these reasons, women should not delay saving for retirement &ndash; it could mean losing out on the compounding effects of investing early.  </p>
<p>Protecting wealth also means protecting your <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/08/15/the-state-of-your-estate-three-things-you-should-know-about-estate-planning" target="_blank">estate</a>. Begin by calculating your net worth and determining ownership of assets. Then, decide upon your beneficiary; review your will and trust, power of attorney and health care directive; make a list of assets, instructions and passwords; and determine the amount of potential estate tax you&rsquo;ll be required to pay. In many states, like Washington, there is both federal and state estate tax to contend with. The sooner you plan, and the clearer you are with your intentions, the less likely there will be issues or disagreements amongst family members down the road. </p>
<p>Another area where women can avoid pitfalls is making sure to keep tabs on their insurance plans. Often, people have too little, or too much insurance &ndash; or just &ldquo;get it and forget it&rdquo; without regularly evaluating plans to see if they&rsquo;re offering the lowest cost coverage that suits their needs. It&rsquo;s also very important to understand the limits of the plan&rsquo;s coverage to avoid surprises later.

<h4>Economy</h4>
<p>The U.S. economy continues to grow at a modest pace although, consistent with the trend of the last few years, growth accelerated in the latter half of 2016. Looking forward, we expect the expansion to continue, fueled by the combination of a pro-growth agenda of the new administration and accommodative monetary policy. In fact, the economy should expand at a faster pace than in prior years if the administration is able to implement their plans for tax cuts, stimulative government spending and deregulation. Accordingly, our central bank may be able to raise interest rates at a more rapid pace in the coming year.&nbsp;   </p>
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<p>Inflation remains low, but it has been trending upwards. In fact, it is too early to say definitively, but we may be shifting from an environment of deflation to one of reflation. In 2015, inflation hovered around zero and in 2016 it averaged approximately 1%. The increase was driven by the strength in prices for medical care, services and housing. Looking forward, we expect inflation to continue to rise given the increase in the price of oil, rising wage inflation, the agenda of the new administration in the U.S. and a gradual shift away from negative interest rate policies in Europe and Japan.&nbsp;   </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">U.S. Dollar </span></h4>
<p>The U.S. dollar increased significantly after the presidential election given rising interest rates, the new administration&rsquo;s economic platform and their plans to renegotiate trade agreements. In the coming months, we expect the dollar to remain elevated as President Trump attempts to implement his agenda and foreign economies remain somewhat soft.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Asset Class  </span></h5>
<h4>Cash and Money Market Instruments </h4>
<p>The October implementation of new SEC rules governing money market mutual funds has resulted in higher interest rates for non-government securities that have short terms to maturity. The&nbsp;new rules were introduced to increase the systemic stability of money market funds given severe dislocations during the 2008 crisis and the European crisis in 2011. The introduction of floating net asset values (NAVs) and redemption restrictions based on liquidity has led to an exodus from prime money market funds to government funds. This transition has driven up interest rates for non-government securities and generated strong demand for short-term Treasuries. In addition to the money market mutual fund reform, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in December.&nbsp; With the expectation for additional hikes in 2017, there is an upward bias to money market rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </p>
<h4>Intermediate Government and Credit Bonds </h4>
<p>While economic data displayed signs of improvement late in the third quarter, the selloff in Treasuries gained steam after investors began to digest the new administration&rsquo;s pro-growth agenda. For several years, the central banks and monetary policy were the only game in town. The focus has now shifted to fiscal policy with hopes of higher real and nominal GDP growth driven by expectations for tax reform, infrastructure spending and reduced regulation. Stronger economic data drove the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December. They also increased their outlook for additional rate hikes this year from two to three. While investment grade corporate bonds remain our preference in the taxable bond universe due to the additional yield over Treasuries, we will closely monitor how the new administration&rsquo;s ideas are transformed into policy and how these policies are implemented.  </p>
<h4>Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds </h4>
<p>The municipal sector must contend with rising interest rates as well as concerns related to potential policy initiatives under President Trump. In the coming year, lawmakers will be looking at potential tax reform and the continuing status of tax exemption. A reduction in tax rates as proposed by President Trump may impact demand for tax-free bonds on the margin, but tax exemption will remain valuable to investors subject to high tax rates.&nbsp; Increased infrastructure spending has also been highlighted as a concern but the details have yet to be laid out. Financing for such stimulus may not even come in the form of traditional municipal bond issuance as many fear. We prefer utility enterprises, general airport revenue bonds and established surface transportation agencies. In contrast, we remain cautious on state and local governments that have significantly underfunded pensions.  </p>
<h4>U.S. Equity  </h4>
<p>The stock market finished 2016 with a strong rally led by gains in finance and small cap stocks. As we progress into 2017, we expect the market to trend higher driven by the pro-growth agenda of the new administration and a resumption of earnings growth. Earnings declined in 2015 and throughout much of 2016, but should return to growth given a continuation of the economic expansion and a recovery in the price of oil. Corporate tax cuts, if implemented, should also provide a significant boost to profits as the savings on the reduced tax will fall right to the bottom line. While stocks are expected to provide solid gains, returns may be tempered by valuations that are above average. We also expect volatility to increase as the new administration attempts to implement its agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h4>International Equity </h4>
<p>In response to difficulties in their attempts to generate an enduring economic expansion, foreign governments continue to utilize a myriad of strategies, including aggressive monetary policies. Given the strong actions by these governments and attractive valuations, international stocks are compelling from a long-term perspective. However, in the short-term we expect these markets to remain volatile given a strong U.S. dollar, upcoming elections in France and Germany, a lack of consistent economic growth, an undercapitalized banking system in Europe and excessive debt levels in some countries.   </p>
<h4>Commodity  </h4>
<p>After declining dramatically in recent years, commodity prices have rebounded from their lows. Oil and industrial metals increased significantly last year. A decline in U.S. oil production growth, along with OPEC&rsquo;s agreement to cut supply, resulted in a reversal in oil prices after a steady drop that started in June of 2014. Metals prices increased given an expected increase in economic growth and rising demand from China. Looking forward, we expect prices to remain volatile, but to trend upward as the global economic expansion continues.   </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Potential Threats  </span></h5>
<p>Risks and Notable Items to Watch  </p>
<h4>Rising Protectionist Sentiment</h4>
<p>Globally, there is a rising protectionist sentiment that is fueling a backlash against free trade. While much of the rhetoric is likely a function of positioning for negotiating leverage, there is a risk that supply chains will be negatively impacted and costs for some goods will increase.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h4>Geopolitical Risks</h4>
<p>Conflicts in many parts of the world have escalated with Russia&rsquo;s involvement in Syria and a number of terror attacks in Europe. Just as important, heightened tensions in the South China Sea, including recent interactions between the U.S. and China, also present some risk.</p>
<h4>U.S./China Relations</h4>
<p>The new administration is taking a different approach in its relationship with China. Instead of focusing on threats emanating from China&rsquo;s long-term goals, the new administration is placing a stronger emphasis on trade and the loss of U.S. jobs. This includes threats to label China a currency manipulator which may spark an increase in tariffs or significantly damage trade relations.</p>
<h4>Debt Related Issues</h4>
<p>Sovereign debt levels continue to grow throughout much of the world, generating conditions associated with low rates of economic growth. In response to the low growth rates, there has been a meaningful shift in the willingness to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. However, if the initiatives are debt financed, they run the risk of exacerbating the issue and creating more significant problems in the long-term.  </p>
<h4>Policy Risks</h4>
<p>There are persistent deflationary forces in the current environment, but the new administration plans to implement a significant change in policy. These policies of tax cuts, renegotiating trade agreements and increased government spending may result in more inflationary pressure than intended. &nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h4>Cyber Security</h4>
<p>Cyber security is becoming a significant issue given persistent attacks on the international money transfer system, known as SWIFT, and on systemically important financial institutions.  </p>

The following are some resolution recommendations categorized by age group with a focus on the life events typically experienced by those in each range.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Resolutions for those 17 or younger </span></h4>
<p>As Joline Godfrey says in her book, <em>Raising Financially Fit Kids</em>, &ldquo;The children who become most content as adults learn to use their resources in ways that give them deep satisfaction.&rdquo; Help your child flex this skill by choosing financial resolutions that are focused on saving for, budgeting around and donating to things that give them a sense of purpose. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Steer them toward resolutions like:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Learning about saving, spending and donating by dividing their allowance into different buckets each month</li>
    <li>Creating an entertainment spending budget and sticking to it</li>
    <li>Researching different charities and making a donation  </li>
</ul>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Resolutions for those who are 18-24 </span></h4>
<p>The majority of younger workers disregard employer-sponsored retirement plans. According to Employee Benefit Research Institute, less than one-fifth of workers age 21 to 24 participated in an employer-based retirement plan in 2013, the most recent year for which figures are available. But those who save early may make more over the long haul. If you consistently save $200 each month beginning at age 20 and earn 8% annually you will have accumulated around $1,000,000 by age 65. If you delay starting the same monthly savings plan until age 30, you will have accumulated around $450,000 by age 65. In this example, you would have contributed about 30% more money than someone who starts saving the same amount at age 30, but end up with around twice as much money. The extra 10 years of compounding returns puts the early saver at an extreme advantage in retirement. Starting early is the best way to plan for a secure retirement. </p>
<p>Resolve to:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>As a starting point, contribute the maximum amount matched by your employer, or the maximum you can afford, to an employer-sponsored retirement plan </li>
    <li>Identify any large expenses planned for the year, and create and stick to a monthly budget to pay for them so your retirement savings plan does not get derailed</li>
    <li>Track your monthly expenses using a financial app like Minted, Mvelopes, Wally or Bill Guard </li>
</ul>
<h4>Resolutions for those who are 25-44</h4>
<p>Major changes that affect your financial life often happen during your late 20s through your early 40s. The average age to get married in the U.S. is 27.9 (Priceonomics), while the average age for couples going through their first divorce is 30 years old (McKinley Irvin Family Law). During this time, there are home purchases and sales, major promotions at work, relocations, babies and more. Choose resolutions that are about evaluating where you are now and where you want to be later&mdash;and actively pursue those goals.  </p>
<p>Resolve to:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
    <li> Take steps to ensure that your credit is in excellent shape in advance of large first or second home purchases</li>
    <li>Reassess your risk tolerance with your current situation in mind and adjust your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/09/02/how-your-investment-portfolio-is-like-a-picnic-basket-or-should-be">investment portfolio</a> as needed </li>
    <li>Start a <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/09/15/the-411-on-the-529-everything-you-need-to-know-about-saving-for-college-with-529-plans" target="_blank">529</a> or other college fund for each of your children and make monthly contributions&mdash;even if they&rsquo;re babies </li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Resolutions for those who are 45-64 </span></h4>
<p>With retirement on the not-too-distant horizon, now is the time to pay off debt and save for the future as aggressively as possible. Unexpected medical issues can arise during this timeframe, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to also think about how you&rsquo;ll prepare for a <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/10/26/financial-planning-for-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis-or-other-major-medical-event" target="_blank">major medical event</a>. Include a comprehensive evaluation of your financial life in the next meeting with your wealth manager. Consider resolutions that are focused on safeguarding you and your family after you retire.  </p>
<p>Resolve to:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Upgrade your homeowner&rsquo;s insurance for any major upgrades/renovations to your home</li>
    <li>Review the amount of income needed for <a href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/06/24/retirement-planning-101-this-is-not-your-grandparents-retirement" target="_blank">retirement</a> to come up with a monthly savings plan</li>
    <li>Establish an emergency medical fund and contribute to it regularly Honestly assess your &ldquo;next generation launch plan,&rdquo; if you have children </li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Resolutions for those who are 65+ </span></h4>
<p>Life post-retirement looks different financially than it did when you were employed. Health care costs, reducing taxes and protecting yourself financially should be at the forefront of your annual resolutions.  </p>
<p>Resolve to: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Review your long-term care and disability income insurance plans; determine if they continue to meet your coverage needs</li>
    <li>Analyze the possibility of converting your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to reduce taxes </li>
    <li>Get your free annual credit check and stay on top of your score and accounts monthly to protect yourself against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/12/08/protect-yourself-from-identity-theft">identity theft</a></li>
    <li>Consider the long-term viability of any next generation support or gifts  </li>
</ul>
<p>No matter your age, it&rsquo;s a good idea to evaluate your financial plan in the beginning of each year to make sure it&rsquo;s in line with your personal and financial goals.  </p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/11/18/give-a-little-bit-charitable-gifts-and-when-to-make-them"><img title="ResolvingToGiveMoreCharity_CTA2" alt="ResolvingToGiveMoreCharity_CTA2" data-displaymode="Original" src="https://www.badgley.com/images/default-source/cta/resolvingtogivemorecharity_cta2.png?sfvrsn=2" /></a>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 19:30:00 Zurn:uuid:9fc1f344-abe9-6626-a8f8-ff0000ddfb2ahttps://www.badgley.com/blog/blog/2016/12/16/federal-reserve-raises-key-policy-rate Federal Reserve raises key policy rate<p> After raising interest rates for the first time in seven years on December 16, 2015, roughly a year later, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) unanimously decided to raise the target Fed funds range, this time by another 25 basis points to a range of 0.50-0.75bps.&nbsp;This marks only the second rate increase in the decade and is reflective of the sluggish economic recovery. While this is a notable event, the move by the Fed had been telegraphed and was widely expected by the market.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Accompanying the hike in rates, new projections show the Federal Reserve now expects three 25 basis point rate hikes in 2017, which is up from their previous guidance of two. The drop in the unemployment rate from 4.9% to 4.6% in November, the lowest rate since August 2007, was one factor driving the upward revision in projections. In addition to lower unemployment, inflation expectations have also increased. Some FOMC participants also factored in higher fiscal spending into their outlook, which contributed to the increase in projected hikes from two to three. &nbsp; </p>
<p>The market had expected Chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen to remain dovish, yet comments made during the press conference were interpreted as hawkish. In addition to stating that the labor market would likely reach full employment without fiscal stimulus, Yellen also indicated that monetary policy was on course to achieve its 2% inflation target. &nbsp; </p>
<p>There is room for the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate projections to be revised upward. To preserve political objectivity, the Federal Reserve does not include President-elect Trump&rsquo;s fiscal stimulus plan into its projections. Implementation of the new administration&rsquo;s agenda may spur higher growth and inflation which would ultimately push rates upward. Through a combination of tax cuts, government spending and deregulation, the new administration is targeting a goal of 3% to 4% GDP growth. While Mr. Trump has strong conviction on passing a robust fiscal spending package, the devil will be in the detail. The size and the scope of the fiscal stimulus plan could be slimmed down by political and budgetary realities.  </p>
<p>The recent and sudden rise in longer term rates has come after the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit an all-time low of 1.36% on July 8, 2016, post Brexit vote, and stood just below 1.80% on election night. Shortly after the Federal Reserve decision, the comparable rates have increased to 2.60%.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>While this December hike is analogous with last year&rsquo;s December hike, we believe that there is a stronger likelihood that the Federal Reserve will follow through with additional hikes in 2017 and the July 8th all-time lows likely hold. Entering 2016, four rate hikes were penciled in. Those expectations were quickly dashed as the equity market swooned in January due to concerns related to slowing growth in China, negative interest rates and plunging oil prices. While a macro-economic shock could again throw the plan off course, the Federal Reserve is closer to achieving its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">For families </span></h4>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Tucson</span></h5>
<h4>  </h4>
<p>Experiencing a family vacation on horseback surrounded by majestic scenery could be a great way to &ldquo;wow&rdquo; everyone in the family. There are several authentic ranch experiences in and around Tucson to choose from where the family can do everything from panning for gold to learning how to rope like Billy the Kid. Plus, there are plenty of nearby natural wonders to experience, like the Sonoran Desert, Saguaro National Forest, Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and Painted Desert.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Denmark</span>  </h5>
<p>Those young at heart will love Denmark for its architecture, local flavor and vibrancy, while the younger set will flip for the zoos (Copenhagen, Aalborg and Givskud), waterparks and multitude of theme parks, including Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen and Bakken just north. Plus, brick-lovers large and small can experience the original LEGOLAND in Billund, where all things LEGO began.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">For couples </span></h4>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Iceland  </span></h5>
<p>Hot springs, glaciers, volcanoes, Northern Lights&mdash;Iceland is a great option for couples who want to experience seemingly-otherworldly panoramic views. With direct flights from several major cities, including Seattle, Iceland is the wonderland that&rsquo;s closer than you think. Go on exploratory day trips out from your home base in the capital city of Reykjavik.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Machu Picchu  </span></h5>
<p>The historical Incan citadel in Peru&rsquo;s Andes Mountains was built in the 15th century for reasons no one can explain, and now is a bucket list item for travelers around the world. Visit the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana calendar stone and the Temple of the Three Windows; hike part or all of the Inca Trail and stay and soak in the hot springs in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes. </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">For seniors </span></h4>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Tanzania  </span></h5>
<p>If a safari is your game, you may want to check out Tanzania. Nearly one third of the country is protected for wildlife viewing at parks like Salous, Katavi, Serengeti, Ruaha, Tarangire, Great Migration, Lake Manyara and more. There are nearly as many lodging options to choose from as there are parks, with options for every style and taste, from the traditional tent to the more luxurious private accommodations.  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Maldives  </span></h5>
<p>If you crave sun, the Maldives could be right for you, with traditional and water sports, scuba diving and more set against the backdrop of the white sand beaches on the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. Stay on a resort island or in a guest house or city hotel&mdash;or opt for a luxurious liveaboard for easy-access water exploration.  </p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Jerusalem</span></h5>
<h4> </h4>
<p>&ldquo;Simon Montefiore said, &lsquo;Nothing makes a place holier than the competition of another religion.&rsquo; No other city in the world boasts the complexity of past and present as the City of Jerusalem. The Old (walled) City is a maze of small alleyways, shops and religious sites of the three great Abrahamic religions. To visit Jerusalem is to go back in time to a world of merchants, religious leaders and pilgrims.&nbsp; It is a city of conflict, passion and beauty. If a city can be alive to the contradictions of today&rsquo;s modern world, that city is Jerusalem.&rdquo; </p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Tuscany </span></h5>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years ago, my family traveled to Italy for two-and-half weeks; one of those, we spent in beautiful Tuscany. My wife, children, parents and I rented a villa located on an olive orchard which also boasted a castle nearby. We loved the villa and the nearby town of Montelupo Fiorentino with its food stores, pottery shops, restaurants and olive orchards/wineries. We&rsquo;ll always remember the unique cultural experience of Tuscany.&rdquo; </p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Hartstene Pointe, Shelton, WA </span></h5>
<p>&ldquo;Located on the north tip of Harstine Island in the south Puget Sound, this unique community is amongst old growth trees and surrounded by three miles of beach to explore.&nbsp; A summer visit is the best when you can enjoy the community pool, tennis courts and share the hiking trails with friendly deer.&rdquo; </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Financial tips for travel </span></h5>
<p> No matter the destination on your calendar this year, keep in mind these financial tips for travelers:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Be sure to notify your bank of your travel plans, so credit and ATM cards won&rsquo;t receive fraud alerts when you use them outside your normal spending area</li>
    <li>Bring several forms of payment, as not all credit cards are accepted everywhere</li>
    <li>Invest in travelers&rsquo; insurance to safeguard you and your loved ones from accident or theft </li>
    <li>If you currently use a 5-digit PIN number, switch to a 4-digit PIN before you go since many foreign ATMs only accept the latter</li>
    <li>Save your bank and credit card 800 numbers in your phone or with your passport   </li>

That amounts to $35,600 stolen per minute, &ldquo;or enough to pay for four years of college in just four minutes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The fact is there are hidden risks within our connected lives. If you&rsquo;ve been a victim of identity theft or know someone who has, you know that correcting the damage is time consuming and can be costly. Here are some tips for lessening your risk of identity theft.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Watch your wallet </span></h4>
<p>Limit what you carry in your wallet. Social security numbers are often used in fraudulent transactions, so you should avoid carrying your social security card with you. Only carry the credit, debit and identification cards you need.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Mind your mailbox </span></h4>
<p>Reduce the opportunity for mail theft by taking your outgoing mail to your local post office. When traveling, have a neighbor pick up your mail&mdash;or request a vacation hold for your mail at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usps.com/">USPS</a> website. It&rsquo;s a good idea to opt out of those pre-approved credit or insurance offers that take up your mailbox by visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t">optoutprescreen.com</a>. Also, take note of when your bills arrive each month and if bills are late, call the creditor to make sure an identity thief hasn&rsquo;t changed your billing address to keep you from detecting fraudulent charges.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Buzz your bank  </span></h4>
<p>Ask your bank about adding fraud alerts to your account. These can be sent via text, email or through a phone call&mdash;and can be a first line of defense against fraudulent transactions. </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Protect your personal information  </span></h4>
<p>Never give your social security number or other personal information like your mother&rsquo;s maiden name or account number to strangers that contact you by phone, email or postal mail. Identity thieves may &ldquo;phish&rdquo; for details, posing as a bank, business or government employee using official-looking emails in order to obtain access to your personal information. Visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.antiphishing.org/">Anti-Phishing Working Group</a> for more information and red flags.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Seize the shredder  </span></h4>
<p>Make a practice of shredding receipts, credit offers, credit applications, insurance forms, physician statements, checks, financial statements, expired credit cards and similar documents. Some security experts recommend shredding any paper with your name on the document or receipt.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Keep tabs on your credit </span></h4>
<p>One of the best ways to protect yourself against identity theft is to monitor your credit. Closely monitor your bank, credit and brokerage accounts online, and take advantage or your free annual credit report from each of the national credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Many big banks and credit card companies now allow cardholders free access to their FICO score on a regular basis. Check to see if your bank or card offers this feature, or visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action">annualcreditreport.com</a> to order your free report.  </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Defend your devices </span></h4>
<p>Never open files, click on links or download programs sent by strangers. If an email seems suspicious, look up the contact information you have on file, and reach out to confirm that the correct person or company sent the email.  </p>
<p>In addition, take the following steps to secure your electronic devices:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid public wireless networks when accessing confidential information and accounts</li>
    <li>Install antivirus, antispyware software and a firewall on your computer(s)</li>
    <li>Routinely update your security software</li>
    <li>Use strong and creative passwords; consider a password services like Last Pass for help</li>
    <li>Keep your browser secure and use encryption software that scrambles information sent over the internet </li>
    <li>Use a wipe utility program to overwrite hard drives before disposing of computers</li>
    <li>When disposing of a mobile device, follow instructions from your service provider on how to transfer then delete information, then shred your old SIM card using scissors, damaging the bronze foil area of the chip, where the data is stored, as much as possible  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you&rsquo;ve detected fraudulent activity, immediately notify the financial institution where the activity happened and ask to have your account frozen or locked. Take another look at your credit report for confirmation and report verified fraudulent activity to the authorities.   <br />

<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Tax saving strategies  </span></h5>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s consider some things you can do before December 31st to reduce your tax liability for 2016. </p>
<h4>Tax-loss harvesting</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Selling certain taxable investments at a loss could offset any capital gains you&rsquo;ve realized during the year. If you have underperforming positions that would generate a capital loss if sold, consider selling them prior to the end of the year to offset any of your realized capital gains for the year. If your losses exceed your gains for the year, you can use up to $3,000 of the excess losses to offset your ordinary income. Any additional losses beyond the $3,000 annual limit may be carried forward for use in future years.  </p>
<p>When using this strategy, be aware of the IRS &ldquo;wash-sale&rdquo; rules which prevent you from deducting losses on the sale of a security if you buy back the same security within a 61-day period&mdash;30 days before the sale and 30 days after the sale. </p>
<h4>Gifting </h4>
<p>During the holiday season, it seems timely to make gifts to support your favorite charitable organization and realize deductions and/or give to loved ones and maximize your annual gift exclusions&mdash;up to $14,000 per individual. </p>
<p>The most common type of charitable contributions are direct cash gifts. However, consider gifting appreciated stock to your favorite charitable cause. Not only will you receive an income tax deduction for the fair market value of the stock, you will also remove the accumulated capital gains from your portfolio. For individuals over the age of 70&frac12;, you may be able to make a qualified charitable contribution of up to $100,000 directly from your IRA. The donation would count toward your required minimum distribution and reduce your taxable income for the year. You also might consider setting up a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/11/18/give-a-little-bit-charitable-gifts-and-when-to-make-them">Donor Advised Fund or Private Foundation</a> to receive an immediate income tax deduction. </p>
<p>The IRS allows you to make tax-free gifts of up to $14,000 per year ($28,000 for married couples) to as many individuals as you&rsquo;d like. These gifts will not be subject to federal gift taxes and will not be considered taxable income for the recipient. Apart from making direct cash gifts, consider contributing these tax-free gifts to a 529 plan for your children/grandchildren. Funds contributed to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgley.com/blog/post/blog/2016/09/15/the-411-on-the-529-everything-you-need-to-know-about-saving-for-college-with-529-plans">529 plan</a> grow tax-deferred and withdrawals used for eligible educational expenses are tax-free. A special provision of 529 plans allows you to front-load the plan using an accelerated gifting schedule by contributing a lump sum of $70,000 ($140,000 if married filing jointly) in the first year of a five-year period without creating a taxable gift. This clearly amplifies the wealth transfer potential and is worthy of careful consideration. For example, a married couple with four grandchildren could reduce their taxable estate up to $560,000 by contributing to four separate 529 plan accounts without consuming part of their lifetime gift exemption. </p>
<h4>Defer income and accelerate expenses </h4>
<p>Income you receive in 2016 is taxable in 2016. In some instances, it might make sense to delay the tax bill. If your employer allows you to defer your year-end bonus, consider this strategy to defer some income from this tax year. The delay of the sale of capital gain property and receipt of distributions into 2017 should also be considered to reduce this year&rsquo;s taxable income. Deferring your income into the next tax year only makes sense if you expect to be in the same or lower tax bracket for the next year. </p>
<p>Accelerating your tax-deductible expenses by pre-paying them before the end of the year can also reduce your tax liability this year. Consider pre-paying medical expenses-- if your medical costs exceed 10% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)&mdash;and prepaying recurring deductible expenses like your property taxes. If you are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) or near being subject to AMT, you should consult with your tax advisor before accelerating these expenses. For example, property taxes are not deductible under the AMT. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Financial checklist </span></h5>
<p>In addition to considering the year-end tax savings strategies above, this is a great time of year to review an annual financial checklist and plan&mdash;particularly if you or your family have experienced any major life events this year, such as marriage or divorce, births or deaths, or a job change&mdash;or have major life events on the horizon. While uncomplicated, these preventative maintenance and housekeeping tasks can cause serious consequences, if neglected. </p>

They want to lighten burdens of others. They want to elevate their community. They want to make a difference. </p>
<p>When considering how, when and where to give, it&rsquo;s important to think about which giving option fits best with your goals. Here are the main types of gifts and when to make them. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Direct gifts</span></h5>
<p>This is the most common type of contribution, with donors giving to chosen charities via cash or check, online or through a stock transfer. It is quick and easy, providing an immediate tax deduction and requiring no long-term commitment. That said, these types of gifts are often reactionary&mdash;such as a contribution when prompted at a fundraising event&mdash;instead of part of a well thought-out philanthropic plan that could benefit you and your family in the long term. </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Indirect gifts </span></h5>
<p>Donor-advised funds (DAFs) and private foundations are two ways to establish a longer-term giving strategy. DAFs and foundations might be good options for those wanting control over investments and grant-making, as well as those wanting to establish a charitable legacy. </p>
<p>DAFs support a longer-term strategy in a simple way, allowing gifts to grow, tax-free, over time. As <a href="https://www.nptrust.org/index.php?/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund">National Philanthropic Trust</a> says, &ldquo;An easy way to think about a donor-advised fund is like a charitable savings account: a donor contributes to the fund as frequently as they like and then recommends grants to their favorite charity when they are ready.&rdquo; Donors receive an immediate tax benefit to the maximum the IRS allows. A good time to consider a donor-advised fund is after a major tax or life-changing event. </p>
<p>Private foundations are legal nonprofits and incur expenses to establish and maintain&mdash;as well as require that a percentage of assets be granted each year. Yet while foundations must file tax returns, donors receive income tax deductions for assets contributed to the foundation. Donating through a foundation makes sense when: a family wants to personally deliver checks to the charities they support, it wants to run the foundation and have full legal control and responsibility, it wants to have family members receive compensation for services provided, or it opts to have the foundation support scholarships&mdash;and/or make loans to charities instead of grants. </p>
<p> Sometimes, it makes sense to convert an existing foundation to a donor-advised fund vehicle. As shown in the following table, the costs savings and ease of administration for a donor-advised fund can be considerable.</p>

Split-interest gifts </span></h5>
<p>Split-interest gifts are a good option for donors seeking to generate income from their charitable gift and/or who are firmly committed to supporting a specific charity over the long term. Forms of split-interest gifts include charitable trusts, pooled income funds and charitable gift annuities.</p>
<p>Charitable trusts are established to provide an income stream to an individual or other beneficiary, with a designated charitable organization receiving the balance of the trust when it terminates. These can be either lead trusts, where the charity is paid first and the remainder goes to beneficiaries; or remainder trusts, where the beneficiaries are paid first and the remainder goes to the charity. </p>
<p> Charitable gift annuities and pooled income funds similarly benefit both the donor and the charity. Pooled income funds are mutual funds created from pooled donations, and are not subject to capital gains taxes&mdash;and provide dividends from the investment to both the donor and the charity. Charitable gift annuities are an agreement between a donor and a charity whereby the donor gives a gift to the charity of his/her choosing and receives the immediate tax break, then receives lifetime income from the charity. </p>

When this or other major medical issues present themselves, it&rsquo;s important to be as prepared as possible. That&rsquo;s why we developed this list of questions to ask yourself well in advance of a major medical issue.
</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Are your documents up to date?
</span></h5>
<p>If your will, medical power of attorney and durable power of attorney documents have not been updated within the past three years, now is a good time to take another look. Major medical issues can mean involving others in your care&mdash;and your wishes should be clearly documented.
</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Where would you live if you were to become disabled?
</span></h5>
<p>Now is the time to think about how you would handle different scenarios should you become disabled. For example, if you were disabled but could still live in your current home, you might consider things like whether you would use outside caregivers or rely on friends and family to check-in on you, or whether it could be helpful to use a Life Alert device. Alternatively, if you were to become disabled and could no longer live in your current home, where would you live instead? Who would help you find a new place to live and what support network would you require? Were you to need a temporary assisted living, rehabilitation or nursing home stay, would you keep your house and, if so, who would care for it and your pets?
</p>
<p>In all three disabled-living scenarios, it&rsquo;s important to consider spousal and child care, and where the money will come from in order to cover associated costs. Securing long-term care insurance now could help pay for services to assist with daily living later.
</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">How would you get around if you no longer are able to drive?
</span></h5>
<p>Most of us take for granted our ability to drive ourselves to the grocery store, doctors&rsquo; appointments or to work. But what if a major medical event made it impossible for you to drive temporarily or permanently? If you were no longer able to drive, who would arrange your replacement transportation, and what would that transportation be? How would you pay for that alternate mode of getting around?
</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">How will you pay for medical expenses?
</span></h5>
<p>One of the best ways to start planning financially for a major medical expense is to revisit your insurance plan to make sure it amply covers major issues and, if not, look into the possibility of switching plans. From there, it&rsquo;s a good idea to consider whether you can benefit by opening a Health Savings Account (HSA) as it may be possible to reap tax benefits by contributing the maximum amount allowed to a HSA. You can also talk to your wealth manager about how to invest your HSA.
</p>
<p>Breast cancer diagnoses and other major medical issues can blindside us, but taking steps to answer the tough questions in advance and prepare financially can help ease the burden down the line.
</p>
<p>Unsure whether you&rsquo;re prepared financially for a major medical event? We&rsquo;d be happy to help. <a href="https://www.badgley.com/contact-us" target="_blank">Get in touch today &gt;</a> </p>

<h4>Economy</h4>
<p>The U.S. economy continues to grow at a modest pace. However, weakness in foreign economies, rising government debt levels, and a strong dollar are acting as headwinds. Looking forward, we expect the expansion to continue, but with a growth rate below the norm. Accordingly, our central bank may be able to raise interest rates, but we expect a gradual pace of rate normalization.&nbsp;   </p>
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<p>Inflation remains quite low, but it has been trending upwards. In fact, this year it has been hovering around 1% after spending much of 2015 close to zero. The increase is driven by the strength in prices for medical care, services and housing. Looking forward, we expect inflation to rise modestly given aggressive stimulus policies, a strong employment market and the rebound in commodity prices.&nbsp;   </p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">U.S. Dollar </span></h4>
<p>The U.S. dollar has been strong due to the relative strength of our economy and expectations for an eventual rate hike by the Federal Reserve. In the coming months we expect the dollar to remain elevated since the Fed is seeking higher interest rates while most other central banks have an easing bias.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Asset Class  </span></h5>
<h4>Cash and Money Market Instruments </h4>
<p>New SEC rules governing money market mutual funds have resulted in higher interest rates for non-government securities that have short-term maturities. The&nbsp;new rules are intended to give investors more transparency on a daily basis and additional protection during rare periods of market stress. As a result of the new regulatory environment, money market funds have been net sellers of non-government bonds which has driven up interest rates on these securities while yields on Treasury Bills have remained relatively constant. Of course, the ultimate impact on the supply and cost of short-term loans will become clear after the markets have had time to adjust to the new rules. In the interim, expectations for an eventual rate hike by the Federal Reserve should result in an upward bias to interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </p>
<h4>Intermediate Government and Credit Bonds </h4>
<p>In the face of relatively stable but subdued global growth, central bank actions are the primary drivers of the fixed income markets. In the U.S., improving economic data and a calmer international backdrop have increased the probability of a rate hike later this year. Even with a hike, bond yields will likely stay low and fluctuate within a narrow range given the strong influence of foreign inflows from countries whose governments are pursuing negative interest rates and quantitative easing policies. Investment grade corporate bonds remain our preference in taxable bonds as this sector benefits from modest economic growth and continued strong demand.  </p>
<h4>Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds </h4>
<p>The fundamental backdrop for municipal bonds is generally sound, but we are seeing some deterioration in a few pockets across the country as a result of slower tax revenues, underfunded pension liabilities and the downturn in oil prices. Though new issuance of bonds is expected to be high, strong investor demand should easily absorb the supply.&nbsp;Our portfolio strategy currently emphasizes an enhanced laddered approach focused on intermediate-term bonds, which provides flexibility in a variety of future interest rate environments.  </p>
<h4>U.S. Equity  </h4>
<p>The stock market has been volatile, but has provided solid gains through the first nine months of the year. Stabilization in China&rsquo;s economy, increased stimulus in Europe and Japan, a rebound in oil prices and a modest decline in the U.S. dollar helped to boost equities significantly from their February lows. Looking forward, we expect the stock market to move higher, driven by a continuation of the economic expansion and a rebound in corporate earnings growth. However, volatility is expected to remain elevated as the presidential election approaches, European banks struggle with the need to boost capital and global growth remains modest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h4>International Equity </h4>
<p>In response to difficulties in their attempts to generate an enduring economic expansion, foreign governments continue to utilize a myriad of strategies, including aggressive monetary policies. Given the strong actions by these governments and attractive valuations, international stocks are compelling from a long-term perspective. However, in the short term we expect these markets to remain volatile given the rising political discord in many countries, a lack of consistent economic growth, an undercapitalized banking system in Europe and excessive debt levels.   </p>
<h4>Commodity  </h4>
<p>After declining dramatically in recent years, commodity prices remain relatively subdued, but they have rebounded from their lows. Oil and agricultural markets have been particularly volatile, but reduced supply growth has led to a substantial rebound in oil prices. In contrast, abundant supplies led to a decline in agricultural commodities in the third quarter. &nbsp;Looking forward, the trajectory of commodity prices will primarily be determined by the extent of production cuts in the coming months and the success of foreign governments in boosting their economic growth rates. As the process develops, we expect significant levels of volatility.   </p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;">Potential Threats  </span></h5>
<p>Risks and Notable Items to Watch  </p>
<h4>Policy Risks</h4>
<p>Globally, the fiscal policy response to low growth rates has been debt financed growth initiatives, but there has been little restructuring designed to provide broadly based support. As a result, monetary policy has been the de facto solution. The combination of aggressive monetary policies and rising debt increase the risk of an economic shock.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h4>China</h4>
<p>Growth in China has slowed as the country attempts to shift its growth driver from debt-financed investment, such as infrastructure projects, to domestic consumption. The combination of reduced growth rates and high debt levels increases the risk of a hard landing for their economy.   </p>
<h4>Geopolitical Risks</h4>
<p>Conflicts in many parts of the world have escalated with Russia&rsquo;s involvement in Syria and a number of terror attacks in Europe. In addition, heightened tensions in the South China Sea also present some risk.  </p>
<h4>Debt Related Issues</h4>
<p>Sovereign debt levels continue to grow throughout much of the world generating conditions associated with low rates of economic growth. In addition, high yield and emerging market debt have shown some signs of stress this year providing evidence that the credit cycle is maturing.   </p>
<h4>Deflation</h4>
<p>There are persistent deflationary forces in the current environment. Low commodity prices, high debt levels, a transition in the structure of China&rsquo;s economy and divergent monetary policy between the U.S. and most other countries have resulted in low economic growth rates and rising economic imbalances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<h4>Cyber Security</h4>
<p>Cyber security is becoming a significant issue given persistent attacks on the international money transfer system, known as SWIFT, and on systemically important financial institutions.  </p>
