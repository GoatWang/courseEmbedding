Hospira hires veteran executives to help quell manufacturing woes


(Crain's) — Hospira Inc. has hired three veteran executives, including ones from Baxter International Inc. and Astellas Pharma U.S. Inc., as the Lake Forest-based medical products maker seeks to fix vexing manufacturing woes.In the last quarter, Hospira has added:• Neil Ryding, as senior vice president of devices. He was previously executive vice president of global manufacturing and supply at San Diego-based CareFusion Corp., a medical device company.• Lisa Skeens, as head of regulatory. She was previously vice president for global regulatory affairs at Deerfield-based Baxter International Inc.• Stan Bukofzer, as chief medical officer. He was previously vice president of scientific and medical affairs at Astellas Pharma U.S. Inc., the Northbrook-based subsidiary of Japanese drug-maker Astellas Pharma Inc.Hospira CEO F. Michael Ball revealed the new hires last week during a conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter earnings.The new employees are among six high-level executives that Mr. Ball has hired in recent months as the company works on product safety problems that have led to lower production and recalls.“I think we've transformed the team here into a team that can really move this company forward,” Mr. Ball told analysts, according to a transcript.Mr. Ball welcomed Mr. Ryding by name during the conference call, noting that he is filling a newly created role.Mr. Ryding has more than 35 years of operations and management experience, according to his biography on Hospira's website.

He started his career at London-based Rolls-Royce Aero-Engines PLC.During the conference call, Mr. Ball disclosed that the company had filled the other positions. The names of the new employees were supplied by a Hospira spokeswoman.Hospira has hired several other key executives since the beginning of the year to help turn the company around.Ms. Skeens left Baxter in April after working for the company for about 20 years, a company spokeswoman confirmed.A spokeswoman for Astellas confirmed that Dr. Bukofzer left the company for Hospira but did not know how long he worked there.

Stan Bukofzer: Biosimilars promise health care savings, treatment options to Illinois residents



Saturday
Nov 1, 2014 at 10:02 PM








In Illinois, nearly 282,000 people suffer from critical conditions that are treated by complex drugs known as biologics � drugs typically made of proteins that have been generated inside a living organism. These drugs have had a major impact, treating illnesses including cancer, chronic kidney disease and auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.But biologics are expensive and can cost up to $100,000 per year per patient. As biologic use increases, the cost to the U.S. health care system is swelling in response. This has an adverse effect on both patients and the Illinois health care system. We need to find a way to ensure the citizens of Illinois have access to the medicines and treatment options they need without breaking the bank. Enter biosimilars. A biosimilar is a biological product that is proven to be just as safe and effective as an originator biologic drug and offers cost savings. Biosimilars are a new class of drug in the United States, possible now only as biologic patents expire. These drugs are less costly because they are less expensive to develop and require less development time than originator biologics. Illinois needs biosimilars.Illinois� lawmakers understand this need. Illinois state law governs the substitution by pharmacists of generic drugs for their branded counterparts. This pharmacy law will need to be updated to allow for the substitution of biologic products for FDA approved interchangeable biosimilars. State legislators are considering legislation that would help reduce costs by increasing access to biologic alternatives known as biosimilars. Specifically, the legislation would allow a pharmacist to substitute a biosimilar for a biologic, saving a patient significant money. Headquartered outside of Chicago in Lake Forest, Hospira is the only North American-based company currently producing and distributing biosimilars in Europe and Australia. We have developed unique insights into the impact of biosimilars, which have treated hundreds of thousands of patients. Over the next decade, the widespread availability of biosimilar drugs is projected to save the U.S. up to $250 billion. Creating a pathway for the introduction of biosimilars is essential, but it is only the first step to encourage the adoption of these medicines. Education is essential to integrating these drugs into the marketplace. Patients, providers and payers alike must understand the value these drugs bring to the state. Policymaker and provider support for biosimilars will help create trust in biosimilars, maximizing adoption, increasing accessibility and reducing costs in Illinois and across the United States.  If Illinois passes legislation, biosimilars will positively influence the cost and accessibility of a number of key biologic drugs benefiting patients across the state. Stan Bukofzer is Chief Medical Officer, Hospira Inc.
