                Most Profitable Oil and Gas Companies of 2016 (PSPX, TEP)            


    By Ryan Downie | August 17, 2016 — 10:00 AM EDT    






Share
























































Profitability can be measured in multiple ways. Net income is expressed as an absolute dollar amount, while profit margins are expressed as a percentage of revenue. Profits are also often adjusted to reflect non-recurring events, though Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have more rigid standards for profit calculation.
The midstream business model tends to allow higher margins than other portions of the energy supply chain, so large midstream pure-plays are generally the highest-margin businesses in the sector. Philips 66 Partners LP (NYSE: PSPX), Tallgrass Energy Partners LP (NYSE: TEP) and Genesis Energy LP (NYSE: GEL) have some of the highest profit margins in the business for companies that derive revenues from providing products and services. Major integrated oil and gas firms, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), produce massive profits due to their scale.
Phillips 66 Partners LP
Phillips 66 Partners is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns and operates midstream operations, such as pipeline systems that transport crude oil, liquid natural gas and refined products. Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) formed the company in 2013 to manage its pipelines, terminals and other transportation assets.
Phillips 66 Partners had a 38.4% net margin over the 12-month period that ended in June 2016, resulting in $236 million in net profits. Since 2011, the MLP's net margin has fluctuated between 51.3% and 26.5%, though it has usually fallen between 44% and 51%. Analysts are calling for 44.4% revenue growth and 13% earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2016, so margins should compress despite rising profits.
Genesis Energy LP
Genesis Energy LP is another MLP created to manage midstream assets and provide logistics services. The company has an extensive pipeline system servicing customers across diverse locations in the United States. The company's net margin was 23.8% over the 12-month period that ended in June 2016, though this was the highest level achieved in the past decade. Net income of $871 million is also the highest for any 12-month period over the 10-year span. Analyst forecasts call for 58% EPS expansion for the full year 2016 despite contraction on the top line, so both profits and margins should rise in 2016 for Genesis.
Tallgrass Energy Partners LP
Tallgrass Energy Partners is another MLP that owns and operates midstream assets, generating most of its revenue from transportation services. It also generates a smaller portion of revenue from selling oil and natural gas products and processing services. Tallgrass had a 19.9% net margin over the 12-month period that ended in June 2016, resulting in $172 of net income. Net margin has been as high as 25.2% in 2011 and as low as 2.6% in 2013, but it has generally stayed between 15% and 25%. Analysts forecast 19.2% sales growth and 22.2% EPS growth in 2016, so both profits and margins are expected to rise.
Exxon Mobil
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. energy company in terms of market cap, revenues and volume produced. The company's impressive scale leads to exceptionally high profits, though the business model leads to substantially lower margins than those enjoyed by midstream firms. This has been especially true in 2016, when crude oil prices approached their lowest levels in roughly a decade. Exxon Mobil managed 4.51% net margin over the 12 months ended June 2016, which is the lowest level of the past decade. Net margin was as high as 10.5% during that span. Despite this dip, Exxon Mobil still generated $10.5 billion in net profits. EPS is expected to fall 35.4% year-over-year in 2016 as low energy prices wreak havoc on earnings, but similar pain is being felt by other firms across the sector.
Chevron
Chevron is the second-largest U.S. diversified oil and gas company, and it is influenced by the same fundamental drivers as Exxon Mobil. The company's 1% net margin over the 12 months that ended in June 2016 was the lowest of the past decade, during which time margins often fell between 8% and 10%. This precipitous fall still yielded $1.3 billion in net profits, and analysts are forecasting improvements in the second half of 2016.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P.: Buy the Dip?
After a big run leading into 2016, Enterprise Products Partners is off around 10% from its high. Should you be buying this dip?











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jun 20, 2017 at 11:18AM
            
            





Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is one of the largest oil and natural gas midstream partnerships in the country, and its shares have fallen roughly 10% since hitting a peak in February. Is it time for you to start adding this industry giant to your portfolio? The numbers say yes; here are six things you need to know before you pull the trigger.
1. Scale
Enterprise is one of the largest midstream companies in the United States. That means growth will be slower than at a smaller industry player, but it also means the partnership can take on deals and projects that not many of its peers could handle. So, scale has its advantages. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Enterprise is also one of the most diversified midstream names, partially a function of its size. It owns pipelines, storage facilities, products terminals, processing plants, and even a fleet of ships. It has assets spread across a huge swatch of the country. That means if one product it moves or regional area is under pressure, Enterprise has the flexibility to adjust its business to deal with the issue.  
2. Throughput, not commodities
The vast majority of Enterprise's business is fee-based. This point isn't unique to Enterprise. For example, Holly Energy Partners gets 100% of its revenues from fees. But it is still an important reason for owning Enterprise. Essentially, a fee-based business means that the price of oil and natural gas has a limited impact on Enterprise's business. Demand is a much more important determinant of success. 
To give you an idea of what this means, oil prices tumbled in mid-2014 and still hadn't fully recovered by year end 2016. But over that span, Enterprise's core distributable cash flow grew from $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. That's not amazing growth, but it happened at a time when oil prices fell from over $100 a barrel to around $30 at the worst point. Withstanding that kind of price drop highlights the value of Enterprise's business model... even if it isn't unique.

3. Buying growth
Another benefit of Enterprise's size is that it allows the midstream giant to make big moves in down markets. For example, it completed the acquisition of its oil tankers business in early 2015 while oil prices were still falling. And more recently it bought the midstream assets of Azure Midstream Partners at a bankruptcy auction. Both show Enterprise's ability to expand its business opportunistically in downturns so it can come out the other side a stronger company. 
Of course downturns aren't the only time it expands this way. But the ability to take a contrarian stance is a key differentiating factor. That said, to give you a broader sense of the company's history, Enterprise has spent $26 billion on acquisitions since its initial public offering in 1998. 
4. A builder
While acquisitions are an important piece of the growth equation for Enterprise, it isn't the only thing to watch. Construction is another key avenue for growth. On that front, the partnership has $8.4 billion of growth projects in the works between now and 2019.  

Enterprise is building its business from the ground up. Image Source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. IMAGE: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NjczMTU0fENoaWxkSUQ9MzgwOTQ1fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1 page 33

Size is important here, too, because Enterprise can comfortably take on projects that smaller peers don't have the scale to get done. In fact, Enterprise has spent around $38 billion on organic growth projects since it came public, far more than it's spent on acquisitions.  





5. Good quarter
That said, you might be asking what's going on today at Enterprise... Motley Fool's Tyler Crowe recently highlighted the good news here. In the first quarter, Enterprise saw nice jumps in net income, earnings, and distributable cash flow year over year and sequentially compared to the fourth quarter. All three had been in something of a holding pattern during the oil downturn, with new assets offsetting slow demand for existing assets.  
With drilling activity picking up in the United States, however, Enterprise's expansion efforts are really starting to show results. Assuming this trend continues the partnership should have a pretty good year.
6. Distribution
All of this leads to a discussion of the partnership's distribution, which is likely what attracted you to Enterprise in the first place. For starters, it offers a robust 6.2% distribution yield. That's toward the high end of its historical range. The distribution was covered by 1.3 times in the first quarter, which provides plenty of safety and room for future increases.  
Note that the distribution was increased by 5% in the quarter, marking the 51st consecutive quarter in which Enterprise has upped the disbursement. However, the longer streak is 20 -- the number of consecutive years that Enterprise has increased its distribution. If you like dividend increases, Enterprise has you covered.  





Would there be a bad time to buy?
All in, Enterprise is likely among the best-run participants in the oil and natural gas midstream industry. In fact, some might argue that there's never a bad time to buy this limited partnership for long-term investors seeking income (that's hyperbole, of course). But today, after a 10% pullback, is certainly not a bad time. With a well-covered 6.2% distribution yield and two decades worth of dividend growth behind it, investors would be well served to do a deep dive here.

Risk Factors to consider when investing in MLPs:

Cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with the MLP's operating or business performance.
MLPs typically have a General Partner that maintains an aggregate 2% General Partner interest. Unit holders will have limited voting rights and do not own an interest in, vote with, or control the General Partner. The General Partner often cannot be removed without its own consent, and the General Partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of unit holders.
The MLP may issue additional common units, diluting existing unit holders’ interests.
Unit holders may be required to pay taxes on income from the MLP even if they do not receive cash distributions.
The IRS could reclassify the MLP as a taxable entity, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to unit holders.
If at any time the GP owns 85% or more of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests, the GP will have the right to purchase all of the limited partnership interests not held by the GP at a price that may be undesirable.


MLP Tax Considerations: The tax treatment for investors in MLPs is different than that of an investment in stock, including (a) the investor's share of the MLP's income, deductions and expenses are reported on Schedule K-1, not Form 1099, (b) because of the possibility of unrelated business taxable income, charitable remainder trusts should not invest in this strategy, and other non-taxable investors (such as ERISA and IRA accounts) should carefully consider whether to invest in this strategy, (c) investors may have to file income tax returns in states in which the MLP's do business and (d) MLP tax information is sent directly from the partnership which generally has until April 15th to provide this information. You should discuss these and any other tax implications with your tax advisor.

Expect The Rebound To Continue For NGL Energy Partners - NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NGL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Expect The Rebound To Continue For NGL Energy PartnersJul. 4.17 | About: NGL Energy (NGL) Logan Duvall Contrarian, REITs, dividend growth investing, oil & gasSowing ProsperitySummaryEven with NGL's recent rally, it still looks like a good time to invest.NGL is well positioned for the future and is likely to be a highly profitable investment.There is potential for 30% gains over a 2-year period.Without an overload of information, I will portray facts and reasons for investing in NGL Energy Partners LP (NGL). The past couple of months have been horrid for investors because of the significant drop in price has occurred, but moving ahead, there are reasons to be optimistic. Business Overview NGL Energy Partners LP purchases propane, butane, and other natural gas liquids from refiners, processing plants, producers, and other parties, and sells the product to retailers, refiners, and other participants in wholesale markets. NGL is a Master Limited Partnership (or MLP) with a diverse group of growing businesses, which pays a quarterly dividend of 39 cents. NGL has 5 business groups - Water Solutions, Retail Propane, Crude Logistics, Liquids, and Refined Products. NGL provides services for the energy industry and generally is paid on a fixed-fee basis. However, in some segments - especially Liquids, Refined Products, and Retail Propane - NGL takes title to products and resells them at a markup. 

 

Source for both charts Summary from latest annual report 2017  Total stockholders' equity: 2.23 billion. Market Cap is 1.8 billion (the last price of the stock was 14.65). NGL Energy Partners LP purchases propane, butane, and other natural gas liquids from refiners, processing plants, producers, and other parties, and sells the product to retailers, refiners, and other participants in wholesale markets. Total stockholders' equity has increased from 1.69 billion in 2016 to 2.23 billion in 2017. NGL has 12.26 million in cash (from latest annual report). In 2017, the company has 2.96 billion in long-term debt, and short-term debt is 30 million. (In 2016, the company had 2.91 billion in long-term debt, and short-term debt was 8 million). The company's revenue increased in 2017 (fiscal year ends in March) to 13.02 billion from 11.74 billion in 2016. Net income in 2017 was 137 million; net loss in 2016 was 386 million. NGL Energy Partners has spent 182 million on dividends in 2017. NGL currently pays $1.56 in distributions per year for a yield of 11.14%; 2018 is certainly going to be better than fiscal 2017. According to analysts, NGL should increase its distribution to at least 44 cents per quarter ($1.76 per year). The 11.14% dividend is covered and the growth projects ensure that the numbers will be moving up in fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 will be better because the fiscal year 2017 did not include the full earnings power of the Grand Mesa and Murphy Oil acquisitions. For FY 2018, NGL expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $500M-$525M, including $130M EBITDA for the Grand Mesa Pipeline; FY 2018 CAPEX is projected at $150M-$200M. 
 

Source NGL Energy Partners LP Preferred NGL Energy Partners LP has just issued a preferred stock. The stock will be 9.00% Class B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units. The Preferred Unit trades as NGL-B and currently trades slightly below par at $24.87. Dividend I expect NGL to go ex-dividend around the first of August with a 0.39 cent dividend; a yield currently at a little over 11%. Opinion about the company Fundamentally, I believe NGL to be a good company, and in the future, we can expect promising growth. The fourth quarter ending March 31, 2017, was extremely weak. An abnormally warm winter led to a decrease in propane sales. The majority of investors expected a dividend increase in 2017, but that now looks unlikely. After the weak fourth quarter and lack of a dividend increase, the unit price declined from the low $20s to a low of $11.50. The last two weeks have seen a steady increase to a close of $14.65 on July 3rd. 

NGL data by YCharts Taxes NGL issues a K-1, which many investors despise. Such securities are usually recommended to be held in a taxable account. This is definitely something to discuss with a tax advisor; I am not one. Risks Among the key risk factors that may affect their consolidated financial position and results are the prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, gasoline, diesel, ethanol, and even biodiesel. Energy prices, in general, will have an effect.
 NGL has a substantial amount of total debt, partly including inventory, but I expect them to be able to reduce their debt gradually. There is a high probability that another drop in share price could occur. If you are reading this, you are probably aware this is a volatile time in the oil and gas sector. Propane is also a large factor for NGL. 

USO data by YCharts Technical analysis When we take a look at the three-year chart, we can see that the price dropped from $25 to under $12 and started to rise (we can see a strong "downtrend" which has been broken). On this chart, I marked resistance and support levels. The support levels of $12 and $16 represent resistance. If the price jumps above $16, it would be a "BUY" signal and the price could easily rise to $20. Rising above $16 supports the continuation of a bullish trend overview efficiently for the upcoming period. If the price falls below $12, it would be a strong "SELL" signal and the price could easily drop to $10. 

 Source Conclusion My opinion is that NGL is well positioned for the future and is likely to be a highly profitable investment. NGL currently pays $1.56 in distributions per year for a yield of 11.14%, and 2018 is certainly going to be better than fiscal 2017. It wouldn't surprise me if NGL increases its distribution to at least 44 cents per quarter ($1.76 per year) next year. The 11.14% dividend is covered and the growth projects ensure that the numbers will be moving up in fiscal 2018.
 NGL reported FQ4 earnings and revenues, the latter rising 65% Y/Y to $3.85B vs. the ~$2.5B analyst consensus. NGL says adjusted EBITDA totaled $121M for Q4 and $380.8M for FY 2017, lower than the $154M for Q4 2016 and $424M for FY 2016. For FY 2018, NGL expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $500M-$525M, including $130M EBITDA for the Grand Mesa Pipeline (this pipeline is projected to make $10-12 million per month in EBITDA). At its current price, NGL is an excellent long-term investment with a very generous yield and solid growth prospects. If the price falls, any price in the range of $12 to $14 is an excellent opportunity to invest in NGL, and investors could certainly earn at least 30% within the next two years.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer is a Texas-based company that began in 1995 as a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator and is now one of the largest and most diversified investment grade master limited partnerships in the United States. Growing from roughly 200 miles of natural gas pipelines in 2002 to more than 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined products, and crude oil pipelines today, the Energy Transfer family of partnerships remains dedicated to providing exceptional service to its customers and attractive returns to its investors.
Through several transformative transactions, we have expanded our scope of services. While we remain committed to the natural gas industry, we enhanced our diversified portfolio of assets by making a strategic entrance into the NGL business through the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus’ NGL storage, fractionation and transportation operations in 2011. In 2012, we acquired Southern Union Company, a leading diversified natural gas company, which expanded our national footprint and added more than 20,000 miles of gathering and transportation pipelines to our portfolio. We made a strong entrance into the crude oil and refined products business by acquiring Sunoco, Inc. in 2012, including its interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. 
(NYSE: SXL). Lastly, through the merger with Regency Energy Partners in 2015, we significantly diversified our footprint, both geographically and across business lines. We expanded our reach in the refined products and convenience store business with the acquisition of Susser Holdings Corporation, including its interest in Susser Petroleum Partners LP, 
(now Sunoco LP - NYSE: SUN). In April 2017, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners merged, with the combined company now called Energy Transfer Partners, creating one of the largest MLPs by Enterprise Value with a fully integrated midstream/liquids platform. These acquisitions, together with our already robust asset base, have enabled Energy Transfer to become a premier provider of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and refined products.
Today, there are four publicly traded partnerships in the Energy Transfer Family.

Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETP) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. Strategically positioned in all of the major U.S. production basins, ETP owns and operates a geographically diverse portfolio of complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets; crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and refined product transportation and terminalling assets; NGL fractionation; and various acquisition and marketing assets.  ETP’s general partner is owned by Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETE).
 For more information, visit the Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. website at

Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 
(NYSE: ETE) is a master limited partnership that owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
(NYSE: ETP) and Sunoco LP 
(NYSE: SUN).  ETE also owns Lake Charles LNG Company. On a consolidated basis, ETE's family of companies owns and operates a diverse portfolio of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil pipelines, as well as retail and wholesale motor fuel operations and LNG terminalling.
