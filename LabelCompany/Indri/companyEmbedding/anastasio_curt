SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NuStar Energy L.P. (NYSE: NS) announced today that Curt Anastasio, 
      President and CEO of NuStar Energy L.P. and NuStar GP Holdings, plans to 
      retire from the company effective December 31, 2013. The company’s board 
      of directors has selected Brad Barron, NuStar’s Executive Vice President 
      and General Counsel, to assume the position of President and CEO upon 
      Anastasio’s retirement.
    


      Since Anastasio became CEO in 2001 when the company went public, NuStar 
      has grown from 160 employees to 1,800; from $387 million in assets to 
      $5.6 billion; and from $99 million in revenues to $6 billion. “Thanks to 
      Curt’s hard work and dedication, working alongside our employees, we 
      have grown from a regional pipeline operator to become a global FORTUNE 
      500 company that’s one of the largest independent liquids terminal and 
      pipeline operators in the nation,” said Bill Greehey, NuStar’s Chairman 
      of the Board.
    

      “We all owe him a huge debt of gratitude for leading our company during 
      a period of tremendous growth, making NuStar one of the best places to 
      work in corporate America, and making our communities better places to 
      live and work,” said Greehey. “His more than a decade of leadership as 
      NuStar’s CEO was marked by many extraordinary successes. While the last 
      few years have been challenging, Curt continually looked out for all of 
      our stakeholders. It was no easy task, but he led the company out of 
      some very big challenges without any layoffs, while maintaining NuStar’s 
      unique caring and sharing culture, and successfully working to get total 
      unitholder value up more than 34 percent this year. And Brad’s 
      experience and skill sets make him uniquely qualified to step in and 
      lead NuStar into the future. I have worked closely with him for a number 
      of years, and I am confident in his business judgment and leadership 
      skills. He is bright, personable and hard-working, and the board has 
      great confidence that he can drive the success of the organization to 
      new heights,” he said.
    

      Anastasio explained that he’s ready to begin the next chapter of his 
      life saying, “After 12 years as NuStar’s CEO, my wife and I are looking 
      forward to spending more time with our children and other family 
      members, who mostly live in the northeast and on the East Coast,” said 
      Anastasio. “But I love San Antonio and plan to remain involved in our 
      community. I will continue serving the San Antonio community and our 
      state through my board work for the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar 
      County, the Alamo Area Council of the Boy Scouts, the San Antonio 
      Medical Foundation and The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
    

      “I have been proud to be a part of NuStar and to work with the best and 
      brightest employees in our industry. And I plan to continue to be a 
      NuStar investor because I am confident that our employees will execute 
      our many important growth projects with excellence, and will continue to 
      make NuStar a shining example of what a great company should mean to its 
      employees, communities and unitholders,” he said.
    

      Barron praised Anastasio saying, “No one has worked harder or cared more 
      for NuStar and its employees or the community than Curt. In addition to 
      the tremendous growth and success that NuStar achieved during his years 
      as CEO, Curt also grew the unique culture, for which NuStar is known. I 
      am looking forward to working with our board, leadership team and 
      employees to build on NuStar’s success in the years to come,” said 
      Barron.
    

      Greehey noted that the board selected Barron because they believe he has 
      the drive, dedication and leadership skills to motivate and inspire 
      NuStar’s employees to achieve tremendous success going forward. “Brad 
      has sound insight, is a good negotiator and a great consensus builder. 
      He works well with individuals in all areas of the company and is known 
      for moving the ball forward, while maintaining high morale and 
      camaraderie,” said Greehey.
    

      Barron has more than 20 years of experience, and he began his career 
      with NuStar 12 years ago. He has served as NuStar’s General Counsel for 
      over six years and based on his many contributions to the company’s 
      success, he was promoted to Executive Vice President in 2012. Prior to 
      joining NuStar, Barron served as Managing Counsel of Valero Energy 
      Corporation, and he started his career with Vinson & Elkins LLP.
    

      In addition to his work overseeing all of NuStar’s governance, 
      contractual issues and legal defenses, Barron has also overseen Human 
      Resources in the past and works closely with the company’s Financial and 
      Corporate Development groups on all mergers and acquisitions. 
      Additionally, he oversees the Right of Way and Health, Safety & 
      Environmental departments so he has worked closely with the company’s 
      Operations, Engineering and Business Development groups.
    

NuStar’s Success During Anastasio’s Tenure


      Under Anastasio’s leadership, the company has made FORTUNE magazine’s 
      list of The 100 Best Companies to Work For every year since it was first 
      eligible to participate, with its highest ranking coming in at No. 15. 
      It also has been continuously ranked as a top employer by the San 
      Antonio Express-News, as well as through media competitions in Corpus 
      Christi, TX; Wichita, KS; Baltimore, MD; Paulsboro, NJ; and Sacramento, 
      CA.
    

      Also during Anastasio’s tenure, NuStar was named one of America’s Most 
      Trustworthy Companies by Forbes magazine; ranked No. 1 among large 
      companies for growth by the San Antonio Business Journal; and recognized 
      as the second fastest-growing energy company in the Americas by Platts. 
      For its community service initiatives, NuStar was honored with the 
      Volunteer of the Year Award by the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar 
      County and named the Outstanding Philanthropic Corporation in San 
      Antonio by the local chapter of the Association of Fundraising 
      Professionals.
    

      With safety as the company’s top priority, NuStar has maintained one of 
      the best safety records in its industry as its lost-time incident rate 
      and total recordable injury rate have been significantly better 
      than the industry averages. It also has 16 locations designated as VPP 
      Star Sites in OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program, one of the most 
      rigorous and stringent voluntary safety programs.
    

      Anastasio said he was most proud of NuStar’s caring and sharing culture 
      that has resulted in record contributions of time and money to its 
      communities. NuStar and its employees pledged $2.6 million to the 2013 
      United Way campaign, with 99% participation companywide and 100% in San 
      Antonio. The company’s employees also raised nearly $20 million to 
      support Haven for Hope, San Antonio’s homeless transformation campus 
      that is being called a national model in the fight against homelessness, 
      and they volunteered 90,000 hours of volunteer time to various nonprofit 
      organizations in 2012.

      For its community service initiatives, NuStar was honored with the 
      Volunteer of the Year Award by the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar 
      County and named the Outstanding Philanthropic Corporation in San 
      Antonio by the local chapter of the Association of Fundraising 
      Professionals.
    

      With safety as the company’s top priority, NuStar has maintained one of 
      the best safety records in its industry as its lost-time incident rate 
      and total recordable injury rate have been significantly better 
      than the industry averages. It also has 16 locations designated as VPP 
      Star Sites in OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program, one of the most 
      rigorous and stringent voluntary safety programs.
    

      Anastasio said he was most proud of NuStar’s caring and sharing culture 
      that has resulted in record contributions of time and money to its 
      communities. NuStar and its employees pledged $2.6 million to the 2013 
      United Way campaign, with 99% participation companywide and 100% in San 
      Antonio. The company’s employees also raised nearly $20 million to 
      support Haven for Hope, San Antonio’s homeless transformation campus 
      that is being called a national model in the fight against homelessness, 
      and they volunteered 90,000 hours of volunteer time to various nonprofit 
      organizations in 2012.
