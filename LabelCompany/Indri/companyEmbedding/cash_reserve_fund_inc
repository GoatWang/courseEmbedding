CREDIT SUISSE CASH RESERVE FUND

ANNUAL INVESTMENT ADVISER'S REPORT


December 31, 2001


January 29, 2002


Dear Shareholder:


The January-through-December period was one of considerable uncertainty for
investors. The economy continued to weaken, resulting in ongoing
corporate-profit disappointments. In an attempt to spur growth, the Federal
Reserve began lowering interest rates in January.


The latter part of the period was extraordinary. Stocks plunged in the
immediate wake of the September terrorist attacks, but then rallied through the
fourth quarter as the Fed stepped up its easing campaign and as success on the
war front lessened risk worries.


In the end, most major equity indexes finished the year with significant
losses, while bonds (at least high-quality bonds) performed well. In this
environment, money market asset flows were volatile. Demand for short-term
securities was often high, with investors seeking safety and liquidity when
uncertainty rose. On the other hand, investors were sometimes quick to exit
money market funds in response to encouraging economic news. Credit Suisse Cash
Reserve Fund(1) (the "Fund") had total net assets of about $301.5 million on
December 31, 2001, compared with about $343.6 million at the start of the
period.


Our general strategy through the period was to attempt to lock in higher
yields farther out on the yield curve, in the belief (correct, as it turned out)
that the Fed would continue to lower rates. The Fund's average weighted maturity
was 44 days as of December 31, 2001, up from 37 days a year earlier. The Fund's
annualized yield for the seven-day period ended December 31, 2001 was 1.66%
(with waivers and reimbursements).


As we look ahead, we believe that we are at or very close to the bottom of
the interest-rate cycle, as the Fed has hinted. We are therefore likely to shift
in favor of shorter-maturity securities at some point, in order to have more
flexibility to act when and if short-term rates begin to rise. On the other
hand, the yield curve for money market securities has remained relatively steep,
and at present we remain focused on longer-term securities. We will continue to
monitor economic and market trends very carefully.


The Fund will remain focused on high-quality securities in order to attempt
to provide competitive returns without compromising safety or stability of
principal. We appreciate your continued support and investment in the Fund.

CREDIT SUISSE NEW YORK TAX EXEMPT FUND

ANNUAL INVESTMENT ADVISER'S REPORT


December 31, 2001


January 29, 2002


Dear Shareholder:


We are pleased to present the annual report for Credit Suisse New York Tax
Exempt Fund covering the year ended December 31, 2001.


The impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the onset of an
economic recession has affected the economy of New York and the country as a
whole. New York State and New York City have been particularly affected, and are
facing budget constraints and increased unemployment rates. These factors, among
others, and the performance of the fund are discussed in detail in the letter
below from the fund's sub-investment adviser, BlackRock Institutional Management
Corporation. We will continue to focus on providing investors with a high level
of current interest income, in accordance with the fund's objective, in the
current interest rate and economic environment.


We hope you find this report helpful. Thank you for your continued confidence
and support.


James P. McCaughan

Chairman


The onset of a recession, combined with the tragedy of September 11th, has
impacted the U.S. economy and especially that of New York. Economic growth in
New York ceased after September 11th. New York State's unemployment has grown to
5.8% in December 2001, up from 5.5% in November and at its highest level since
March 1998. Private sector employment has lost approximately 95,100 jobs since
September 2001. Most of the job losses are concentrated in New York City. While
the state benefits from its broad and diverse economic base and its substantial
wealth and resources, the impact on the state's budget has been substantial. The
state will use up the $1.6 billion surplus from fiscal year 2001 to meet its
budgetary needs during fiscal year 2002. It is projected that the state will
close fiscal year 2002 with a $3 billion deficit, and will need to close a
potential $6 billion deficit in fiscal year 2003. A fiscally sound budget
produced in a relatively timely manner will likely be necessary in order for the
state to maintain its AA rating from S&P.


2





The state's fiscal health is directly linked to that of New York City. The
demise of the World Trade Center and the devastation to lower Manhattan has
impacted and can be expected to continue to impact the city's business
structure. New York City has lost approximately 94,700 jobs since September 11th
and has seen its unemployment rate grow to 7.0% in December 2001, up from 5.0%
in July 2001. The city projects that it will close fiscal year 2002 in balance.
Fiscal year 2003 will probably present the city with a greater challenge, with a
$3.6 billion budget gap currently being projected. This uncertainty has prompted
Moody's to change the outlook on New York City's A2 rating to "negative."


During the second half of the year, the Federal Open Market Committee eased
rates an additional 200 basis points for a total of 475 basis points of easing
during 2001. The horrible events that took place on September 11th were the
driving force behind the aggressive easing in the second half of the year, as
175 basis points of easing occurred after September 11th.


Assets for Credit Suisse New York Tax Exempt Fund(1) closed the year ended
December 31, 2001 at $186.7 million. With the continued aggressive easing stance
taken by the Federal Reserve during the second half of the year, the Fund
continued to look for what it considered to be attractive opportunities to
invest further out the yield curve. The Fund was able to increase its position
in several attractively priced short bonds and general market notes. On December
31st the average weighted maturity of the Fund stood at 39 days, the 7-day
annualized yield was 1.24% (with waivers and reimbursements) and the one year
return was 2.13%.


The Fund seeks to continue to provide investors with a high level of current
interest income exempt from federal, New York State and New York City personal
income taxes as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity. We
appreciate your continued support and investment in the Fund.

THE INTEREST ON NEW YORK MUNICIPAL OBLIGATION IS EXCLUDABLE FROM GROSS INCOME
FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND EXEMPT FROM NEW YORK STATE AND NEW YORK CITY
PERSONAL INCOME TAXES. A PORTION OF INCOME MAY BE SUBJECT TO STATE, LOCAL AND
CITY TAXES OR THE FEDERAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.


THIS FUND MAY BE RISKIER THAN A MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY-DIVERSE MUNICIPAL
MONEY-MARKET FUND. ADDITIONALLY, THE RISK OF A DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY,
PARTICULARLY IN NEW YORK CITY AND NEW YORK STATE, HAS BEEN HEIGHTENED BY THE
TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. IT IS LIKELY
THAT NEW YORK CITY AND NEW YORK STATE WILL SUFFER FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AS A
RESULT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF NEW YORK MUNICIPAL ISSUERS
TO MAKE PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, AS WELL AS THE CREDIT RATING, MARKET
VALUE AND YIELD OF SECURITIES OF SUCH ISSUERS. IF THE FUND HAS DIFFICULTY
FINDING ATTRACTIVE NEW YORK MUNICIPAL SECURITIES TO PURCHASE, THE AMOUNT OF THE
FUND'S INCOME THAT IS SUBJECT TO NEW YORK TAXES COULD INCREASE.

CREDIT SUISSE CASH RESERVE AND NEW YORK TAX EXEMPT FUNDS






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


December 31, 2001






NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



The Credit Suisse Cash Reserve Fund, formerly the Warburg Pincus Cash
Reserve Fund, ("Cash Reserve") and Credit Suisse New York Tax Exempt Fund,
formerly the Warburg Pincus New York Tax Exempt Fund, ("New York Tax Exempt")
(each, a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as open-end management investment
companies.


The investment objective of the Cash Reserve Fund is to provide investors
with high current income consistent with liquidity and stability of principal.
The investment objective of the New York Tax Exempt Fund is to provide investors
with as high a level of current interest income exempt from federal, New York
state and New York City personal income taxes as is consistent with preservation
of capital and liquidity.


Each Fund offers Common Class and Class A shares. Each class of shares in
each Fund represents an equal pro rata interest in each Fund, except that they
bear different expenses, which reflect the difference in the range of services
provided to them. Common Class shares of each Fund bear no class specific
expenses. Class A shares of each Fund bear expenses paid pursuant to a plan of
distribution at an annual rate of .25% of the average daily net asset value of
each Fund's Class A shares.


New York State and New York City have at times faced serious economic
problems that have adversely affected New York municipal issuers. The default or
credit-rating downgrade of one of these issuers could affect the market value
and marketability of New York municipal securities and hurt New York Tax
Exempt's yield or share price. As a result, the Fund may be riskier than a more
geographically diversified municipal money-market fund.


A) SECURITY VALUATION -- The net asset value of each Fund is determined
twice daily as of noon and the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. Each Fund's investments are valued under the amortized cost
method, which has been determined by the Funds' Board of Directors to represent
the fair value of the Funds' investments. The Board of Directors has established
procedures which include review by the Board of Directors, at such intervals as
it deems appropriate, to determine the extent, if any, to which the Fund's net
asset value per share calculated by using available market quotations deviates
from $1.00 per share. In the event such deviation exceeds 1/2 of 1%, the Board
of Directors will promptly consider what action, if any, should be initiated.
Amortized cost involves valuing a Fund holding initially at its cost and then
assumes a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium. The
amortized cost method ignores any impact of fluctuating interest rates.


B) SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME -- Security transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. Interest income is recorded


19





on the accrual basis. The cost of investments sold is determined by use of the
specific identification method for both financial reporting and income tax
purposes.


C) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS -- Dividends from net
investment income are declared daily and paid monthly. Distributions of net
realized capital gains, if any, are generally declared and paid annually,
although Cash Reserve may declare and pay short-term capital gains, if any,
periodically as the Board of Directors determines. However, to the extent that a
net realized capital gain can be reduced by a capital loss carryover, such gain
will not be distributed. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").


D) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES -- No provision is made for federal taxes as it is
each Fund's intention to continue to qualify for and elect the tax treatment
applicable to regulated investment companies under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and make the requisite distributions to its shareholders which
will be sufficient to relieve it from federal income and excise taxes.


E) USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


F) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- Each Fund may enter into repurchase agreements.
Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, a Fund acquires a security
subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase. Securities pledged as
collateral for repurchase agreements are held by the Fund's custodian bank until
the agreements mature. Each agreement requires that the market value of the
collateral be sufficient to cover payment of interest and principal; however in
the event of default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement,
retention of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

NOTE 4. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES



Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with
federal income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences
are primarily due to differing treatments of losses deferred due to wash sales,
and excise tax regulations.


Cash Reserve and New York Tax Exempt had $12,947,638 and $3,973,090 in
distributions, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2001, which were
classified as ordinary income for tax purposes.


At December 31, 2001, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:








                                                                                            NEW YORK

                                                                        ------------       ----------
Undistributed ordinary income                                            $       --        $       --
Capital loss carryovers                                                     (81,308)           (3,696)
                                                                         ----------        ----------
                                                                         $  (81,308)       $   (3,696)
                                                                         ==========        ==========








At December 31, 2001, Cash Reserve and New York Tax Exempt had capital loss
carryovers available to offset possible future capital gains of $81,308 and
$3,696 expiring in 2006 and 2009, respectively. During the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2001, Cash Reserve utilized $43,591 of capital losses.


24





At December 31, 2001, capital contributions, and accumulated net realized
gain (loss) from investments have been adjusted for current period permanent
book/tax differences. New York Tax Exempt reclassified $188 of expired capital
loss carryover from accumulated net realized gain (loss) from investments to
capital contributions. Net investment income, net realized gain (loss) on
investments and net assets were not affected by these
reclassifications.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Credit Suisse Cash Reserve Fund, Inc. and
Credit Suisse New York Tax Exempt Fund, Inc.:


In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities,
including the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Credit Suisse Cash Reserve Fund,
Inc. and Credit Suisse New York Tax Exempt Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") at
December 31, 2001, the results of each of their operations for the year then
ended, the changes in each of their net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the years (or
periods) presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Funds' management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2001 by correspondence with the custodian provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The 365-yield represents standard one-day yield for the funds. The 30-day simple yield represents annualized results for the period, net of fees and expenses and exclude any realized capital gains or losses.
Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The 365-yield represents standard one-day yield for the funds.  The 30-day simple yield represents annualized results for the period, net of fees and expenses and exclude any realized capital gains or losses.




You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


Cash Reserve Class shares are sold without an initial sales charge and are not subject to a contingent deferred sales charge; however, they are subject to other fees and expenses described in the prospectus.


Effective June 28, 2016, the Invesco Money Market Fund was renamed the Invesco Government Money Market Fund and its investment strategy changed from a prime to government money market fund.


On June 28, 2016, the fund's investment strategy changed from prime to government money market fund. Results prior to June 28, 2016 reflect the performance of the fund's previous strategy. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements.


Average annual total returns reflect reinvested distributions, net of expenses for the periods. The 7-day SEC yield more closely reflects the current earning of the fund than the total returns.
