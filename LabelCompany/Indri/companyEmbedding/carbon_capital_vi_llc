ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC

In October 2008, Energy Capital announced the formation of ADA Carbon Solutions (“ACS”) to develop and construct an activated carbon (“AC”) production facility in Coushatta, Louisiana.


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








ACS was formed in anticipation of federal and state regulations requiring mercury removal from coal-fired power plant emissions. ACS designed and built what Energy Capital believes is the largest, most automated and most environmentally friendly AC manufacturing plant in North America focused on mitigating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The facility, which is called Red River, was completed in 2010, can produce 150 million pounds per year of AC and has begun shipping product to utility customers. In addition, ACS developed its own dedicated source of raw material, the Five Forks Mine, located in close proximity to the Red River plant.
 
In December 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) released its final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”), which set stringent new federal limits on hazardous emissions from the nation’s coal and oil-fired power plants. After a few delays, the rule went into full effect for all U.S. coal plants in April 2016.
 
For more information about ADA Carbon Solutions, please visit the company’s website at www.ADA-CS.com.






























Alaska Midstream

In July 2014, Energy Capital completed an investment commitment to Furie Operating Alaska, LLC  (“Furie”), a growth-oriented independent oil & gas company, from its Mezzanine Opportunities Fund. This investment funded the build-out of infrastructure for the installation of an offshore natural gas production platform, marine pipeline, and onshore production facilities to bring proven natural gas reserves to market from Furie’s Kitchen Lights Unit in the Cook Inlet (“KLU”).


Midstream Oil & Gas


Current








The offshore platform was the first new Cook Inlet production platform installed since 2000, when the Osprey platform was installed at the Redoubt Shoal field. The KLU infrastructure allows Furie to bring a newly discovered natural gas field online to diversify supply for the Kenai Peninsula, Mat-Su Valley and Anchorage areas. Going forward, Furie plans to continue its exploration and development program in the Kitchen Lights Unit, which is an 83,000-acre lease position.
 
For more information about Furie, please visit the company’s website at http://www.furiealaska.com/.  






























Brayton Point Power, LLC

Energy Capital purchased Brayton Point, a 1,528 MW coal-fired facility in Massachusetts. ECP acquired Brayton Point as part of a larger transaction with Dominion Resources, Inc., which closed in August 2013. The other plants in the transaction, Kincaid and Elwood, were contributed to EquiPower. The plant began commercial operations in 1963 and supplies power to ISO New England. Though Energy Capital announced plans to retire the facility in June 2017 due to a challenging long-term economic outlook for the facility, ECP closed on the sale of Brayton Point to Dynegy Inc. in April 2015.


Power Generation


Realized








Prior to sale, through a management agreement, EquiPower Resources Corp., previously an Energy Capital generation platform, acted as asset manager for Brayton Point and lent its considerable generation expertise to oversee plant activities in the areas of commercial dispatch, operations and maintenance and human resources.
 






























Broad River Power LLC

In December 2012, Energy Capital acquired Broad River, a 847 MW simple cycle, natural gas-fired power plant located in Gaffney, South Carolina. The plant began commercial operations in June 2000 and has had a strong operating history. The plant sells 100% of its output through two long-term power contracts with Carolina Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp. 


Power Generation


Realized








In October 2016, Energy Capital sold the facility to an affiliate of Arroyo Energy Investors.






























Cardinal Gas Storage Partners, LLC

In May 2008, Energy Capital Partners and Redbird Gas Storage LLC formed Cardinal Gas Storage Partners LLC, focusing on the development, construction, operation and management of natural gas storage facilities in North America. In August 2014, Energy Capital sold its interest in Cardinal to Martin Midstream.


Midstream Oil & Gas


Realized








Cardinal’s portfolio of salt cavern and depleted reservoir gas storage development projects included:
 



Arcadia
An operating salt cavern natural gas storage facility in Bienville Parish, LA.


Cadeville
An operating depleted reservoir facility in Ouachita Parish, LA.


Perryville
An operating salt cavern facility in Franklin Parish, LA.


Monroe
An operating depleted reservoir facility in Monroe County, MS; the facility was acquired by Cardinal in May 2011.

































CE2 Carbon Capital, LLC

Chieftain Sand and Proppant LLC

In July 2012, Energy Capital funded the recapitalization of Chieftain Sand from its Mezzanine Opportunities Fund. Chieftain Sand is a producer of frac sand that meets strict technical specifications for use in the oil and gas industry.


Energy Services


Current








Frac sand is required to permanently prop open factures created by the hydraulic fracturing process to unlock oil and gas from unconventional and conventional formations in North America. The majority of all domestic oil and gas drilling and development utilizes frac sand, and it is also used to improve recoveries in existing producing wells. Chieftain Sand owns and operates two frac sand production plants in Wisconsin and Arkansas.For more information about Chieftain Sand Proppant, please visit the company’s website at www.ChieftainSand.com.






























Empire Gen Holdings, Inc.

Energy Capital purchased Empire, a 635 MW combined cycle natural gas turbine (“CCGT”) power plant in Rensselaer, New York, in July 2007 during its development stage and prior to construction commencement. The plant began commercial operations in September 2010 after a successful 3 year construction period.


Power Generation


Realized

Dear President Trump, Members of the US Congress, and Global Leaders:
We, the undersigned members in the business and investor community of the United States, re-affirm our deep commitment to addressing climate change through the implementation of the historic Paris Climate Agreement.
We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions can help us achieve these objectives. Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost US competitiveness.
We pledge to do our part, in our own operations and beyond, to realize the Paris Agreement’s commitment of a global economy that limits global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
We call on our elected US leaders to strongly support:




1

Continuation of low-carbon policies to allow the US to meet or exceed our promised national commitment and to increase our nation’s future ambition


2

Investment in the low carbon economy at home and abroad in order to give financial decision-makers clarity and boost the confidence of investors worldwide


3

Continued US participation in the Paris Agreement, in order to provide the long-term direction needed to keep global temperature rise below 2°C

Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.
We support leaders around the world as they seek to implement the Paris Agreement and leverage this historic opportunity to tackle climate change.

Leading Executives are Calling for a Low Carbon USA
“It is vital that the business community demonstrates its ongoing commitment to tackling climate change,” said Barry Parkin, Chief Sustainability and Health and Wellbeing Officer at Mars Incorporated. “This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to our business and society.”
“Autodesk believes our biggest opportunity to improve our shared future is by supporting the architects, engineers, and designers who use our software to mitigate and adapt to climate change,” said Lynelle Cameron, senior director, corporate philanthropy & sustainability at Autodesk. “We also have the responsibility to reduce our direct impact on the planet, and as such, we power our facilities with 100% renewable energy. All this said, climate change cannot be solved by one country, one company, one sector, or one discipline. It is a systemic challenge that will require creativity, imagination, and innovation across the private sector, government sector, and the public at large. We’re pleased to join more than 630 companies and investors that have signed on to the most recent Business Backs Low Carbon USA calling for an energy efficient economy, powered by clean, renewable energy.”
“Thousands of employees and millions of sellers rely on eBay for their livelihoods, and that’s a responsibility we take very seriously,” said Lori Duvall, director of global impact at eBay Inc. “Part of this responsibility includes effectively responding to global climate change, both by wisely managing the carbon impacts of our business and by taking advantage of our unique opportunity to use our platform to enable a more inclusive and sustainable form of commerce, and advocating for policies to make the low carbon economy a reality.”
“Clean energy is not a partisan issue,” said Nat Kreamer, CEO of Spruce. “It creates well-paid, local jobs, drives our economy, and supports our national security. Today, solar is the largest source of new power generation in the U.S. and costs less than traditional fossil fuels in many parts of the country. That’s just one of the many reasons U.S. businesses, homeowners and communities support solar and the clean energy economy.”
“A low-carbon future benefits everyone in America and is something we should all support,” said Blake Jackson, associate at TK&A. “From a business perspective, ‘emissions = waste’, and from a quality perspective, ‘waste = dollars’. Companies and organizations who actively reduce their emissions are not only getting smarter about how they spend and use their resources, but they are also saving more, improving their products and bottom line, and are generating marketable storytelling, which fuels further patterns of environmental stewardship and positive outcomes. Whether a country or a company, we should actively lead by taking command of how we utilize resources and capital to do good to ourselves and others.”
“At Throwback Brewery, we are proof that running a low carbon business is also good for business,” said Nicole Carrier, president of Throwback Brewery. “We are the largest solar powered brewery in New Hampshire. We’ll see an ROI from our solar array in less than 3 years, with five year savings of almost 52k dollars and a 20 year savings of over 225k dollars! That’s a significant amount of cash we can use to fund other projects and to invest in our people.”
“America is a great country, known for our innovations in healthcare, technology, and more,” said Peter Krull, founder of Krull & Company. “We have the power and the knowledge to innovate when it comes to energy efficiency and climate change. Why should we sit on the sidelines while others implement solutions for their low-carbon economies? We can strengthen this great nation with energy efficiency and transitioning the economy to focus on jobs and innovation in that sector. Not only is it good business sense, it's the ethical thing to do.”
“It’s imperative that businesses take an active role in meeting the goals set out by the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Anna Walker, Senior Director of Global Policy and Advocacy at Levi Strauss & Co. “It will be critical that we work together to ensure the U.S. maintains its climate leadership, ultimately ensuring our nation’s long-term economic prosperity.” 

“With tens of billions of dollars of U.S. renewable energy investment in the works this year alone, and far more globally, the question for American political leadership is whether they want to harness this momentum and potential for economic growth," said Jonas Kron, senior vice president at Trillium Asset Management. “It is critically important to realize this is an opportunity that state policymakers can take advantage of, too, not just national leaders.”

“All parts of society have a role to play in tackling climate change, but policy and business leadership is crucial,” said Lars Petersson, president of IKEA USA. “The Paris Agreement was a bold step towards a cleaner, brighter future, and must be protected. IKEA will continue to work together with other businesses and policymakers to build a low-carbon economy, because we know that together, we can build a better future.” 

“Unilever remains committed to addressing climate change and implementing business practices that support a low carbon economy,” said Kees Kruythoff, president of Unilever North America. “We continue to support and drive the Paris Agreement and Unilever’s global goal to be carbon positive by 2030.”

“California has ambitious, clearly defined climate goals and is committed to acting as a global leader on this important issue,” said Melissa Lavinson, vice president of federal affairs and policy and chief sustainability officer at PG&E Corporation. “We support the state’s vision for a clean energy future and agree that we need to take action today to meet the challenge.”

“As a nation, the United States should set an example. We need low carbon policies, and we need to invest in a low carbon economy here and around the world,” said Erin Meezan, chief sustainability officer of Interface. “This means electing leaders who prioritize and support climate action, but it also means driving more momentum for these initiatives in the private sector. It's an incredibly unique time in history and the Paris Agreement has been a call to action.”

“At Sealed Air, we are proud to reaffirm our commitment to this objective and to underline the important role that businesses have in combating climate change,” said Sealed Air CEO Jerome Peribere. “In addition, we are again dedicating our support of energy efficient operations and a focus on lower carbon emissions as a signatory of the Business Backs a Low Carbon USA statement. We’re proving our commitment daily as seen in our aggressive sustainability goals, our operations, and in our innovative solutions that prevent waste across supply chains.”

“Avery Dennison is an enterprise founded on the basis of being a force for good,” said Roland Simon, vice president of global procurement materials group and corporate sustainability at Avery Dennison. “Our steadfast commitment to doing what's right to continually reduce industry impacts on the environment is why we support Low Carbon USA.” 

“HP reaffirms its support for the Paris Climate Agreement and the global efforts to address climate change,” said Nate Hurst, Chief Sustainability & Social Impact Officer at HP Inc. “We believe that working with like-minded businesses and governments, we can all reinvent how we do business and transition to a new low-carbon economy.”

“Paris has given climate change a legitimate place in all decision-making especially investment decision-making,” said Geeta Aiyer, president & founder of Boston Common Asset Management. “It's no longer the questionable ‘other’ pursuit; it’s part of a national and international pursuit. All countries are responsible for their own decarbonization plans and active parties to this agreement. Because of this, one set of uncertainties is removed, enabling investment planning and action for the long-term by investors, corporations, public entities, communities, and individuals.”

“As a leader of regenerative agriculture and sustainable practices in the wine industry for nearly fifty years, Fetzer Vineyards is well aware of the climate benefits and long-term business benefits associated with a commitment to clean energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction,” said Josh Prigge, director of regenerative development at Fetzer Vineyards. “The Low Carbon USA pledge represents an exciting and essential up swell of private sector voices supporting essential practices that will allow our nation and the world to thrive into the 21st Century and beyond. We are proud and humbled to be a part of this growing movement, and are committed to staying the course on our emission reduction activities.”

“Hannon Armstrong is committed to investing in the future of energy through its efficiency, wind and solar projects, thereby contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy,” said Jeff Eckel, president & CEO of Hannon Armstrong. “Not only do these investments in sustainable infrastructure help to mitigate climate change, they create jobs. The transition to clean energy is one of the great job producing opportunities of our time.”

“There are nearly 30 million business in the United States. If each one were to prioritize lessening their environmental impact, we could make significant progress in our path toward a low-carbon future,” said Jackie Herskovitz Russell, president of Teak Media + Communication. “Businesses have two choices when it comes to the environment: either be part of the problem or the solution. Teak wants to be part of the solution.”

“It is essential that businesses, governments and individuals direct their endeavors toward combatting climate change,” said Robert Schmidt, president of Joule Energy. “These efforts must begin with upholding the Paris Climate Agreement. At Joule Energy, we believe a vibrant, low-carbon economy is possible. We're doing our part, one energy solution at a time.”

“We are proud supporters of a Low-Carbon USA because as the largest, most broadly based healthcare company in the world, we understand that healthy people need a healthy planet,” said Paulette Frank, VP Environment, Health, Safety & Sustainability, at Johnson & Johnson. “ We have and will continue to do our part to reduce our carbon emissions and increase our use of renewable energy until we reach our ultimate aspiration of 100% renewable electricity.” 
“Creating jobs, and establishing the United States as an innovative world leader in creating a clean energy economy is a no brainer for the Trump administration,” said Aspen Skiing Company CEO Mike Kaplan. “If we stick to the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan, we’re well on our way to growing the manufacturing sector and protecting jobs in the $650 billion outdoor industry.”
"California's ongoing success in growing its economy while pioneering environmentally-responsible policies clearly demonstrates that low-carbon industry and sustained economic growth go hand-in-hand,” said Krystof Litomisky, CEO of Ecogate, Inc. “At Ecogate, we are excited about being a part of this future as the US continues to lead the world in innovation and economic strength.”

“As industry leaders we are in a position to create change by speaking up about what matters to us, from clean energy to plastic pollution,” said Shelly Gottschamer, chief sustainability officer at Outerknown. “By coming together, the business community is the catalyst that will keep us under the 2 degree Celsius tipping point determined by the Paris Accord. We are all together, and we have to act now to create this change regardless of today’s politics.”

“I am the CEO of an engineering company that designs healthcare facilities around the world,” said Walt Vernon, CEO of Mazzetti. “Here in the US, we are now facing design challenges like warmer temperatures than historic, requiring more air conditioning and more energy. We are facing issues of flood in coastal areas that did not experience them before. We are starting to think about the effects of weather disasters in ways we never did. And, in our international work, we are seeing even more clearly the impacts of climate change on lives of people.”

“It's a simple truth that green policies are good for our economy,” said Zach Tucker, founder of Goodmeetsworld. Swift action is needed in the coming years to not only protect our environment, but to protect the future of our economy as well.”

“Clean technology is a major engine of job growth in the United States, and is key to overcoming the challenge of climate change, said Dave Hudson, CEO of Vigilent. “Vigilent strongly supports continued U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement as the best means to address the climate challenge with global cooperation.”


“The Paris Agreement was a vital step forward, but its power is in our collective action,” said Lara Birkes, chief sustainability officer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “Business and government leaders must urgently work together to drive a thriving, low-carbon economy.”  

“It is vital that the business community demonstrates its ongoing commitment to tackling climate change,” said Barry Parkin, Chief Sustainability and Health and Wellbeing Officer at Mars Incorporated. “This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society. It is imperative that global businesses, like Mars, do their part to face down those threats.”


“Elections change our leadership but they don’t change reality,” said Matthew Hamilton, Sustainability Director at Aspen Skiing Company. “Thirty more frost free days are thirty fewer days we can make snow increasing the pressure on our business. The Paris agreement is critical to our business and the 6.1 million employees of the outdoor recreation industry.”


“Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is committed to creating a low-carbon economy and creating healthy environments for our associates, members and communities,” said Kyle Cahill, Director of Sustainability and Environmental Health at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. “We strongly support continued U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement to help address climate change, one of our biggest public health threats today.” 


“Delivering on the Paris Agreement is an opportunity and responsibility for all,” said Feike Sijbesma, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board, Royal DSM. “Now is the time to future proof our economies by investing in, among other, low-carbon infrastructure. Together we can create new jobs and build our infrastructure while securing clean air and sustainable energy. This is key for people today and generations to come.” 


“Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, LLC reaffirms our support of the Paris Climate Agreement to ensure we are doing our part to get to a low carbon future,” said Maria Arabatzis, Portfolio Manager and Shareholder Engagement Manager at Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, LLC.


“Kentucky needs to grow its clean economy more than many other states,” said Zaurie Zimmerman, CEO of The Lion Company in Louisville, Kentucky. “As CEO of the Lion Company, Inc., a 60 year old family business, I am hopeful that President-elect Trump is pragmatic enough to see the job-growing potential of the clean energy transition.  Affirming the US commitment to the Paris Agreement is a crucial strategy in keeping the US, and eventually Kentucky, truly competitive in the global economy.”  


“Sugarbush is fully committed to doing our part to reduce our carbon foot print and address climate change,” said Win Smith, President of Sugarbush Resort. “In recent years, we have converted our entire snowmaking system to using energy efficient guns, installed LED and florescent lighting on the majority of our resort, implemented composting in all of our kitchens and in some cafeterias, partnered in the development of six solar farms with a combined estimated annual generation rate of 5,340 megawatts of electricity, introduced reusable plates and cutlery in key dining facilities, and encouraged the use of reusable tumblers for our employees’ hydration. We have also made significant progress on a long-term plan to improve our local streams and brooks in partnership with local organizations. Climate change is real, and we are doing our part to combat it.”


“Long-term stable financial returns are dependent upon a stable and resilient climate,” said Adam Kanzer, Managing Director, Domini Social Investments LLC. “The goal established by the Paris agreement to limit average temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, with a target of 1.5 degrees, is not simply a good idea, it is an imperative. Today, we recommit ourselves to that goal and urge our government to do the same.”

DexMat - High Performance Carbon Nanotubes products






















































 
 








DexMat manufactures high performance products made from Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) for a new generation of consumer and commercial applications.

DexMat’s competitive advantage is our proprietary solution-processing technology of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), originally developed at Rice University by our founders. Our technology delivers fibers and films that are made of essentially pure CNTs, without the use of binders and additives. Our process is scalable to large volume manufacturing and cost effective.
DexMat’s CNT fibers and films conduct electricity like metals; yet have the flexibility, lightweight and corrosion resistance qualities of polymers—the best of both worlds.


PreviousNext12

Brief History of DexMat
The fundamental technology used by DexMat was developed over the last ten years by a multitude of researchers in Prof. Pasquali’s lab at Rice University. Professor Pasquali’s vision to build a 100% CNT-based macro-object from an infinite number of nano-sized CNT molecules using a process that could be scaled to large volume manufacturing, culminated with the highly cited research paper published in Science, 11 Jan 2013 pp. 182-186.
Late in 2014, DexMat’s founders met in Houston to discuss forming a private company to capitalize on the technology. The deal was sealed over a few glasses of Barolo and Amarone.
The company was incorporated in early February 2015.

DexMatDmitri TsentalovichFounderEducation: Ph.D. Chemical Engineering, Rice University, 2015; B.S. Chemical Engineering, University of New Hampshire, 2008.
Dr. Tsentalovich is an expert in the fields of carbon nanotubes and fluid-phase-processing, specializing in the production and commercialization of multifunctional carbon nanotube based materials. His research in the Pasquali group was focused on studying the fluid properties of CNT solutions in chlorosulfonic acid in order to improve the strength and conductivity of acid-spun CNT fibers.  His graduate work includes publications that describe a method for measuring the length of CNTs with extensional rheology, phase behavior of CNT and graphene solutions, and spinning and post-processing CNT fibers. 
Dr. Tsentalovich has presented his research on carbon nanotube rheology in conferences such as the Society of Rheology 2010 and the International Congress on Rheology 2012. He presented his research on carbon nanotube fibers at the American Society of Mechanical Engineering Congress 2013. Dr. Tsentalovich helped DexMat win $67,000 in the 2015 Rice Business Plan Competition and has more than one year of business management experience as a cofounder of Nanolinea, a startup based on the commercial development of carbon nanotube fibers for treating cardiac arrhythmias.
DexMatFrancesca MirriCo-OwnerFrancesca Mirri is a co-owner of DexMat and a 5th year PhD candidate in the research group of Prof. Matteo Pasquali in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at Rice University. She graduated with a BS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Bologna (2009).  
Her research has focused on the production and characterization of conductive films and coatings from solutions of carbon nanotubes in chlorosulfonic acid. In particular, Francesca has developed a process to coat CNT acid solutions over the insulation layer of coaxial cables, as a means to create an effective and extra-lightweight EM shield for coaxial cables—potentially eliminating the use of heavy metal braids in coaxial cables. In addition, Francesca has extensive experience coating thin films of CNT solutions to produce electrically conductive transparent films.
Francesca’s scientific experience includes work on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes using a CVD process on a substrate pre-seeded with catalyst.
Her work has been published in scientific journals and presented in conferences such as the International Society of Coating Science & Technology (ISCST) symposium in 2014 and Chemontubes in 2012.
