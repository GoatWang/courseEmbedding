Item Description: LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, Germany, 2010. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.The present study was undertaken with the objective to explore the anticataract potential of methanolic extract of Butea frondosa leaves by oxidative stress (Hydrogen peroxide) in Goat eyes (lens) and also the anti-inflammatory activity of aqueous extract of Butea frondosa bark in rats. Butea frondosa is commonly known as Palash and the plant belongs to family Leguminosae. In view of the literature findings, sufficient studies were reported on flowers and seeds, and lesser attention was paid towards leaves. Therefore, the present study was planned to concentrate upon leaves and was selected for the study, which is a rich source of phytoconstituents. In Chromatographic studies the TLC plates were observed using different solvent systems, detected under short wave UV spectrophotometer, with a Rf value of 0.26, 0.30, 0.42, 0.55. After conducting phytochemical test, focus was on to isolate the desired compound using repeated column chromatography. Chloroform and Methanol (9:1) were used as eluent for separation of desired compound from the crude extract.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9783843380812

Rajiv Gupta is a Silicon Valley technology executive who was born and educated in India
Early life[edit]
Gupta earned a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur around 1984. He received his Ph.D. in compiler optimization from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1990.[1] He married a British woman, Debra and they have two children - Veda and Anya. He resides in Los Altos.[1][2]
Career[edit]
Gupta joined Hewlett-Packard in 1990, and developed the IA-64 architecture, which HP called WideWord and Intel marketed as Itanium. From 1995 he developed a client utility project at HP Labs, which was an early example of a service-oriented architecture for Web services.[3][4][5] He was co-inventor and general manager of the E-speak project when it was announced in 1999.[1] Around the same time, he supported his brother Sanjiv Gupta, to start Bodhtree Consulting, Ltd., in Hyderabad, India.[6] The E-speak technology was abandoned in late 2001.[7][8] In 2002, Gupta founded Confluent Software, developing what became the CoreSV product. It was acquired by Oblix in February 2004,[9] which in turn was acquired by Oracle Corporation in March, 2005.[10] In 2005 he founded Securent, which was acquired by Cisco in November 2007 for an estimated $100 million.[10][11] He has more than 45 patents.[1]
In 2011 Gupta founded Skyhigh Networks. The first round of financing was led by Greylock Partners in April, 2012, for about $6.5 million.[12] The company raised $20 million in May, 2013, led by Sequoia Capital.[13] Another investment of $40 million was announced in June, 2014, from existing investors and Salesforce.com.[14]
