Description


Aiding researchers seeking to eliminate multi-step procedures, reduce delays in treatment and ease patient care, Cancer Theranostics reviews, assesses, and makes pertinent clinical recommendations on the integration of comprehensive in vitro diagnostics, in vivo molecular imaging, and individualized treatments towards the personalization of cancer treatment. 
Cancer Theranostics describes the identification of novel biomarkers to advance molecular diagnostics of cancer. The book encompasses new molecular imaging probes and techniques for early detection of cancer, and describes molecular imaging-guided cancer therapy. Discussion also includes nanoplatforms incorporating both cancer imaging and therapeutic components, as well as clinical translation and future perspectives.




Key Features



Supports elimination of multi-step approaches and reduces delays in treatments through combinatorial diagnosis and therapy
Fully assesses cancer theranostics across the emergent field, with discussion of biomarkers, molecular imaging, imaging guided therapy, nanotechnology, and personalized medicine 
Content bridges laboratory, clinic, and biotechnology industries to advance biomedical science and improve patient management




Readership


Industry and academia working on drug discovery/development, pharmacology, personalized medicine, nanomedicine, medical imaging, imaging guided therapy, biomarkers, molecular pathology, proteomics, genomics, microarray chips, molecular biology.
