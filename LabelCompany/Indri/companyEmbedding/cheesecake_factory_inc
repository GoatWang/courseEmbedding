Thank you for visiting The Cheesecake Factory website.
We value your comments and suggestions. The information you provide will be used only to help us better serve you and will not be sold or shared for any other purpose.
If you are writing with a question, we suggest that you first visit the Got Questions? section of the website. You may be able to find the answer to your question immediately by reviewing our list of frequently asked questions. If not, please complete the following form and we will get back with you as quickly as possible.
*Indicates Required Field 




								Reservations and Large Party Questions


Do you accept reservations?Sorry! We unfortunately do not take reservations for dining during peak times such as evenings, weekends or holidays. When it is not a busy holiday or special event season, many restaurants gladly accept a few large party reservations for off-peak dining. Large parties can reserve for an early lunch immediately after we open (11 or 11:30AM) or for dining during quieter times such as weekday afternoons (3 - 6PM) or after 9PM. Guests joining us for dinner or on the weekends, are seated in order of arrival based on party size. You're always welcome to call your local restaurant and speak to a manager. He or she will be happy to guide you to the best times to dine at your local restaurant!
When is a good time to visit if I don’t have a lot of time to wait?Arrive early or dine late! Most restaurants are busiest at peak meal times; from noon - 2PM and 6 - 8PM on weekdays.  Weekends can be busy all day until about 9PM.  If you come on a weekday before 6:00PM, you can usually get right in without any wait at all! Our entire menu is always available at our self-seating “high top” tables located in our bar areas.  Also, almost everything on our menu can be ordered for takeout by phone or at our bakery counters.  Most locations offer our wonderful catering menu and many also offer Curbside To-Go service.

Can you accommodate large parties?  
While each location is unique, most of our restaurants have open floor plans which can accommodate a few large parties. Many locations accept reservations for large parties (seven or more) for dining at quieter times such as for early lunch immediately after we open (11 or 11:30AM) or for weekday afternoons (3 - 6PM). We do not take reservations, even for large parties, for dining during busy times such as evenings, weekends, holidays or special event seasons such as prom or graduation. However, there are still many other off-peak times when we would be happy to reserve for your large party, so please call your local restaurant and speak to a manager. He or she will be happy to answer any questions for you!


Can I book a Private Function?
A few locations offer private dining rooms or banquet facilities to accommodate 25 to 200 guests. See our Banquet Information page.

 





								Whole Cheesecake Questions


Can I buy a whole cheesecake at one of your restaurants?Absolutely! All our cheesecakes and specialty cakes are available for purchase at our Bakery Counter. All cheesecakes and specialty cakes come in 10-inch sizes, serving 12 – 15 people, and most are sold pre-sliced into 12 slices. Our most popular cheesecakes are also available in 7-inch sizes, serving 6 – 8 people.  Select cheesecakes come in our 6-inch size, serving 4 – 6 people. Prices start at $45.95 for 10-inch cakes; $26.95 for 7-inch cakes; and $18.95 for 6-inch cakes. If purchased deeply chilled, they travel well and can be stored in your freezer to enjoy later. Defrost in your refrigerator overnight to enjoy at home.We welcome preorders if you would like to reserve a specific cake or size for your home, office, special occasion or holiday celebration. For those who cannot decide on just one cheesecake flavor, we have the perfect solution: Order two different half 10" cakes! Half Cheesecakes and Layer Cakes are priced at $25.00 to $30.00.
Do you ship cakes or can I purchase one online?We do not ship our cakes but you can purchase some of our most popular cheesecakes online here through Harry and David. Or, find some of our delicious cheesecakes - made slightly smaller - at select warehouse and grocery stores nationwide.

If your school or organization is interested in our program, please submit a donation request to your local Cheesecake Factory no later than 30 days prior to your event. Your request must be written on your organization's letterhead and include the following:

* The specific purpose for the donation and how it will be used.

Starbucks to open its first cafe  in Uruguay in 2018
Starbucks Corp.  said Tuesday that it will open its first restaurant in Uruguay in 2018. The company has reached a licensing agreement with longtime partner Alsea, a restaurant operator for Latin America and Spain, to develop and operate the new stores. The two companies have worked together since 2002 with 841 Starbucks restaurants in Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia. The first Uruguay cafe will be in Montevideo. Other Alsea restaurants include Domino's Pizza Inc. , Cheesecake Factory Inc.  and Restaurant Brands International Inc.'s  Burger King. Starbucks shares are up 0.5% in premarket trading, and up 11.1% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 22% for the last 12 months.

Cheesecake Factory's stock suffering biggest plunge in over 8 years into bear-market territory
Cheesecake Factory Inc.'s stock  was suffering its worst day in over eight years, as the stock plunged in active trade in the wake of the restaurant chain's sales warning. The 9.2% tumble in morning trade, to a 7-month low, put the stock on track to suffer its biggest one-day percentage decline since it lost 12.4% on Feb. 13, 2009. Volume spiked to 3.2 million shares, already nearly triple the full-day average. The stock was currently trading at $52.96, or 21.1% below its May 3 record close of $67.09. A close at or below $53.67 would kick off a new bear market, which many on Wall Street define as a decline of at least 20% from a significant peak. Earlier, the company cut its second-quarter same-store sales outlook to a decline of about 1% from and expected rise of 1% to 2%. The stock has shed 11.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Cheesecake Factory shares sink after downward revision of guidance
Cheesecake Factory Inc.  shares were down 6.1% in Tuesday premarket trading after the restaurant chain issued a downward revision of its second-quarter guidance. Cheesecake Factory now expects second-quarter same-restaurant sales to decline about 1%, compared with previous guidance for an increase of 1% to 2%. The FactSet consensus is for a 1.7% increase. Cheesecake Factory expects the same-store sales decline to hurt second-quarter margins and earnings per share. The company has seen "more volatility in the week-to-week sales trends, indicative of uncertainty on the part of many consumers," said Chief Executive David Overton in a statement. "Specifically, we have seen pockets of softness as we moved through the quarter, notably in the East and Midwest where we also faced unfavorable weather that reduced patio usage." Cheesecake Factory shares are down 5.7% for the last three months while the S&P 500 index  is up 2.4% for the period.

Buffalo Wild Wings responds to activist investor, Mercato Capital Management
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  issued a statement Thursday in response to what it calls "misleading claims" made by activist investors, Mercato Capital Management. The restaurant chain says Mercato based its "flawed analysis" of the company's performance on comparisons with restaurants and retailers that are "meaningfully different," much larger companies, and broad market indices like the Nasdaq. "Buffalo Wild Wings should instead be compared to its casual dining peers," the company wrote. "The casual dining peer group utilized by Buffalo Wild Wings properly excludes companies that are quick-serve, fast-food or delivery restaurants as well as companies outside the restaurant industry." Among the companies it calls peers are Cheesecake Factory Inc. , Outback Steakhouse parent Bloomin' Brands Inc. , Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. , and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. . "Compared with the median returns generated by this set of our casual dining peers, Buffalo Wild Wings has generated significantly better returns for its shareholders," the statement said, adding that the company has had compounded annual returns of more than 24% annually since its IPO. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are unchanged in premarket trading and up 20.1% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 16.4% for the last 12 months.

Starbucks to open its first cafe  in Uruguay in 2018
Starbucks Corp.  said Tuesday that it will open its first restaurant in Uruguay in 2018. The company has reached a licensing agreement with longtime partner Alsea, a restaurant operator for Latin America and Spain, to develop and operate the new stores. The two companies have worked together since 2002 with 841 Starbucks restaurants in Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia. The first Uruguay cafe will be in Montevideo. Other Alsea restaurants include Domino's Pizza Inc. , Cheesecake Factory Inc.  and Restaurant Brands International Inc.'s  Burger King. Starbucks shares are up 0.5% in premarket trading, and up 11.1% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 22% for the last 12 months.

Cheesecake Factory's stock suffering biggest plunge in over 8 years into bear-market territory
Cheesecake Factory Inc.'s stock  was suffering its worst day in over eight years, as the stock plunged in active trade in the wake of the restaurant chain's sales warning. The 9.2% tumble in morning trade, to a 7-month low, put the stock on track to suffer its biggest one-day percentage decline since it lost 12.4% on Feb. 13, 2009. Volume spiked to 3.2 million shares, already nearly triple the full-day average. The stock was currently trading at $52.96, or 21.1% below its May 3 record close of $67.09. A close at or below $53.67 would kick off a new bear market, which many on Wall Street define as a decline of at least 20% from a significant peak. Earlier, the company cut its second-quarter same-store sales outlook to a decline of about 1% from and expected rise of 1% to 2%. The stock has shed 11.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Cheesecake Factory shares sink after downward revision of guidance
Cheesecake Factory Inc.  shares were down 6.1% in Tuesday premarket trading after the restaurant chain issued a downward revision of its second-quarter guidance. Cheesecake Factory now expects second-quarter same-restaurant sales to decline about 1%, compared with previous guidance for an increase of 1% to 2%. The FactSet consensus is for a 1.7% increase. Cheesecake Factory expects the same-store sales decline to hurt second-quarter margins and earnings per share. The company has seen "more volatility in the week-to-week sales trends, indicative of uncertainty on the part of many consumers," said Chief Executive David Overton in a statement. "Specifically, we have seen pockets of softness as we moved through the quarter, notably in the East and Midwest where we also faced unfavorable weather that reduced patio usage." Cheesecake Factory shares are down 5.7% for the last three months while the S&P 500 index  is up 2.4% for the period.

Buffalo Wild Wings responds to activist investor, Mercato Capital Management
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  issued a statement Thursday in response to what it calls "misleading claims" made by activist investors, Mercato Capital Management. The restaurant chain says Mercato based its "flawed analysis" of the company's performance on comparisons with restaurants and retailers that are "meaningfully different," much larger companies, and broad market indices like the Nasdaq. "Buffalo Wild Wings should instead be compared to its casual dining peers," the company wrote. "The casual dining peer group utilized by Buffalo Wild Wings properly excludes companies that are quick-serve, fast-food or delivery restaurants as well as companies outside the restaurant industry." Among the companies it calls peers are Cheesecake Factory Inc. , Outback Steakhouse parent Bloomin' Brands Inc. , Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. , and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. . "Compared with the median returns generated by this set of our casual dining peers, Buffalo Wild Wings has generated significantly better returns for its shareholders," the statement said, adding that the company has had compounded annual returns of more than 24% annually since its IPO. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are unchanged in premarket trading and up 20.1% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 16.4% for the last 12 months.

Product #: newitem158954388Normal Price: $99.95Our Sales Price: $79.95 (You Save: 20%)Qty:   Tweet      PRODUCT DESCRIPTION     Beautifully engraved certificate from Cheesecake Factory, Inc. . This historic document was printed by the American Banknote Company and has an 
ornate border around it with a vignette of the company's name. This item has the printed signatures of the Company�s Chairman, David M. Overton and and CFO, Michael J. Dixon.


Certificate VignetteThe Cheesecake Factory, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAKE) is a restaurant company in the United States. The company currently operates 146 dining restaurants under The Cheesecake Factory name in 34 states and the District of Colombia. The company also operates 13 restaurants under the Grand Lux Cafe name and one under the RockSugar Pan Asian Kitchen name.The restaurants are characterized by extensive menus, custom d�cor, and large portions. David M. Overton, the company's founder, opened the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, in 1978. The restaurant established the future chain's pattern of offering an eclectic menu, big portions, and signature cheesecakes.The company used to operate one self-service, limited-menu express foodservice operation under The Cheesecake Factory Express marque inside the DisneyQuest family entertainment center in Orlando, Florida. Its cheesecakes and other baked goods can also be found in the cafes of many Barnes and Noble book stores.In addition, it operates a bakery production facility in Calabasas, California, which produces baked desserts and other products for its restaurants and other foodservice operators, retailers, and distributors. A second bakery was opened in Rocky Mount, North Carolina in March 2006. The Rocky Mount plant handles the distribution for the eastern half of the United States.According to the company's website, the Cheesecake Factory had its beginnings with Oscar and Evelyn Overton, who dreamed of opening their own business, and more specifically with Evelyn, a skilled cook with a cheesecake recipe much liked by her friends.Evelyn first decided to open a business after making a cheesecake for her husband's employer in 1949. Evelyn opened a small cheesecake shop in Detroit, Michigan in the late 1940s, but later gave it up in order to raise her two children, David and Renee. She continued to supply cakes to several of the best local restaurants, however, through a kitchen in her basement.By 1971, their children were now grown, and Oscar and Evelyn moved the business to Los Angeles, using the last of their savings to open a 700-square-foot (65 m2) store that bore the name "The Cheesecake Factory."Evelyn would bake and manage the office while Oscar worked and sales and building new accounts. The early years of their new company were sometimes difficult, but as the company's reputation and sales grew, company adjusted accordingly.The Overtons realized they needed a larger bakery, which they opened in 1975, at which point their business expanded dramatically, with Evelyn creating over 20 varieties of cheesecake and other desserts for hundreds of accounts from Santa Barbara to San Diego, and even out of state.In 1978, David founded The Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, which made Evelyn's cheesecakes even more famous. The chain would become a multi-million-dollar sales performer. The company went public in 1992, and was the first restaurant chain to reach a billion dollars in revenues with fewer than 100 restaurants in operation.History from Wikipedia and OldCompany.com (old stock certificate research service).
