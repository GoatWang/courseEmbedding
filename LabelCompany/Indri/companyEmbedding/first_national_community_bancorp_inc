At FNCB, we believe there's a better way to bank than 
						what most people are used to. Of course, it involves having 
						access to all the latest personal banking products, including 
						online banking, bill pay and mobile banking. But there's 
						more to banking than this.
For more than 100 years, we have provided not only comprehensive 
						and cutting-edge personal banking products, but also a high 
						level of personalized service and dedication to communities 
						throughout northeast Pennsylvania.
This is why we’re simply a better bank. Come in and let 
						us show you how.
