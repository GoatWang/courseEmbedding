History[edit]
See also: Elron Electronic Industries
The origins of Elbit Medical Imaging can be traced to 1990, when Elbit's medical arm, at the time a subsidiary of Elron, acquired a majority share in Elscint. Elscint was a company founded in 1969, which developed medical imaging equipment such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1996, Elbit was spun off into three independent companies, and Elbit Medical Imaging was created as separate NASDAQ listed company (ticker symbol:EMITF).[2]
During 1999 and 2000Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to GE Healthcare and to Picker (now Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.[2]
In 1999 Elron Electronic Industries sold all its holdings in Elbit Medical Imaging to Europe Israel Ltd., formerly an Israeli company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and controlled by real estate developer Mordechai (Moti) Zisser, for a sum of approximately $127.8 million.[1]
Following the acquisition in May 1999, Zisser integrated his existing real estate activities into the company and restructured Elbit Medical Imaging as a holding company, focusing on: real estate and hotels development, shopping and entertainment malls, industrial manufacturing and supply of components for the medical imaging; and venture capital investments in high-technology and bio-technology companies.[3]
In 2005 Elscint, which was the first Israeli company to be listed on NASDAQ in 1972, was delisted and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Medical Imaging. At that time, Elscint was no longer engaged in its original medical imaging equipment activities.
On November 1, 2006, Plaza Centers N.V., an indirect subsidiary of Elbit Imaging, was listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company raised approximately £166 million of gross proceeds and its shares are traded under the ticker "PLAZ". On October 19, 2007 Plaza Centers N.V.s shares were also listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange under the ticker "PLZ".[4]
In August 2007, Elbit Imaging sold its Arena Plaza Mall in Budapest, Hungary to Active Asset Investment Management (aAIM), a company chaired by Sir Alex Ferguson, for €400m. The mall was still under construction and was opened in November 2007 by Sir Alex.[5]
In November 2007 the company's name was changed from Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd. to Elbit Imaging Ltd.
In March 2014 Elbit Imaging Ltd, Announces talks of purchasing "Gamida Cell"

History[edit]
Early years – A division within Elron[edit]
Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (TASE: ELRN), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers). Elbit steadily expanded developing and producing logistic-support weapon delivery and navigation systems for most Israeli aircraft, establishing a combat avionics package for the IAI Lavi fighter aircraft, and producing a fire-control system for the Merkava tank.[1]
1996 IPO on NASDAQ[edit]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF – During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit, the company had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market with the symbol NASDAQ:ESLT and finished its first day of trading at a price of $7.75. Elbit Systems has a market cap of over $3 Billion.
Elbit – which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002, Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003–2006 for approximately $160 million.

Merger with El-Op[edit]
In 2000, Elbit Systems merged with El-Op (a company controlled by the current Chairman, Michael Federmann), creating the largest non governmental defense electronics company in Israel and increasing Elbit Systems' value which later in 2004 enabled Elron to sell its shares in Elbit Systems for approximately $200 million. Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann became the largest shareholder in the combined group.
Growth by acquisition[edit]
Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann and CEO Joseph Ackerman led an aggressive growth by acquisitions strategy.
The company acquired companies, including:

Elisra
Tadiran Communications
Shiron Satellite Communications
BVR Systems
Assets of Israel Military Industries’ Aircraft Systems Division
Innovative Concepts, Inc.
Mikal Ltd (the company initially purchased 19% of the firm, and later agreed to acquire Mikal's 100% holdings in Soltam Systems and Saymar and the 87.85% portion of ITL held by Mikal, in exchange Mikal's owners received the 19% of Mikal that Elbit had purchased)[2] Elbit subsequently announced a cash tender offer for the 12.15% remainder of ITL held by the public.[3]

Recent news[edit]

EFW in Fort Worth, Texas (the EFW facility also houses ESA's home office)

EFW manufactures various components for the F-16, V-22, and Bradley Fighting Vehicle, among other programs. It was initially the electronics manufacturing facility for General Dynamics operations in Fort Worth; when GD sold its aviation business to Lockheed Martin the latter was not interested in the facility which was then sold to Elbit.[12]


IEI in Talladega, Alabama (formerly International Enterprises, Inc.)
Kollsman Inc. in Merrimack, New Hampshire (founded in 1928 by Paul Kollsman, who invented barometers and instrument flight in airplanes)

Kollsman is a subcontractor to Boeing on SBInet, a high-tech security system for the U.S.-Mexico border in conjunction with the United States Department of Homeland Security.[13]


Talla-Com in Tallahassee, Florida
Innovative Concepts, Inc. (ICI) in McLean, Virginia, purchased in November 2008 from Herley Industries[14]
VSI in San Jose, California (a joint venture with Rockwell Collins, formerly known as Vision Systems International; Elbit and Rockwell Collins each own 50%)
UAS Dynamics in Fort Mill, South Carolina (originally a 50–50 joint venture with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products; on December 1, 2011 Elbit purchased GD's 50% share)[15]
M7 Aerospace in San Antonio, Texas[16]

South America[edit]
 Brazil – In 2001, Aeroeletronica (AEL), a Brazilian company that had more than two decades of experience in the defense industry has become a part of the Elbit Systems Group.[17] In January 2011, Elbit announced that it had bought two more Brazilian companies: Ares Aeroespecial e Defesa, and Periscopio Equipamentos Optronicos.[18] In April 2011, Embraer has entered into a strategic agreement with AEL Sistemas S.A (“AEL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. The two companies were yet to define the specific programs to be pursued but, according to officials from the two companies, the main goals of the cooperation were the expanding of joint activities in the area of unmanned aircraft systems, including the anticipated creation of a jointly owned company, with majority participation of Embraer D&S. One of the primary goals of the joint venture will be to promote the introduction and use of Elbit Systems Hermes 450 UAV in the service of the Brazilian Air Force.[19]
 Colombia – In March 2010, a $28 million contract for Hermes 450 UAVs was suspended by the Colombian government after media reports based on anonymous letters alleged that Colombian officials had been bribed.[20][21] The Israeli Ministry of Defense investigated and found that the letters likely came from Israel Aerospace Industries, a competitor that lost the tender.[20] The incident led to a review of the regulations governing overseas competition between Israeli defense companies.[20]
Divestment[edit]
On September 3, 2009, the Norwegian Pension Fund's ethical council decided to sell the fund's stocks in Elbit due to the corporations supply of surveillance systems for the Israeli West Bank barrier.[22] At a press conference to announce the decision, Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen said "We do not wish to fund companies that so directly contribute to violations of international humanitarian law". The Norwegian Ambassador to Israel was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry where the decision was protested.[23]
In January 2010, Danske Bank added Elbit to the list of companies that fail its Socially Responsible Investment policy; a bank spokesman noted that it was acting in the interests of its customers by not 'placing their money in companies that violate international standards'.[24][25] The Danish financial watchdog Danwatch has also placed Elbit on its ethical blacklist,[26] and one of Denmark's largest pension fund administrators PKA Ltd announced it will no longer consider investing in Elbit, stating "The ICJ stated that the barrier only serves military purposes and violates Palestinian human rights. Therefore we have looked at whether companies produce custom-designed products to the wall and thus has a particular involvement in repressive activities."[25]
In March 2010, a Swedish pension fund not wanting to be associated with companies which in its opinion are violating international treaties, boycotted Elbit Systems for being involved in constructing the Israeli West Bank security fence.[27]

History[edit]
Early years – A division within Elron[edit]
Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (TASE: ELRN), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers). Elbit steadily expanded developing and producing logistic-support weapon delivery and navigation systems for most Israeli aircraft, establishing a combat avionics package for the IAI Lavi fighter aircraft, and producing a fire-control system for the Merkava tank.[1]
1996 IPO on NASDAQ[edit]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF – During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit, the company had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market with the symbol NASDAQ:ESLT and finished its first day of trading at a price of $7.75. Elbit Systems has a market cap of over $3 Billion.
Elbit – which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002, Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003–2006 for approximately $160 million.

Merger with El-Op[edit]
In 2000, Elbit Systems merged with El-Op (a company controlled by the current Chairman, Michael Federmann), creating the largest non governmental defense electronics company in Israel and increasing Elbit Systems' value which later in 2004 enabled Elron to sell its shares in Elbit Systems for approximately $200 million. Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann became the largest shareholder in the combined group.
Growth by acquisition[edit]
Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann and CEO Joseph Ackerman led an aggressive growth by acquisitions strategy.
The company acquired companies, including:

Elisra
Tadiran Communications
Shiron Satellite Communications
BVR Systems
Assets of Israel Military Industries’ Aircraft Systems Division
Innovative Concepts, Inc.
Mikal Ltd (the company initially purchased 19% of the firm, and later agreed to acquire Mikal's 100% holdings in Soltam Systems and Saymar and the 87.85% portion of ITL held by Mikal, in exchange Mikal's owners received the 19% of Mikal that Elbit had purchased)[2] Elbit subsequently announced a cash tender offer for the 12.15% remainder of ITL held by the public.[3]

Recent news[edit]
In October 2014, Elbit Systems won a $12.7 million contract for the supply and provision of Apache Aviator Integrated Helmets for the US Army helicopter fleet. The contract would be delivered over a two-year period.[4]

History[edit]
Early years – A division within Elron[edit]
Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (TASE: ELRN), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers). Elbit steadily expanded developing and producing logistic-support weapon delivery and navigation systems for most Israeli aircraft, establishing a combat avionics package for the IAI Lavi fighter aircraft, and producing a fire-control system for the Merkava tank.[1]
1996 IPO on NASDAQ[edit]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF – During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit, the company had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market with the symbol NASDAQ:ESLT and finished its first day of trading at a price of $7.75. Elbit Systems has a market cap of over $3 Billion.
Elbit – which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002, Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003–2006 for approximately $160 million.

Merger with El-Op[edit]
In 2000, Elbit Systems merged with El-Op (a company controlled by the current Chairman, Michael Federmann), creating the largest non governmental defense electronics company in Israel and increasing Elbit Systems' value which later in 2004 enabled Elron to sell its shares in Elbit Systems for approximately $200 million. Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann became the largest shareholder in the combined group.
Growth by acquisition[edit]
Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann and CEO Joseph Ackerman led an aggressive growth by acquisitions strategy.
The company acquired companies, including:

Elisra
Tadiran Communications
Shiron Satellite Communications
BVR Systems
Assets of Israel Military Industries’ Aircraft Systems Division
Innovative Concepts, Inc.
Mikal Ltd (the company initially purchased 19% of the firm, and later agreed to acquire Mikal's 100% holdings in Soltam Systems and Saymar and the 87.85% portion of ITL held by Mikal, in exchange Mikal's owners received the 19% of Mikal that Elbit had purchased)[2] Elbit subsequently announced a cash tender offer for the 12.15% remainder of ITL held by the public.[3]

Recent news[edit]
In October 2014, Elbit Systems won a $12.7 million contract for the supply and provision of Apache Aviator Integrated Helmets for the US Army helicopter fleet. The contract would be delivered over a two-year period.[4]

Simulators was produced by Romanian Company Simultec ownership of Elbit Systems, On March 2, 2014 centar was opened with ceremony led by President of Republic Of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, Premier of Republic Of Macedonia Nikola Gruevski, ex-minister from Ministry of Defence and other guests.
 Romania – Elbit Systems' activities in Romania, which started in 1996, are primarily carried out through its wholly owned Romanian subsidiaries, Elbit Systeme S.A., A-E Electronics S.A, Elmet International SRL and Simultec SRL, which employ approximately 400 employees.[9] On May 24, 2011, Elbit announced that it was awarded a contract valued at approximately $18.6 million to upgrade the Romanian Air Forces' C-130 transport aircraft. According to the agreement, the C-130 aircraft will be installed with various types of advanced electronic systems, including those produced by Elbit Systems' wholly owned subsidiary – Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. The project, to be performed over four years, will be executed in cooperation with local companies in Romania, led by the Romanian Aeronautical Industry.[9]
 United Kingdom – In 2005 Elbit set up a joint venture company in the UK with Thales, UAV Tactical Systems Ltd (U-TacS), developing the British Army Watchkeeper WK450. On December 7, 2007 it was announced that QinetiQ will join the programme as a sub-contractor to provide testing services at ParcAberporth, West Wales.[10] In 2007, Elbit acquired Ferranti Technologies (Group) Limited.[11]
North America[edit]
 United States – Elbit owns several companies in the United States through its American subsidiary, Elbit Systems of America (ESA):

EFW in Fort Worth, Texas (the EFW facility also houses ESA's home office)

EFW manufactures various components for the F-16, V-22, and Bradley Fighting Vehicle, among other programs. It was initially the electronics manufacturing facility for General Dynamics operations in Fort Worth; when GD sold its aviation business to Lockheed Martin the latter was not interested in the facility which was then sold to Elbit.[12]


IEI in Talladega, Alabama (formerly International Enterprises, Inc.)
Kollsman Inc. in Merrimack, New Hampshire (founded in 1928 by Paul Kollsman, who invented barometers and instrument flight in airplanes)

Kollsman is a subcontractor to Boeing on SBInet, a high-tech security system for the U.S.-Mexico border in conjunction with the United States Department of Homeland Security.[13]


Talla-Com in Tallahassee, Florida
Innovative Concepts, Inc. (ICI) in McLean, Virginia, purchased in November 2008 from Herley Industries[14]
VSI in San Jose, California (a joint venture with Rockwell Collins, formerly known as Vision Systems International; Elbit and Rockwell Collins each own 50%)
UAS Dynamics in Fort Mill, South Carolina (originally a 50–50 joint venture with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products; on December 1, 2011 Elbit purchased GD's 50% share)[15]
M7 Aerospace in San Antonio, Texas[16]

South America[edit]
 Brazil – In 2001, Aeroeletronica (AEL), a Brazilian company that had more than two decades of experience in the defense industry has become a part of the Elbit Systems Group.[17] In January 2011, Elbit announced that it had bought two more Brazilian companies: Ares Aeroespecial e Defesa, and Periscopio Equipamentos Optronicos.[18] In April 2011, Embraer has entered into a strategic agreement with AEL Sistemas S.A (“AEL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. The two companies were yet to define the specific programs to be pursued but, according to officials from the two companies, the main goals of the cooperation were the expanding of joint activities in the area of unmanned aircraft systems, including the anticipated creation of a jointly owned company, with majority participation of Embraer D&S. One of the primary goals of the joint venture will be to promote the introduction and use of Elbit Systems Hermes 450 UAV in the service of the Brazilian Air Force.[19]
 Colombia – In March 2010, a $28 million contract for Hermes 450 UAVs was suspended by the Colombian government after media reports based on anonymous letters alleged that Colombian officials had been bribed.[20][21] The Israeli Ministry of Defense investigated and found that the letters likely came from Israel Aerospace Industries, a competitor that lost the tender.[20] The incident led to a review of the regulations governing overseas competition between Israeli defense companies.[20]
Divestment[edit]
On September 3, 2009, the Norwegian Pension Fund's ethical council decided to sell the fund's stocks in Elbit due to the corporations supply of surveillance systems for the Israeli West Bank barrier.[22] At a press conference to announce the decision, Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen said "We do not wish to fund companies that so directly contribute to violations of international humanitarian law". The Norwegian Ambassador to Israel was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry where the decision was protested.[23]
In January 2010, Danske Bank added Elbit to the list of companies that fail its Socially Responsible Investment policy; a bank spokesman noted that it was acting in the interests of its customers by not 'placing their money in companies that violate international standards'.[24][25] The Danish financial watchdog Danwatch has also placed Elbit on its ethical blacklist,[26] and one of Denmark's largest pension fund administrators PKA Ltd announced it will no longer consider investing in Elbit, stating "The ICJ stated that the barrier only serves military purposes and violates Palestinian human rights. Therefore we have looked at whether companies produce custom-designed products to the wall and thus has a particular involvement in repressive activities."[25]
In March 2010, a Swedish pension fund not wanting to be associated with companies which in its opinion are violating international treaties, boycotted Elbit Systems for being involved in constructing the Israeli West Bank security fence.[27]

Early years – A division within Elron[edit]
Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (TASE: ELRN), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers).

1996 IPO on NASDAQ[edit]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF – During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.

 Brazil – In 2001, Aeroeletronica (AEL), a Brazilian company that had more than two decades of experience in the defense industry has become a part of the Elbit Systems Group.[17] In January 2011, Elbit announced that it had bought two more Brazilian companies: Ares Aeroespecial e Defesa, and Periscopio Equipamentos Optronicos.[18] In April 2011, Embraer has entered into a strategic agreement with AEL Sistemas S.A (“AEL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. The two companies were yet to define the specific programs to be pursued but, according to officials from the two companies, the main goals of the cooperation were the expanding of joint activities in the area of unmanned aircraft systems, including the anticipated creation of a jointly owned company, with majority participation of Embraer D&S. One of the primary goals of the joint venture will be to promote the introduction and use of Elbit Systems Hermes 450 UAV in the service of the Brazilian Air Force.[19]
 Colombia – In March 2010, a $28 million contract for Hermes 450 UAVs was suspended by the Colombian government after media reports based on anonymous letters alleged that Colombian officials had been bribed.[20][21] The Israeli Ministry of Defense investigated and found that the letters likely came from Israel Aerospace Industries, a competitor that lost the tender.[20] The incident led to a review of the regulations governing overseas competition between Israeli defense companies.[20]
Divestment[edit]
On September 3, 2009, the Norwegian Pension Fund's ethical council decided to sell the fund's stocks in Elbit due to the corporations supply of surveillance systems for the Israeli West Bank barrier.[22] At a press conference to announce the decision, Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen said "We do not wish to fund companies that so directly contribute to violations of international humanitarian law". The Norwegian Ambassador to Israel was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry where the decision was protested.[23]
In January 2010, Danske Bank added Elbit to the list of companies that fail its Socially Responsible Investment policy; a bank spokesman noted that it was acting in the interests of its customers by not 'placing their money in companies that violate international standards'.[24][25] The Danish financial watchdog Danwatch has also placed Elbit on its ethical blacklist,[26] and one of Denmark's largest pension fund administrators PKA Ltd announced it will no longer consider investing in Elbit, stating "The ICJ stated that the barrier only serves military purposes and violates Palestinian human rights. Therefore we have looked at whether companies produce custom-designed products to the wall and thus has a particular involvement in repressive activities."[25]
In March 2010, a Swedish pension fund not wanting to be associated with companies which in its opinion are violating international treaties, boycotted Elbit Systems for being involved in constructing the Israeli West Bank security fence.[27]

History[edit]
Early years – A division within Elron[edit]
Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (TASE: ELRN), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers). Elbit steadily expanded developing and producing logistic-support weapon delivery and navigation systems for most Israeli aircraft, establishing a combat avionics package for the IAI Lavi fighter aircraft, and producing a fire-control system for the Merkava tank.[1]
1996 IPO on NASDAQ[edit]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF – During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit, the company had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market with the symbol NASDAQ:ESLT and finished its first day of trading at a price of $7.75. Elbit Systems has a market cap of over $3 Billion.
Elbit – which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002, Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003–2006 for approximately $160 million.

Merger with El-Op[edit]
In 2000, Elbit Systems merged with El-Op (a company controlled by the current Chairman, Michael Federmann), creating the largest non governmental defense electronics company in Israel and increasing Elbit Systems' value which later in 2004 enabled Elron to sell its shares in Elbit Systems for approximately $200 million. Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann became the largest shareholder in the combined group.
Growth by acquisition[edit]
Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann and CEO Joseph Ackerman led an aggressive growth by acquisitions strategy.
The company acquired companies, including:

Elisra
Tadiran Communications
Shiron Satellite Communications
BVR Systems
Assets of Israel Military Industries’ Aircraft Systems Division
Innovative Concepts, Inc.
Mikal Ltd (the company initially purchased 19% of the firm, and later agreed to acquire Mikal's 100% holdings in Soltam Systems and Saymar and the 87.85% portion of ITL held by Mikal, in exchange Mikal's owners received the 19% of Mikal that Elbit had purchased)[2] Elbit subsequently announced a cash tender offer for the 12.15% remainder of ITL held by the public.[3]

Recent news[edit]
In October 2014, Elbit Systems won a $12.7 million contract for the supply and provision of Apache Aviator Integrated Helmets for the US Army helicopter fleet. The contract would be delivered over a two-year period.[4]

History[edit]
Early years – A division within Elron[edit]
Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (TASE: ELRN), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers). Elbit steadily expanded developing and producing logistic-support weapon delivery and navigation systems for most Israeli aircraft, establishing a combat avionics package for the IAI Lavi fighter aircraft, and producing a fire-control system for the Merkava tank.[1]
1996 IPO on NASDAQ[edit]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF – During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit, the company had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market with the symbol NASDAQ:ESLT and finished its first day of trading at a price of $7.75. Elbit Systems has a market cap of over $3 Billion.
Elbit – which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002, Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003–2006 for approximately $160 million.

Merger with El-Op[edit]
In 2000, Elbit Systems merged with El-Op (a company controlled by the current Chairman, Michael Federmann), creating the largest non governmental defense electronics company in Israel and increasing Elbit Systems' value which later in 2004 enabled Elron to sell its shares in Elbit Systems for approximately $200 million. Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann became the largest shareholder in the combined group.
Growth by acquisition[edit]
Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann and CEO Joseph Ackerman led an aggressive growth by acquisitions strategy.
The company acquired companies, including:

Elisra
Tadiran Communications
Shiron Satellite Communications
BVR Systems
Assets of Israel Military Industries’ Aircraft Systems Division
Innovative Concepts, Inc.
Mikal Ltd (the company initially purchased 19% of the firm, and later agreed to acquire Mikal's 100% holdings in Soltam Systems and Saymar and the 87.85% portion of ITL held by Mikal, in exchange Mikal's owners received the 19% of Mikal that Elbit had purchased)[2] Elbit subsequently announced a cash tender offer for the 12.15% remainder of ITL held by the public.[3]

Recent news[edit]
In October 2014, Elbit Systems won a $12.7 million contract for the supply and provision of Apache Aviator Integrated Helmets for the US Army helicopter fleet. The contract would be delivered over a two-year period.[4]

According to the agreement, the C-130 aircraft will be installed with various types of advanced electronic systems, including those produced by Elbit Systems' wholly owned subsidiary – Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. The project, to be performed over four years, will be executed in cooperation with local companies in Romania, led by the Romanian Aeronautical Industry.[9]
 United Kingdom – In 2005 Elbit set up a joint venture company in the UK with Thales, UAV Tactical Systems Ltd (U-TacS), developing the British Army Watchkeeper WK450.

North America[edit]
 United States – Elbit owns several companies in the United States through its American subsidiary, Elbit Systems of America (ESA):

EFW in Fort Worth, Texas (the EFW facility also houses ESA's home office)

EFW manufactures various components for the F-16, V-22, and Bradley Fighting Vehicle, among other programs. It was initially the electronics manufacturing facility for General Dynamics operations in Fort Worth; when GD sold its aviation business to Lockheed Martin the latter was not interested in the facility which was then sold to Elbit.[12]


IEI in Talladega, Alabama (formerly International Enterprises, Inc.)
Kollsman Inc. in Merrimack, New Hampshire (founded in 1928 by Paul Kollsman, who invented barometers and instrument flight in airplanes)

Kollsman is a subcontractor to Boeing on SBInet, a high-tech security system for the U.S.-Mexico border in conjunction with the United States Department of Homeland Security.[13]

M7 Aerospace in San Antonio, Texas[16]

South America[edit]
 Brazil – In 2001, Aeroeletronica (AEL), a Brazilian company that had more than two decades of experience in the defense industry has become a part of the Elbit Systems Group.[17] In January 2011, Elbit announced that it had bought two more Brazilian companies: Ares Aeroespecial e Defesa, and Periscopio Equipamentos Optronicos.[18] In April 2011, Embraer has entered into a strategic agreement with AEL Sistemas S.A (“AEL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. The two companies were yet to define the specific programs to be pursued but, according to officials from the two companies, the main goals of the cooperation were the expanding of joint activities in the area of unmanned aircraft systems, including the anticipated creation of a jointly owned company, with majority participation of Embraer D&S. One of the primary goals of the joint venture will be to promote the introduction and use of Elbit Systems Hermes 450 UAV in the service of the Brazilian Air Force.[19]
 Colombia – In March 2010, a $28 million contract for Hermes 450 UAVs was suspended by the Colombian government after media reports based on anonymous letters alleged that Colombian officials had been bribed.[20][21] The Israeli Ministry of Defense investigated and found that the letters likely came from Israel Aerospace Industries, a competitor that lost the tender.[20] The incident led to a review of the regulations governing overseas competition between Israeli defense companies.[20]
Divestment[edit]
On September 3, 2009, the Norwegian Pension Fund's ethical council decided to sell the fund's stocks in Elbit due to the corporations supply of surveillance systems for the Israeli West Bank barrier.[22] At a press conference to announce the decision, Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen said "We do not wish to fund companies that so directly contribute to violations of international humanitarian law". The Norwegian Ambassador to Israel was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry where the decision was protested.[23]
In January 2010, Danske Bank added Elbit to the list of companies that fail its Socially Responsible Investment policy; a bank spokesman noted that it was acting in the interests of its customers by not 'placing their money in companies that violate international standards'.[24][25] The Danish financial watchdog Danwatch has also placed Elbit on its ethical blacklist,[26] and one of Denmark's largest pension fund administrators PKA Ltd announced it will no longer consider investing in Elbit, stating "The ICJ stated that the barrier only serves military purposes and violates Palestinian human rights. Therefore we have looked at whether companies produce custom-designed products to the wall and thus has a particular involvement in repressive activities."[25]
In March 2010, a Swedish pension fund not wanting to be associated with companies which in its opinion are violating international treaties, boycotted Elbit Systems for being involved in constructing the Israeli West Bank security fence.[27]

History[edit]
See also: Elron Electronic Industries
The origins of Elbit Medical Imaging can be traced to 1990, when Elbit's medical arm, at the time a subsidiary of Elron, acquired a majority share in Elscint. Elscint was a company founded in 1969, which developed medical imaging equipment such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1996, Elbit was spun off into three independent companies, and Elbit Medical Imaging was created as separate NASDAQ listed company (ticker symbol:EMITF).[2]
During 1999 and 2000Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to GE Healthcare and to Picker (now Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.[2]
In 1999 Elron Electronic Industries sold all its holdings in Elbit Medical Imaging to Europe Israel Ltd., formerly an Israeli company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and controlled by real estate developer Mordechai (Moti) Zisser, for a sum of approximately $127.8 million.[1]
Following the acquisition in May 1999, Zisser integrated his existing real estate activities into the company and restructured Elbit Medical Imaging as a holding company, focusing on: real estate and hotels development, shopping and entertainment malls, industrial manufacturing and supply of components for the medical imaging; and venture capital investments in high-technology and bio-technology companies.[3]
In 2005 Elscint, which was the first Israeli company to be listed on NASDAQ in 1972, was delisted and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Medical Imaging. At that time, Elscint was no longer engaged in its original medical imaging equipment activities.
On November 1, 2006, Plaza Centers N.V., an indirect subsidiary of Elbit Imaging, was listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company raised approximately £166 million of gross proceeds and its shares are traded under the ticker "PLAZ". On October 19, 2007 Plaza Centers N.V.s shares were also listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange under the ticker "PLZ".[4]
In August 2007, Elbit Imaging sold its Arena Plaza Mall in Budapest, Hungary to Active Asset Investment Management (aAIM), a company chaired by Sir Alex Ferguson, for €400m. The mall was still under construction and was opened in November 2007 by Sir Alex.[5]
In November 2007 the company's name was changed from Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd. to Elbit Imaging Ltd.

History[edit]
See also: Elron Electronic Industries
The origins of Elbit Medical Imaging can be traced to 1990, when Elbit's medical arm, at the time a subsidiary of Elron, acquired a majority share in Elscint. Elscint was a company founded in 1969, which developed medical imaging equipment such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1996, Elbit was spun off into three independent companies, and Elbit Medical Imaging was created as separate NASDAQ listed company (ticker symbol:EMITF).[2]
During 1999 and 2000Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to GE Healthcare and to Picker (now Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million.[2]
In 1999 Elron Electronic Industries sold all its holdings in Elbit Medical Imaging to Europe Israel Ltd., formerly an Israeli company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and controlled by real estate developer Mordechai (Moti) Zisser, for a sum of approximately $127.8 million.[1]
Following the acquisition in May 1999, Zisser integrated his existing real estate activities into the company and restructured Elbit Medical Imaging as a holding company, focusing on: real estate and hotels development, shopping and entertainment malls, industrial manufacturing and supply of components for the medical imaging; and venture capital investments in high-technology and bio-technology companies.[3]
In 2005 Elscint, which was the first Israeli company to be listed on NASDAQ in 1972, was delisted and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Medical Imaging. At that time, Elscint was no longer engaged in its original medical imaging equipment activities.
On November 1, 2006, Plaza Centers N.V., an indirect subsidiary of Elbit Imaging, was listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company raised approximately £166 million of gross proceeds and its shares are traded under the ticker "PLAZ". On October 19, 2007 Plaza Centers N.V.s shares were also listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange under the ticker "PLZ".[4]
In August 2007, Elbit Imaging sold its Arena Plaza Mall in Budapest, Hungary to Active Asset Investment Management (aAIM), a company chaired by Sir Alex Ferguson, for €400m. The mall was still under construction and was opened in November 2007 by Sir Alex.[5]
In November 2007 the company's name was changed from Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd. to Elbit Imaging Ltd.
