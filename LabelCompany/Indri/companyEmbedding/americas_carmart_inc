                            Gene Chailland, the GM of Car-Mart in Cullman, AL is a big believer in second chances.  After joining Car-Mart in March 2012 and becoming GM of Albertville, Gene left the company in December 2013.  However, his love for the company and its people brought him back to Car-Mart in Gadsden as an Account Rep in July 2014.  Gene’s success lead to him being promoted to Sr. Account Rep, then Assistant Manager and finally GM of Cullman, AL in August 2016.  Gene is a good example of second chances!

	W
	I T N E S S E T H

	:






	 





	WHEREAS,
	the Company is engaged in the business of the sale and financing of used vehicles (“Company Business”); and





	 





	WHEREAS,


	the Associate is a Senior Executive Officer of the Company, and
	the Company desires to continue the employment of the Associate, and the Associate desires to provide his services to the Company
	upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;




	 




	WHEREAS,


	the Company periodically sells its finance receivables to Colonial
	Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (“Colonial”) and services those loans on Colonial’s behalf (collectively,
	the Company and Colonial are referred to herein as “Car-Mart”); and




	 




	WHEREAS,


	America’s Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation (the “Parent
	Company”), owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Company;




	 




	WHEREAS,
	in order to conduct its business, the Company owns and uses trade secrets as defined under applicable law, as well as confidential
	and propriety information; and




	 




	WHEREAS,
	the Associate, during the term of his employment with the Company and in order to carry out his duties with the Company, has or
	will have contact with the Company’s customers and employees and has or will have access to and has or will become privy
	to or acquainted with certain confidential information and trade secrets, which are owned by the Company and which are regularly
	used in the business of the Company and which are generally not known to its competitors;




	 




	NOW,
	THEREFORE,


	in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
	contained herein, the parties hereto, each intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:




	 




	1.       

	Employment

	.
	The Company hereby continues the employment of the Associate as a Senior Executive Officer of the Company, and the Associate accepts
	such employment. During the term of employment under this Agreement (the “Employment Term”), the Associate shall perform
	such duties as shall reasonably be required of a Senior Executive Officer of the Company. The Associate further agrees to perform,
	without additional compensation, such other work for the Company and for any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company in which the
	Company has an interest, including, without limitation, Colonial and the Parent Company, as the Board of Directors of the Company
	or the Parent Company shall from time to time reasonably specify. It is expressly agreed and understood between the Company and
	the Associate that the term of this Agreement is in no way dependent upon the Associate’s holding or being elected to any
	office of the Company. The Associate may be deemed an employee of, and paid by the Company, Colonial, or the Parent Company, as
	reasonably determined by the Company.




	 




	 







	*

	Filed under application for confidential treatment.




	 






	 




	 





	2.       

	Performance

	.
	The Associate agrees to devote his entire business efforts to the performance of his duties hereunder, provided, however, that
	the Associate may engage in personal investment activities not involving the Company so long as they do not interfere with the
	performance of his duties hereunder.




	 




	3.       

	Term

	.
	Unless otherwise terminated in accordance with Sections 8, 9, 10 or 11, the Employment Term shall be for a term ending April 30,
	2020. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive additional Employment Terms of one (1) year each unless notice
	of termination is given in writing by either party to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
	initial Employment Term or any renewal Employment Term.




	 








	4.





	Compensation

	.






	 




	(a)       Base
	Salary and Benefits. The basic annual salary of the Associate for his employment services hereunder shall be $466,400 or such
	higher annual salary, if any, as shall be approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent Company from time to time (the “Base
	Salary”), which shall be payable in accordance with the Company’s payroll policy. Nothing contained herein shall affect
	or in any way limit the Associate’s rights as an Associate of the Company to participate in any Company 401(k) profit sharing
	plan or medical and life insurance programs offered by the Company to its employees, all of which shall be available to the Associate
	to the same extent as if this Agreement had not existed, and compensation received by the Associate hereunder shall be in addition
	to the foregoing. In addition, nothing contained herein shall affect or in any way limit the Associate’s eligibility to
	participate in any nonqualified deferred compensation plan of the Company or the Parent.




	 




	(b)       Bonus.
	In addition to the Base Salary and fringe benefits described above, the Associate shall be eligible to earn an annual cash bonus
	(the “Bonus”) during the term hereof beginning May 1, 2015 and ending April 30, 2020. The Bonus shall be based upon
	Parent Company’s projected fully diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP for each fiscal year (“GAAP
	Earnings Per Share”). The Bonus will depend on the Parent Company attaining a minimum of 95% of its projected GAAP Earnings
	Per Share, as set forth in

	Appendix A

	to this Agreement. The Bonus, if any, shall be paid each fiscal year, within fifteen
	(15) days following the Parent Company’s filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year (but no later than
	two and one-half (2½) months following the calendar year in which the Bonus was earned), based upon the Parent Company’s
	GAAP Earnings Per Share for that fiscal year. Any Bonus shall be deemed to be earned by the Associate if the Associate was an
	employee of the Company as of the last day of the fiscal year in question.

	vest) on April 30, 2020, subject to the Associate’s continuous service (as that term is defined in the Option Plan) as of
	the vesting date; and




	 




	(B)       A
	non-qualified stock option to purchase 20,000 shares of Parent Company Stock, with vesting of such option subject to the attainment
	of certain performance conditions based on the Parent Company’s consolidated net income growth during fiscal years 2016
	through 2020. If the Parent Company’s cumulative consolidated net income growth, calculated on a compound basis, for the
	five (5) fiscal years ending April 30, 2020 is equal to 10% or more, the stock option will “cliff” vest in its entirety
	(20,000 shares) on the date which marks the fifth (5

	th

	) anniversary of the stock option grant date (the “Vesting
	Date”). If the Parent Company’s cumulative consolidated net income growth, calculated on a compound basis, for the
	five (5) fiscal years ending April 30, 2020 is equal to 5% or more but less than 10%, the stock option will “cliff”
	vest as to 10,000 shares on the Vesting Date. If the Company’s cumulative consolidated net income growth, calculated on
	a compound basis, for the five (5) fiscal years ending April 30, 2020 is less than 5%, the stock option will be forfeited.




	 




	(ii)       For
	purposes of this Section 4(c), “consolidated net income” for a given fiscal year shall mean “Net income”
	as reported in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
	10-K for such fiscal year as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, except that if on the Vesting Date the Company
	has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020, “consolidated net income”
	for fiscal year 2020 shall be the Company’s “Net income” as reported in the Company’s public earnings
	press release for such fiscal year. All terms used in this Section 4(c) shall have the definitions set forth in this Agreement,
	the Option Plan or the applicable Stock Option Agreement, as the case may be.




	 




	(iii)       The
	stock option grants under this Section 4(c) shall be made on August 5, 2015, the date of the Parent Company’s annual meeting
	of shareholders, subject to and contingent upon the approval by such shareholders of the Option Plan.

	5.       

	Expense
	Account and Vacations

	. Matters relating to expense accounts for the Associate, vacations and the like shall be mutually agreed
	upon from time to time. However, the Company agrees to reimburse the Associate for all expenses reasonably incurred by him on
	behalf of the Company in accordance with the prevailing practices and policies of the Company. In addition, the Associate shall
	be entitled to that number of days of paid vacation and paid sick leave as is consistent with the prevailing practices and policies
	of the Company for other employees in the same or similar position as that held by the Associate hereunder.

	Non-Solicitation, Non-Disclosure, and Confidentiality Provisions





	 




	(a)       Non-Solicitation:
	Customers. During Associate’s employment and for one (1) year immediately following the cessation of Associate’s employment
	with the Company for any reason, Associate shall not, on his own behalf or on behalf of any person, firm, partnership, association,
	corporation or business organization, entity or enterprise (except the Company), solicit, call upon, or attempt to solicit or
	call upon, any customer of the Company, or any representative of any customer of the Company with a view to selling or providing
	any product or service competitive with any product or service sold or provided by the Company in the Company Business, as defined
	herein, during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding cessation of Associate’s employment with the Company,
	provided that the restrictions set forth in this section shall apply only to customers of the Company, or representatives of customers
	of the Company with whom Associate had material contact during such twelve (12) month period. “Material contact” exists
	between Associate and each of the Company’s existing customers: (i) with whom Associate actually dealt for a business purpose
	while employed by the Company or to further a business relationship between the customer and the Company; or (ii) whose business
	dealings with the Company were handled, coordinated or supervised by Associate or performed by Associate in whole or in part.




	 




	(b)       Non-Solicitation:
	Employees. During Associate’s employment and for one (1) year immediately following the cessation of Associate’s employment
	with the Company for any reason, Associate will not solicit or in any manner encourage employees of the Company to leave the employ

	(c)       Non-Disclosure.




	 




	(i)       TRADE
	SECRETS. Associate acknowledges that the Company owns and uses trade secrets as defined under applicable law. “Trade secret(s)”
	means information, without regard to form, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern,
	a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans,
	or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which information:
	(a) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper
	means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (b) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable
	under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. Associate further acknowledges that in the course of Associate’s employment
	with the Company and in order to carry out Associate’s duties thereunder, Associate has or will become privy to the Trade
	Secrets of the Company. Accordingly, Associate shall not disclose, divulge, publish to others, or use for any purpose, except
	as necessary to perform Associate’s duties while employed by the Company, any Trade Secret of the Company without the prior
	written consent of the Company, for so long as such information shall remain a Trade Secret under applicable law.




	 




	(ii)       CONFIDENTIAL
	INFORMATION. Associate acknowledges that in order to conduct its business, the Company owns and uses written and unwritten confidential
	information. “Confidential Information” means data and information relating to the business of the Company (which
	may not rise to the level of a Trade Secret under applicable law) which is or has been disclosed to Associate or of which Associate
	became aware as a consequence of or through Associate’s relationship with the Company and which has value to the Company
	and is not generally known to its competitors. Confidential Information shall not include any data or information that has been
	voluntarily disclosed to the public by the Company (except where such public disclosure has been made by Associate without authorization)
	or that has been independently developed and disclosed by others, or that otherwise enters the public domain through lawful means.
	Associate further acknowledges that in the course of his employment with the Company and in order to carry out his duties thereunder,
	Associate has or will become privy to Confidential Information of the Company. Accordingly, Associate agrees that while employed
	by the Company, and for a period of two (2) years from the conclusion of Associate’s employment with the Company for any
	reason, Associate will not disclose, divulge, publish to others or use for any purpose any Confidential Information of the Company
	except to the extent necessary to perform his duties and responsibilities as an Associate for the Company, without the prior written
	consent of the Company.

	(iii)       NOTICE
	OF TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Associate acknowledges that the Company hereby designates Trade Secrets and Confidential
	Information to include, by way of illustration but not limitation, confidential customer and prospective customer lists; information
	provided to the Company by its customers or clients or prospective customers or clients; customer preferences; client contacts;
	marketing plans, presentations and strategies; products; processes; designs; formulas; methods; clinical data; licenses; software;
	computer or electronic data disks or tapes; processes; research and plans for research; computer programs; methods of operations
	and costs data; contracts; personnel information; credit terms; financial information (including without limitation information
	regarding fee and pricing structures, assets, status of client accounts or credit); or any other information designated as a trade
	secret, confidential or proprietary by the Company.




	 




	(iv)       TREATMENT
	OF TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Associate understands and agrees to treat whatever information the Company wants
	to protect from disclosure as genuinely “confidential”,

	i.e.

	, restricting access by pass code, stamping hardcopies
	of customer lists “confidential,” and restricting access to the customer list to designated and appropriate personnel,
	and the like. Associate further agrees, as an Associate, to use his best efforts and the utmost diligence to guard and protect
	the Company’s Trade Secrets and Confidential Information from disclosure to any competitor, customer or supplier of the
	Company or any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, unless such disclosure has been specifically authorized by the
	Company in writing.




	 




	(d)       Non-Competition.
	Associate acknowledges that the Company is engaged in the Company Business as defined herein. Associate further acknowledges that
	the Company Business is primarily concentrated in and focused in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri,
	Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas (hereinafter the “Territory”), and that Associate’s duties and responsibilities
	were not limited to any particular area within that region but will be within and throughout the entire Territory, and rendered
	in connection with Company Business. Associate further agrees and acknowledges that because of his association with the Company
	and his access to Trade Secrets and confidential, proprietary information of the Company which relate to the Company Business
	as herein defined, Associate’s competition with the Company as or with a direct competitor in the same line of business
	as the Company would damage and impair the business of the Company. Therefore, during the term of his employment and for a period
	of one (1) year from the conclusion of Associate’s employment with the Company for any reason, Associate shall not, for
	himself or on behalf of any other person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, business organization, entity or enterprise,
	perform duties which are substantially similar to the duties performed by Associate on behalf of Company within the Territory
	for any business engaged in the Company Business as defined herein.

	of Work Product. For purposes of this Agreement, “Work Product” shall mean the data, materials, documentation, computer
	programs, inventions (whether or not patentable), and all works of authorship, including all worldwide rights therein under patent,
	copyright, trade secret, confidential information, and other property rights, created or developed in whole or in part by Associate,
	relating to the Company Business whether prior to the date of this Agreement or in the future, either (i) while employed by the
	Company and that have been or will be paid for by the Company, or (ii) while employed by the Company (whether developed during
	working hours or not) and not otherwise the subject of a written agreement between the Company and Associate. All Work Product
	shall be considered work made for hire by Associate and owned by the Company. If any of the Work Product may not, by operation
	of law, be considered work made for hire by Associate for the Company, or if ownership of all rights, title, and interest of the
	intellectual property rights therein shall not otherwise vest exclusively in the Company, Associate hereby assigns to the Company,
	and upon the future creation thereof automatically assigns to the Company without further consideration, the ownership of all
	Work Product. The Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its own name patents, copyrights, registrations and any other
	protection available in the Work Product. Associate agrees to perform, during and after his employment, such further acts as may
	be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend the Company’s ownership of the Work Product as reasonably requested
	by the Company.




	 




	(f)       Return
	of Company Property. All Company property, including, but not limited to, equipment, devices, records, correspondence, documents,
	files, reports, studies, manuals, compilations, drawings, blueprints, sketches, videos, memoranda, computer software and programs,
	data or any other information, including Trade Secrets and Confidential Information as set forth herein, (whether originals, copies
	or extracts, stored in any medium), whether prepared or developed by Associate or otherwise coming into Associate’s possession,
	whether maintained by Associate in the facilities of the Company, at Associate’s home, or at any other location, is, and
	shall remain, the exclusive property of the Company and shall be promptly delivered to the Company, with no copies or reproductions
	retained by Associate, in the event of Associate’s termination for any reason, or at any other time or times the Company
	may request. Upon termination of employment for any reason, Associate agrees to sign and deliver the “Termination Certification”
	attached hereto as

	Appendix B

	.




	 




	(g)       Reasonable
	Restrictions. Associate agrees and acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary
	in order to protect the valuable proprietary assets, goodwill and business of the Company and that the restrictions will not prevent
	or unreasonably restrict his ability to earn a livelihood. Associate also agrees and acknowledges that if his employment with
	the Company ends for any reason, Associate will be able to earn a livelihood without violating the restrictions contained in this
	Agreement and that Associate’s ability to earn a livelihood without violating said restrictions is an important reason in
	Associate choosing to sign this Agreement.

	7.       

	Remedies

	.
	The Associate expressly agrees that the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of Section 6 will be inadequate and that
	upon any such breach or threatened breach, the Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to injunctive relief in any court
	of competent jurisdiction, in equity or otherwise, to enforce the specific performance of the Associate’s obligations under
	these provisions without the necessity of proving the actual damage to the Company or the inadequacy of a legal remedy.

	nature in connection with the performance of such duties; or




	 




	(iv)       the

	Termination
	Without Cause

	. The Company shall have the right to terminate the Employment Term without Cause at any time. If the termination

	continue to be payable in accordance with the Company’s payroll policy through the Employment Term, (ii) the Associate
	shall be paid within sixty (60) days after termination the pro rata portion of the Bonus earned, if any, through the date of termination,
	(iii) all outstanding and unvested stock options previously granted to the Associate by the Parent Company shall immediately vest

	Plan (or successor plan) or the stock option agreements between the Parent Company and the Associate with respect to such stock
	options, and (iv) all outstanding and unvested shares of restricted stock (if any) previously granted to the Associate by the
	Parent Company shall immediately vest in full without regard to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions, unless
	otherwise prohibited by the Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) (or successor plan) or
	the restricted stock agreements between the Parent Company and the Associate with respect to such restricted stock awards; provided,
	however, that any shares of restricted stock that are intended to constitute performance-based compensation within the meaning
	of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), shall become vested only to the extent
	provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable restricted stock agreement and the provisions of this Section 9 shall not apply
	to any shares of restricted stock that are intended to constitute performance-based compensation. Bonus payments to the Associate

	Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, the Associate shall not be entitled to receive any of the payments or benefits described in Section 9 unless, not

	becomes effective, shall be accumulated and paid to the Associate on the first payroll date following the date the Release becomes
	effective, without interest, or, if such sixty-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, the
	first payroll date during the second calendar year following the date the Release becomes effective, as described above.




	 




	10.

	of the Associate

	. If the Associate dies during the Employment Term, the Employment Term shall terminate, and within 60 days
	after death, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, the Company will pay to the Associate’s estate (i) the
	Associate’s Base Salary then in effect through the end of the calendar month in which such death occurs, and (ii) the
	pro rata portion of the Bonus earned, if any, through the date of death. In addition, all outstanding and unvested stock options
	previously granted to the Associate by the Parent Company shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement of
	any applicable performance conditions, unless otherwise prohibited by the Option Plan (or successor plan) or the stock option
	agreements between the Parent Company and the Associate with respect to such stock options, and all outstanding and unvested shares
	of restricted stock (if any) previously granted to the Associate by the Parent Company shall immediately vest in full, without

	Term, in which event the Company will pay to the Associate the Associate’s Base Salary then in effect, payable in accordance
	with the Company’s payroll policy through the end of the Employment Term; provided, however, any amounts payable to the
	Associate under the Company’s disability insurance policy shall be deducted from the amounts payable to the Associate hereunder.
	For the purposes of this Agreement, the Associate shall be deemed to be “disabled” when, by reason of any medically
	determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a period of
	not less than twelve (12) consecutive months, he has received replacement income for a period of at least three (3) months under
	the Company’s disability insurance policy, or if the Company does not have a disability insurance policy for the Associate,
	the Associate shall be deemed disabled if he is unable to perform his services or discharge his duties as an Associate of the
	Company by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be
	expected to last for a period of not less than twelve (12) consecutive months. Any disability, as defined herein, shall not constitute
	“Cause” for purposes of Section 8(b) hereof. In addition, all outstanding and unvested stock options previously granted
	to the Associate by the Parent Company shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement of any applicable performance
	conditions, unless otherwise prohibited by the Option Plan (or successor plan) or the stock option agreements between the Parent
	Company and the Associate with respect to such stock options, and all outstanding and unvested shares of restricted stock (if
	any) previously granted to the Associate by the Parent Company shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement

	12.       

	Change
	in Control of the Parent Company





	 




	(a)       If
	a Double Trigger Event (as defined in Section 12(c) herein) occurs in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in Section
	12(b) herein) of the Parent Company, on the sixty-day anniversary of the date of the Double Trigger Event, (i) the Company shall
	pay to the Associate a lump sum cash payment equal to 2.99 times the Associate’s Base Salary in effect immediately prior
	to the Change in Control; (ii) all outstanding and unvested stock options previously granted to the Associate by the Parent Company
	shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions, unless otherwise prohibited
	by the Option Plan (or successor plan) or the stock option agreements between the Parent Company and the Associate with respect
	to such stock options; and (iii) all outstanding and unvested shares of restricted stock (if any) previously granted to the Associate
	by the Parent Company shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions,
	unless otherwise prohibited by the Incentive Plan (or successor plan) or the restricted stock agreements between the Parent Company
	and the Associate with respect to such restricted stock awards (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to as the “Change
	in Control Payments”).




	 











	 



	10



	 







	 





	Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, the Associate shall not be entitled to receive any of the payments or benefits described in Section 12 unless,
	not later than sixty (60) days after the termination date, the Associate has executed a release of claims against the Company
	and its affiliates (the “Release”), and the period during which the Release may be revoked has expired without the
	Associate having revoked the Release. None of the payments or benefits described in Section 12 shall be paid until the Release
	has been signed and become effective, and any payments, which would otherwise be payable during such sixty-day period prior to
	the date the Release becomes effective, shall be accumulated and paid to the Associate on the first payroll date following the
	date the Release becomes effective, without interest, or, if such sixty-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second
	calendar year, the first payroll date during the second calendar year following the date the Release becomes effective, as described
	above.




	 




	(b)       For
	purposes of this Section 12, “Change in Control” of the Parent Company shall mean:




	 




	(i)       Change
	in Ownership. The acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
	of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) (a “Person”) of ownership of stock of the Parent Company that, together
	with stock held by such Person, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of
	the Parent Company. However, if any Person is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value of total voting power
	of the stock of the Parent Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same Person is not considered to cause a change
	in ownership of the Parent Company (or to cause a change in the effective control of the Parent Company). An increase in the percentage
	of stock owned by any one Person as a result of a transaction in which the Parent Company acquires its stock in exchange for property
	will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this paragraph. This paragraph applies only when there is a transfer
	of stock of the Parent Company (or issuance of stock of the Parent Company) and stock in the Parent Company remains outstanding
	after the transaction; or




	 




	(ii)       Change
	in Effective Control. (A) the acquisition by any Person during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition
	by such Person, of ownership of stock of the Parent Company possessing 35% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the
	Parent Company; or (B) the replacement of a majority of members of the Parent Company’s Board of Directors during any 12-month
	period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Parent Company’s Board
	of Directors prior to the date of the appointment or election.




	 




	A
	change in effective control also may occur in any transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the transaction
	has a “Change in Ownership” under paragraph (i) or “Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of the Company’s
	Assets” under paragraph (iii). If any one Person is considered to effectively control the Parent Company, the acquisition
	of additional control of the Parent Company by the same Person is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of
	the Parent Company (or to cause a “Change in Ownership” of the Parent Company within the meaning of paragraph (i)
	above); or




	 











	 



	11



	 







	 





	(iii)       Change
	in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets. The acquisition by any Person during the 12-month period ending on the date of
	the most recent acquisition by such Person, of assets from the Parent Company that have a total gross fair market value equal
	to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Parent Company immediately prior to such
	acquisition(s). For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Parent Company, or the value of
	the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. No Change in Control shall
	be deemed to have occurred in the event of a transfer to a related person or as described in Code Section 409A.




	 




	The
	definition of Change in Control in this Subsection 12(b), and all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall be interpreted
	at all times in such a manner as to comply with Code Section 409A, meaning that no additional income tax is imposed on the Associate
	pursuant to Code Section 409A(1)(a).




	 




	(c)       For
	purposes of this Section 12, a “Double Trigger Event” shall be deemed to occur if, within the period beginning six
	(6) months prior to a Change in Control and ending two (2) years following such Change in Control, (i) the Associate’s employment
	is involuntarily terminated by the Company or the Parent Company (or the surviving or acquiring entity, as the case may be), other
	than for Cause, or (ii) the Associate terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in Section 12(d) herein). If the termination
	of the Associate’s employment, as contemplated by this Section 12(c), occurs prior to the Change in Control, then the Associate
	shall be treated for purposes of this Section 12 as being employed on the date the Change in Control becomes effective and the
	Associate’s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to such termination shall be deemed in effect, for purposes of this
	Section 12, immediately prior to the Change in Control. For purposes of this Section 12, the date of the Double Trigger Event
	shall be the later of the effective date of the Change in Control and the date of the Associate’s termination of employment
	as contemplated in this Section 12(c).




	 




	(d)       For
	purposes of this Section 12, “Good Reason” shall mean:




	 




	(i)
	       If the Associate is a party to an employment or service agreement with the Company,
	the Parent Company or an affiliate of the Company that supersedes and replaces, in whole or in part, any provisions of this Agreement
	and such agreement provides for a definition of Good Reason, the definition contained therein; or




	 




	(ii)       If
	no such agreement exists, the Associate’s resignation from the Company within thirty (30) days following the occurrence
	of any of the following events with respect to the Associate:




	 











	 



	12



	 







	 





	(A)       Without
	the Associate’s express written consent, the significant reduction of the Associate’s duties, authority, responsibilities,
	or reporting relationships relative to the Associate’s duties, authority, responsibilities, or reporting relationships as
	in effect immediately prior to such reduction, or the assignment to the Associate of such reduced duties, authority, responsibilities,
	or reporting relationships, which reduction or assigned reduction remains in effect five (5) business days after written notice
	by the Associate to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Parent Company (or the surviving or acquiring
	entity, as the case may be) of such conditions; provided, however, that the mere occurrence of a Change in Control shall not,
	in and of itself, constitute a material adverse change in the Associate’s duties, authority, responsibilities or reporting
	relationships.




	 




	(B)       A
	material reduction by the Company or the Parent Company (or the surviving or acquiring entity, as the case may be) in the Base

	Specified
	Employee Delay

	. If the Associate is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code Section 409A, any benefits
	or payments (including installments and insurance premiums and contributions) which (a) constitute a “deferral of compensation”
	under Code Section 409A, (b) become payable as a result of the Associate’s termination of employment for reasons other than
	death, and (c) become due under this Agreement during the first six (6) months (or such longer period as required by Code Section

	shall be paid to the Associate in full in the seventh (7

	th

	) month after the date of termination and all subsequent
	payments (or installments) shall be paid in accordance with their original payment schedule. To the extent that any insurance
	premiums or other benefit contributions constituting a “deferral of compensation” become subject to the above delay,
	the Associate shall be responsible for paying such amounts directly to the insurer or other third party and shall receive reimbursement
	from Company for such amounts in the seventh (7

	th

	) month as described above. This paragraph shall not apply to payments
	made as a result of a termination of employment that is the result of the Associate’s death.

	17.       

	Compliance
	with Section 409A

	. The payments due under this Agreement are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code (“Code

	Section 409A

	”) or an exemption thereunder and shall be construed and administered in accordance with Section 409A.
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payments of “nonqualified deferred compensation” provided under
	this Agreement may only be made upon an event and in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A or an applicable exemption.
	Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded from Code Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation
	from service or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded from Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. To the extent
	Code Section 409A applies, each installment payment provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. Any
	payments of “nonqualified deferred compensation” to be made under this Agreement by reason of a termination of employment
	shall only be made if such termination of employment constitutes a “separation from service” under Code Section 409A.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement
	comply with Code Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest
	or other expenses that may be incurred by the Associate on account of non-compliance with Code Section 409A. To the extent required
	by Code Section 409A, each reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under this Agreement shall be provided in accordance with
	the following: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during each calendar year
	cannot affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (ii) any
	reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be paid to the Associate on or before the last day of the calendar year following the
	calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and (iii) any right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Agreement
	shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.




	 




	18.       

	Section
	280G

	.




	 




	(a)       In
	the event that the total amount of payments to be received by the Associate, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, that are
	contingent upon a change in ownership or control (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) would, but for this Section
	18(a), be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “

	Excise Tax

	”), then the amount
	of payments to be received by the Associate pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise shall be reduced to the maximum amount that
	will cause the total amounts of the payments not to be subject to the Excise Tax, but only if the amount of such payments, after
	such reduction and after payment of all applicable taxes on the reduced amount, is equal to or greater than the amount of such
	payments the Associate would otherwise be entitled to retain without such reduction after the payment of all applicable taxes,
	including the Excise Tax.




	 




	(b)       The
	accounting firm engaged by the Company for general audit purposes (the “Audit Firm”) shall perform any calculations
	necessary in connection with this Section 18; provided that, if for any reason the Audit Firm is unable to, or declines to, perform
	such calculations, the Company shall engage such other accounting firm as the Audit Firm shall recommend in writing to the Company
	to perform such calculations (the Audit Firm or such other accounting firm, as applicable, being hereinafter referred to as the
	“Accounting Firm”).  The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such Accounting
	Firm required to be made hereunder. The Accounting Firm engaged to make the determinations under this Section 18 shall provide
	its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Associate and the Company within fifteen (15) calendar
	days after the date on which the Associate’s right to a payment contingent on a Change in Control is triggered (if requested
	at that time by Associate or the Company) or such other time as requested by the Associate or the Company.  If the Accounting
	Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to such payments, it shall furnish the Associate and the Company with
	an opinion reasonably acceptable to Associate that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such payments.  Any good
	faith determinations of the Accounting Firm made hereunder shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon Associate and the Company.
	If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting “parachute payments” is required by Section 18(a), the reduction
	shall occur in the following order unless the Associate elects in writing a different order (provided, however, that such election
	shall be subject to the Company’s approval if made on or after the date on which the event that triggers the payment occurs
	and to the extent that such election does not violate Code Section 409A): reduction of cash payments (in reverse order of the
	date on which such cash payments would otherwise be made with the cash payments that would otherwise be made last being reduced
	first); cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock awards; reduction of employee benefits.  In the event that accelerated
	vesting of stock awards is to be reduced, such accelerated vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the grant date of
	the Associate’s stock awards unless the Associate elects in writing a different order for cancellation.

	19.

	Assignability

	. The Associate may not assign his interest in or delegate his duties under this Agreement. The rights and
	obligations of the Company hereunder may be assigned only by operation of law in connection with a merger in which the Company
	is not the surviving corporation or in connection with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company; and in the
	latter event, such assignment shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.




	 




	20.       

	Binding
	Effect

	. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns.




	 




	21.       

	Entire
	Agreement; Modification

	. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject
	matter hereof and may not be modified or amended in any way except in writing by the parties hereto. This Agreement supersedes
	and replaces any and all prior employment agreements between the Company and the Associate, all of which are hereby terminated
	and declared null and void; provided, however, this Agreement shall not affect, in any manner, previously awarded restricted stock
	or stock options, which awards shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such previous awards.




	 




	22.       

	Duration

	.
	Notwithstanding the termination of the Employment Term and of the Associate’s employment by the Company, this Agreement
	shall continue to bind the parties for so long as any obligations remain under this Agreement, and, in particular, the Associate
	shall continue to be bound by the terms of Section 6.




	 




	23.       

	Waiver

	.
	No waiver by the Company of any breach by the Associate of this Agreement shall be construed to be a waiver as to succeeding breaches.




	 




	24.       

	Enforceability

	.
	The covenants and provisions contained herein are severable and are to be interpreted as such to the extent permitted by applicable
	law. The parties understand, acknowledge and agree that should any provision of this Agreement be declared or determined by any
	court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the validity of the remaining parts, terms or provisions
	of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby, and that the Agreement will be amended to delete or modify, as necessary, any
	invalid or unenforceable parts, terms or provisions to the extent necessary to allow for enforcement.

	EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT




	 



	This Employment Agreement (the “Agreement”)
	is made effective as of May 1, 2015 between AMERICA’S CAR MART, INC., an Arkansas corporation (the “Company”)
	and JEFFREY A. WILLIAMS (the “Associate”).


	 




	W I T N E S S E T H

	:




	 



	WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in the business
	of the sale and financing of used vehicles (“Company Business”); and



	 




	WHEREAS,

	the
	Associate is a Senior Executive Officer of the Company, and the Company desires to continue the employment of the Associate, and
	the Associate desires to provide his services to the Company upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;


	 



	WHEREAS,

	the
	Company periodically sells its finance receivables to Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (“Colonial”)
	and services those loans on Colonial’s behalf (collectively, the Company and Colonial are referred to herein as “Car-Mart”);
	and


	 



	WHEREAS,

	America’s
	Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation (the “Parent Company”), owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Company;


	 


	WHEREAS, in order to conduct its business, the
	Company owns and uses trade secrets as defined under applicable law, as well as confidential and propriety information; and


	 


	WHEREAS, the Associate, during the term of his
	employment with the Company and in order to carry out his duties with the Company, has or will have contact with the Company’s
	customers and employees and has or will have access to and has or will become privy to or acquainted with certain confidential
	information and trade secrets, which are owned by the Company and which are regularly used in the business of the Company and which
	are generally not known to its competitors;


	 



	NOW, THEREFORE,

	in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the parties hereto, each intending to be legally
	bound hereby, agree as follows:


	 


	1.       

	Employment

	.
	The Company hereby continues the employment of the Associate as a Senior Executive Officer of the Company, and the Associate accepts
	such employment. During the term of employment under this Agreement (the “Employment Term”), the Associate shall perform
	such duties as shall reasonably be required of a Senior Executive Officer of the Company. The Associate further agrees to perform,
	without additional compensation, such other work for the Company and for any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company in which the
	Company has an interest, including, without limitation, Colonial and the Parent Company, as the Board of Directors of the Company
	or the Parent Company shall from time to time reasonably specify. It is expressly agreed and understood between the Company and
	the Associate that the term of this Agreement is in no way dependent upon the Associate’s holding or being elected to any
	office of the Company. The Associate may be deemed an employee of, and paid by the Company, Colonial, or the Parent Company, as
	reasonably determined by the Company.


	 


	 






	*

	Filed under application for confidential treatment.









	 




	 



	 


	2.       

	Performance

	.
	The Associate agrees to devote his entire business efforts to the performance of his duties hereunder, provided, however, that
	the Associate may engage in personal investment activities not involving the Company so long as they do not interfere with the
	performance of his duties hereunder.


	 


	3.       

	Term

	.
	Unless otherwise terminated in accordance with Sections 8, 9, 10 or 11, the Employment Term shall be for a term ending April 30,
	2020. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive additional Employment Terms of one (1) year each unless notice
	of termination is given in writing by either party to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
	initial Employment Term or any renewal Employment Term.


	 






	4.



	Compensation

	.




	 


	(a)       Base
	Salary and Benefits. The basic annual salary of the Associate for his employment services hereunder shall be $367,290 or such higher
	annual salary, if any, as shall be approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent Company from time to time (the “Base
	Salary”), which shall be payable in accordance with the Company’s payroll policy. Nothing contained herein shall affect
	or in any way limit the Associate’s rights as an Associate of the Company to participate in any Company 401(k) profit sharing
	plan or medical and life insurance programs offered by the Company to its employees, all of which shall be available to the Associate
	to the same extent as if this Agreement had not existed, and compensation received by the Associate hereunder shall be in addition
	to the foregoing. In addition, nothing contained herein shall affect or in any way limit the Associate’s eligibility to participate
	in any nonqualified deferred compensation plan of the Company or the Parent.


	 


	(b)       Bonus.
	In addition to the Base Salary and fringe benefits described above, the Associate shall be eligible to earn an annual cash bonus
	(the “Bonus”) during the term hereof beginning May 1, 2015 and ending April 30, 2020. The Bonus shall be based upon
	Parent Company’s projected fully diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP for each fiscal year (“GAAP
	Earnings Per Share”). The Bonus will depend on the Parent Company attaining a minimum of 95% of its projected GAAP Earnings
	Per Share, as set forth in

	Appendix A

	to this Agreement. The Bonus, if any, shall be paid each fiscal year, within fifteen
	(15) days following the Parent Company’s filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year (but no later than
	two and one-half (2½) months following the calendar year in which the Bonus was earned), based upon the Parent Company’s
	GAAP Earnings Per Share for that fiscal year. Any Bonus shall be deemed to be earned by the Associate if the Associate was an employee
	of the Company as of the last day of the fiscal year in question.

	(c)       Non-Qualified
	Stock Options.


	 


	(i)       Subject
	to Section 4(c)(iii) herein, the Parent Company will grant to the Associate, pursuant to the Parent Company’s Amended and
	Restated Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”), non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 30,000 shares
	of Parent Company Stock, as follows:


	 


	(A)       A
	non-qualified stock option to purchase 10,000 shares of Parent Company Stock, which will vest in full (or “cliff” vest)
	on April 30, 2020, subject to the Associate’s continuous service (as that term is defined in the Option Plan) as of the vesting
	date; and


	 


	(B)       A
	non-qualified stock option to purchase 20,000 shares of Parent Company Stock, with vesting of such option subject to the attainment
	of certain performance conditions based on the Parent Company’s consolidated net income growth during fiscal years 2016 through
	2020. If the Parent Company’s cumulative consolidated net income growth, calculated on a compound basis, for the five (5)
	fiscal years ending April 30, 2020 is equal to 10% or more, the stock option will “cliff” vest in its entirety (20,000
	shares) on the date which marks the fifth (5

	th

	) anniversary of the stock option grant date (the “Vesting Date”).
	If the Parent Company’s cumulative consolidated net income growth, calculated on a compound basis, for the five (5) fiscal
	years ending April 30, 2020 is equal to 5% or more but less than 10%, the stock option will “cliff” vest as to 10,000
	shares on the Vesting Date. If the Company’s cumulative consolidated net income growth, calculated on a compound basis, for
	the five (5) fiscal years ending April 30, 2020 is less than 5%, the stock option will be forfeited.


	 


	(ii)       For
	purposes of this Section 4(c), “consolidated net income” for a given fiscal year shall mean “Net income”
	as reported in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
	for such fiscal year as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, except that if on the Vesting Date the Company has not
	yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020, “consolidated net income” for fiscal
	year 2020 shall be the Company’s “Net income” as reported in the Company’s public earnings press release
	for such fiscal year. All terms used in this Section 4(c) shall have the definitions set forth in this Agreement, the Option Plan
	or the applicable Stock Option Agreement, as the case may be.


	 


	(iii)       The
	stock option grants under this Section 4(c) shall be made on August 5, 2015, the date of the Parent Company’s annual meeting
	of shareholders, subject to and contingent upon the approval by such shareholders of the Option Plan.

	5.       

	Expense
	Account and Vacations

	. Matters relating to expense accounts for the Associate, vacations and the like shall be mutually agreed
	upon from time to time. However, the Company agrees to reimburse the Associate for all expenses reasonably incurred by him on behalf
	of the Company in accordance with the prevailing practices and policies of the Company. In addition, the Associate shall be entitled
	to that number of days of paid vacation and paid sick leave as is consistent with the prevailing practices and policies of the
	Company for other employees in the same or similar position as that held by the Associate hereunder.


	 


	6.       

	Non-Competition,
	Non-Solicitation, Non-Disclosure, and Confidentiality Provisions



	 


	(a)       Non-Solicitation:
	Customers. During Associate’s employment and for one (1) year immediately following the cessation of Associate’s employment
	with the Company for any reason, Associate shall not, on his own behalf or on behalf of any person, firm, partnership, association,
	corporation or business organization, entity or enterprise (except the Company), solicit, call upon, or attempt to solicit or call
	upon, any customer of the Company, or any representative of any customer of the Company with a view to selling or providing any
	product or service competitive with any product or service sold or provided by the Company in the Company Business, as defined
	herein, during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding cessation of Associate’s employment with the Company, provided
	that the restrictions set forth in this section shall apply only to customers of the Company, or representatives of customers of
	the Company with whom Associate had material contact during such twelve (12) month period. “Material contact” exists
	between Associate and each of the Company’s existing customers: (i) with whom Associate actually dealt for a business purpose
	while employed by the Company or to further a business relationship between the customer and the Company; or (ii) whose business
	dealings with the Company were handled, coordinated or supervised by Associate or performed by Associate in whole or in part.



	 




	(b)       Non-Solicitation:
	Employees. During Associate’s employment and for one (1) year immediately following the cessation of Associate’s employment
	with the Company for any reason, Associate will not solicit or in any manner encourage employees of the Company to leave the employ
	of the Company. The foregoing prohibition applies only to employees with whom Associate had material contact pursuant to Associate’s
	duties during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding cessation of Associate’s employment with the Company. “Material
	contact” means interaction between Associate and another employee of the Company: (i) with whom Associate actually dealt

	means information, without regard to form, including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern,
	a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans,
	or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which information:
	(a) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper
	means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (b) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable
	under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. Associate further acknowledges that in the course of Associate’s employment
	with the Company and in order to carry out Associate’s duties thereunder, Associate has or will become privy to the Trade
	Secrets of the Company. Accordingly, Associate shall not disclose, divulge, publish to others, or use for any purpose, except as
	necessary to perform Associate’s duties while employed by the Company, any Trade Secret of the Company without the prior
	written consent of the Company, for so long as such information shall remain a Trade Secret under applicable law.


	 


	(ii)       CONFIDENTIAL
	INFORMATION. Associate acknowledges that in order to conduct its business, the Company owns and uses written and unwritten confidential
	information. “Confidential Information” means data and information relating to the business of the Company (which may
	not rise to the level of a Trade Secret under applicable law) which is or has been disclosed to Associate or of which Associate
	became aware as a consequence of or through Associate’s relationship with the Company and which has value to the Company
	and is not generally known to its competitors. Confidential Information shall not include any data or information that has been
	voluntarily disclosed to the public by the Company (except where such public disclosure has been made by Associate without authorization)
	or that has been independently developed and disclosed by others, or that otherwise enters the public domain through lawful means.
	Associate further acknowledges that in the course of his employment with the Company and in order to carry out his duties thereunder,
	Associate has or will become privy to Confidential Information of the Company. Accordingly, Associate agrees that while employed
	by the Company, and for a period of two (2) years from the conclusion of Associate’s employment with the Company for any
	reason, Associate will not disclose, divulge, publish to others or use for any purpose any Confidential Information of the Company
	except to the extent necessary to perform his duties and responsibilities as an Associate for the Company, without the prior written
	consent of the Company.

	(iii)       NOTICE
	OF TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Associate acknowledges that the Company hereby designates Trade Secrets and Confidential
	Information to include, by way of illustration but not limitation, confidential customer and prospective customer lists; information
	provided to the Company by its customers or clients or prospective customers or clients; customer preferences; client contacts;
	marketing plans, presentations and strategies; products; processes; designs; formulas; methods; clinical data; licenses; software;
	computer or electronic data disks or tapes; processes; research and plans for research; computer programs; methods of operations
	and costs data; contracts; personnel information; credit terms; financial information (including without limitation information
	regarding fee and pricing structures, assets, status of client accounts or credit); or any other information designated as a trade
	secret, confidential or proprietary by the Company.


	 


	(iv)       TREATMENT
	OF TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Associate understands and agrees to treat whatever information the Company wants
	to protect from disclosure as genuinely “confidential”,

	i.e.

	, restricting access by pass code, stamping hardcopies
	of customer lists “confidential,” and restricting access to the customer list to designated and appropriate personnel,
	and the like. Associate further agrees, as an Associate, to use his best efforts and the utmost diligence to guard and protect
	the Company’s Trade Secrets and Confidential Information from disclosure to any competitor, customer or supplier of the Company
	or any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, unless such disclosure has been specifically authorized by the Company
	in writing.


	 


	(d)       Non-Competition.
	Associate acknowledges that the Company is engaged in the Company Business as defined herein. Associate further acknowledges that
	the Company Business is primarily concentrated in and focused in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma,
	Tennessee and Texas (hereinafter the “Territory”), and that Associate’s duties and responsibilities were not
	limited to any particular area within that region but will be within and throughout the entire Territory, and rendered in connection
	with Company Business. Associate further agrees and acknowledges that because of his association with the Company and his access
	to Trade Secrets and confidential, proprietary information of the Company which relate to the Company Business as herein defined,
	Associate’s competition with the Company as or with a direct competitor in the same line of business as the Company would
	damage and impair the business of the Company. Therefore, during the term of his employment and for a period of one (1) year from
	the conclusion of Associate’s employment with the Company for any reason, Associate shall not, for himself or on behalf of
	any other person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, business organization, entity or enterprise, perform duties which
	are substantially similar to the duties performed by Associate on behalf of Company within the Territory for any business engaged
	in the Company Business as defined herein.

	copyright, trade secret, confidential information, and other property rights, created or developed in whole or in part by Associate,
	relating to the Company Business whether prior to the date of this Agreement or in the future, either (i) while employed by the
	Company and that have been or will be paid for by the Company, or (ii) while employed by the Company (whether developed during
	working hours or not) and not otherwise the subject of a written agreement between the Company and Associate. All Work Product
	shall be considered work made for hire by Associate and owned by the Company. If any of the Work Product may not, by operation
	of law, be considered work made for hire by Associate for the Company, or if ownership of all rights, title, and interest of the
	intellectual property rights therein shall not otherwise vest exclusively in the Company, Associate hereby assigns to the Company,
	and upon the future creation thereof automatically assigns to the Company without further consideration, the ownership of all Work
	Product. The Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its own name patents, copyrights, registrations and any other protection
	available in the Work Product. Associate agrees to perform, during and after his employment, such further acts as may be necessary
	or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend the Company’s ownership of the Work Product as reasonably requested by the
	Company.

	files, reports, studies, manuals, compilations, drawings, blueprints, sketches, videos, memoranda, computer software and programs,
	data or any other information, including Trade Secrets and Confidential Information as set forth herein, (whether originals, copies
	or extracts, stored in any medium), whether prepared or developed by Associate or otherwise coming into Associate’s possession,
	whether maintained by Associate in the facilities of the Company, at Associate’s home, or at any other location, is, and
	shall remain, the exclusive property of the Company and shall be promptly delivered to the Company, with no copies or reproductions
	retained by Associate, in the event of Associate’s termination for any reason, or at any other time or times the Company

	attached hereto as

	.


	 


	(g)       Reasonable
	Restrictions. Associate agrees and acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary in
	order to protect the valuable proprietary assets, goodwill and business of the Company and that the restrictions will not prevent
	or unreasonably restrict his ability to earn a livelihood. Associate also agrees and acknowledges that if his employment with the
	Company ends for any reason, Associate will be able to earn a livelihood without violating the restrictions contained in this Agreement
	and that Associate’s ability to earn a livelihood without violating said restrictions is an important reason in Associate
	choosing to sign this Agreement.

	Remedies

	.
	The Associate expressly agrees that the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of Section 6 will be inadequate and that
	upon any such breach or threatened breach, the Company shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to injunctive relief in any court

	under the Company’s disability insurance policy shall be deducted from the amounts payable to the Associate hereunder. For
	the purposes of this Agreement, the Associate shall be deemed to be “disabled” when, by reason of any medically determinable
	physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a period of not less than
	twelve (12) consecutive months, he has received replacement income for a period of at least three (3) months under the Company’s

	any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for
	a period of not less than twelve (12) consecutive months. Any disability, as defined herein, shall not constitute “Cause”

	12.       

	Change

	a Double Trigger Event (as defined in Section 12(c) herein) occurs in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in Section

	to the Change in Control; (ii) all outstanding and unvested stock options previously granted to the Associate by the Parent Company
	shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions, unless otherwise prohibited
	by the Option Plan (or successor plan) or the stock option agreements between the Parent Company and the Associate with respect

	by the Parent Company shall immediately vest in full, without regard to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions,
	unless otherwise prohibited by the Incentive Plan (or successor plan) or the restricted stock agreements between the Parent Company
	and the Associate with respect to such restricted stock awards (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to as the “Change
	in Control Payments”).


	 









	10







	 



	 


	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
	Associate shall not be entitled to receive any of the payments or benefits described in Section 12 unless, not later than sixty
	(60) days after the termination date, the Associate has executed a release of claims against the Company and its affiliates (the
	“Release”), and the period during which the Release may be revoked has expired without the Associate having revoked
	the Release. None of the payments or benefits described in Section 12 shall be paid until the Release has been signed and become
	effective, and any payments, which would otherwise be payable during such sixty-day period prior to the date the Release becomes
	effective, shall be accumulated and paid to the Associate on the first payroll date following the date the Release becomes effective,
	without interest, or, if such sixty-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, the first payroll
	date during the second calendar year following the date the Release becomes effective, as described above.


	 


	(b)       For
	purposes of this Section 12, “Change in Control” of the Parent Company shall mean:


	 


	(i)       Change
	in Ownership. The acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
	of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) (a “Person”) of ownership of stock of the Parent Company that, together
	with stock held by such Person, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of
	the Parent Company. However, if any Person is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value of total voting power
	of the stock of the Parent Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same Person is not considered to cause a change
	in ownership of the Parent Company (or to cause a change in the effective control of the Parent Company). An increase in the percentage
	of stock owned by any one Person as a result of a transaction in which the Parent Company acquires its stock in exchange for property
	will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this paragraph. This paragraph applies only when there is a transfer
	of stock of the Parent Company (or issuance of stock of the Parent Company) and stock in the Parent Company remains outstanding
	after the transaction; or


	 


	(ii)       Change
	in Effective Control. (A) the acquisition by any Person during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition
	by such Person, of ownership of stock of the Parent Company possessing 35% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the
	Parent Company; or (B) the replacement of a majority of members of the Parent Company’s Board of Directors during any 12-month
	period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Parent Company’s Board
	of Directors prior to the date of the appointment or election.


	 


	A change in effective control also may
	occur in any transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the transaction has a “Change in Ownership”
	under paragraph (i) or “Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of the Company’s Assets” under paragraph
	(iii). If any one Person is considered to effectively control the Parent Company, the acquisition of additional control of the
	Parent Company by the same Person is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the Parent Company (or to cause
	a “Change in Ownership” of the Parent Company within the meaning of paragraph (i) above); or


	 









	11







	 



	 


	(iii)       Change
	in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets. The acquisition by any Person during the 12-month period ending on the date of
	the most recent acquisition by such Person, of assets from the Parent Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to
	or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Parent Company immediately prior to such acquisition(s).
	For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Parent Company, or the value of the assets being
	disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. No Change in Control shall be deemed to
	have occurred in the event of a transfer to a related person or as described in Code Section 409A.


	 


	The definition of Change in Control
	in this Subsection 12(b), and all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall be interpreted at all times in such a manner
	as to comply with Code Section 409A, meaning that no additional income tax is imposed on the Associate pursuant to Code Section
	409A(1)(a).


	 


	(c)       For
	purposes of this Section 12, a “Double Trigger Event” shall be deemed to occur if, within the period beginning six
	(6) months prior to a Change in Control and ending two (2) years following such Change in Control, (i) the Associate’s employment
	is involuntarily terminated by the Company or the Parent Company (or the surviving or acquiring entity, as the case may be), other
	than for Cause, or (ii) the Associate terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in Section 12(d) herein). If the termination
	of the Associate’s employment, as contemplated by this Section 12(c), occurs prior to the Change in Control, then the Associate
	shall be treated for purposes of this Section 12 as being employed on the date the Change in Control becomes effective and the
	Associate’s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to such termination shall be deemed in effect, for purposes of this Section
	12, immediately prior to the Change in Control. For purposes of this Section 12, the date of the Double Trigger Event shall be
	the later of the effective date of the Change in Control and the date of the Associate’s termination of employment as contemplated
	in this Section 12(c).


	 


	(d)       For
	purposes of this Section 12, “Good Reason” shall mean:


	 


	(i)        If
	the Associate is a party to an employment or service agreement with the Company, the Parent Company or an affiliate of the Company
	that supersedes and replaces, in whole or in part, any provisions of this Agreement and such agreement provides for a definition
	of Good Reason, the definition contained therein; or


	 


	(ii)       If
	no such agreement exists, the Associate’s resignation from the Company within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of
	any of the following events with respect to the Associate:


	 









	12







	 



	 


	(A)       Without
	the Associate’s express written consent, the significant reduction of the Associate’s duties, authority, responsibilities,
	or reporting relationships relative to the Associate’s duties, authority, responsibilities, or reporting relationships as
	in effect immediately prior to such reduction, or the assignment to the Associate of such reduced duties, authority, responsibilities,
	or reporting relationships, which reduction or assigned reduction remains in effect five (5) business days after written notice
	by the Associate to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Parent Company (or the surviving or acquiring
	entity, as the case may be) of such conditions; provided, however, that the mere occurrence of a Change in Control shall not, in
	and of itself, constitute a material adverse change in the Associate’s duties, authority, responsibilities or reporting relationships.


	 


	(B)       A
	material reduction by the Company or the Parent Company (or the surviving or acquiring entity, as the case may be) in the Base
	Salary, bonus structure or benefits of the Associate as in effect immediately prior to such reduction, with the result that the
	Associate’s overall benefits package is significantly reduced; or


	 


	(C)       The
	relocation of the Associate’s principal work location to a facility or a location more than fifty (50) miles from the Associate’s
	then present principal work location, without the Associate’s express written consent.


	 


	(e)       The
	Change in Control Payments shall be in addition to any other rights and benefits for which the Associate is eligible, either by
	way of contract or with respect to rights and benefits generally available to other executive officers or Associates of the Company.


	 


	13.       

	Definition
	of Termination of Employment.

	“Termination of Employment” as used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning
	as set out in, and shall occur on the date determined in accordance with, Section 1.409A-1(h) of the regulations promulgated under
	Code Section 409A.


	 


	14.       

	Specified
	Employee Delay

	. If the Associate is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code Section 409A, any benefits
	or payments (including installments and insurance premiums and contributions) which (a) constitute a “deferral of compensation”
	under Code Section 409A, (b) become payable as a result of the Associate’s termination of employment for reasons other than
	death, and (c) become due under this Agreement during the first six (6) months (or such longer period as required by Code Section
	409A) after termination of employment shall be delayed and all such delayed payments (or delayed installments, premiums or contributions)
	shall be paid to the Associate in full in the seventh (7

	th

	) month after the date of termination and all subsequent
	payments (or installments) shall be paid in accordance with their original payment schedule. To the extent that any insurance
	premiums or other benefit contributions constituting a “deferral of compensation” become subject to the above delay,
	the Associate shall be responsible for paying such amounts directly to the insurer or other third party and shall receive reimbursement
	from Company for such amounts in the seventh (7

	th

	) month as described above. This paragraph shall not apply to payments
	made as a result of a termination of employment that is the result of the Associate’s death.

	of “nonqualified deferred compensation” to be made under this Agreement by reason of a termination of employment shall
	only be made if such termination of employment constitutes a “separation from service” under Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Code
	Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses
	that may be incurred by the Associate on account of non-compliance with Code Section 409A. To the extent required by Code Section
	409A, each reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under this Agreement shall be provided in accordance with the following: (i)
	the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during each calendar year cannot affect the expenses
	eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (ii) any reimbursement of an eligible
	expense shall be paid to the Associate on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
	expense was incurred; and (iii) any right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation
	or exchange for another benefit.

	18.       

	Section
	280G

	.


	 


	(a)       In
	the event that the total amount of payments to be received by the Associate, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, that are
	contingent upon a change in ownership or control (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) would, but for this Section 18(a),
	be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “

	Excise Tax

	”), then the amount of payments
	to be received by the Associate pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise shall be reduced to the maximum amount that will cause
	the total amounts of the payments not to be subject to the Excise Tax, but only if the amount of such payments, after such reduction
	and after payment of all applicable taxes on the reduced amount, is equal to or greater than the amount of such payments the Associate
	would otherwise be entitled to retain without such reduction after the payment of all applicable taxes, including the Excise Tax.


	 


	(b)       The
	accounting firm engaged by the Company for general audit purposes (the “Audit Firm”) shall perform any calculations
	necessary in connection with this Section 18; provided that, if for any reason the Audit Firm is unable to, or declines to, perform
	such calculations, the Company shall engage such other accounting firm as the Audit Firm shall recommend in writing to the Company
	to perform such calculations (the Audit Firm or such other accounting firm, as applicable, being hereinafter referred to as the
	“Accounting Firm”).  The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such Accounting
	Firm required to be made hereunder. The Accounting Firm engaged to make the determinations under this Section 18 shall provide
	its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Associate and the Company within fifteen (15) calendar
	days after the date on which the Associate’s right to a payment contingent on a Change in Control is triggered (if requested
	at that time by Associate or the Company) or such other time as requested by the Associate or the Company.  If the Accounting
	Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to such payments, it shall furnish the Associate and the Company with
	an opinion reasonably acceptable to Associate that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such payments.  Any good
	faith determinations of the Accounting Firm made hereunder shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon Associate and the Company.
	If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting “parachute payments” is required by Section 18(a), the reduction
	shall occur in the following order unless the Associate elects in writing a different order (provided, however, that such election
	shall be subject to the Company’s approval if made on or after the date on which the event that triggers the payment occurs
	and to the extent that such election does not violate Code Section 409A): reduction of cash payments (in reverse order of the date
	on which such cash payments would otherwise be made with the cash payments that would otherwise be made last being reduced first);
	cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock awards; reduction of employee benefits.  In the event that accelerated vesting
	of stock awards is to be reduced, such accelerated vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the grant date of the Associate’s
	stock awards unless the Associate elects in writing a different order for cancellation.


	 









	15







	 



	 


	19.       

	Assignability

	. The Associate may
	not assign his interest in or delegate his duties under this Agreement. The rights and obligations of the Company hereunder may
	be assigned only by operation of law in connection with a merger in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or in connection
	with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company; and in the latter event, such assignment shall not relieve the
	Company of its obligations hereunder.


	 


	20.       

	Binding
	Effect

	. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns.


	 


	21.       

	Entire
	Agreement; Modification

	. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject
	matter hereof and may not be modified or amended in any way except in writing by the parties hereto. This Agreement supersedes
	and replaces any and all prior employment agreements between the Company and the Associate, all of which are hereby terminated
	and declared null and void; provided, however, this Agreement shall not affect, in any manner, previously awarded restricted stock
	or stock options, which awards shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such previous awards.


	 


	22.       

	Duration

	.
	Notwithstanding the termination of the Employment Term and of the Associate’s employment by the Company, this Agreement shall
	continue to bind the parties for so long as any obligations remain under this Agreement, and, in particular, the Associate shall
	continue to be bound by the terms of Section 6.


	 


	23.       

	Waiver

	.
	No waiver by the Company of any breach by the Associate of this Agreement shall be construed to be a waiver as to succeeding breaches.


	 









	16







	 



	 


	24.       

	Enforceability

	.
	The covenants and provisions contained herein are severable and are to be interpreted as such to the extent permitted by applicable
	law. The parties understand, acknowledge and agree that should any provision of this Agreement be declared or determined by any
	court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the validity of the remaining parts, terms or provisions
	of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby, and that the Agreement will be amended to delete or modify, as necessary, any
	invalid or unenforceable parts, terms or provisions to the extent necessary to allow for enforcement.




	 


	25.       

	Counterparts

	.
	This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute
	one and the same agreement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
