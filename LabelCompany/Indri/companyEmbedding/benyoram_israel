About This BookTable of Contents 

For twenty-five years after its establishment in 1948, Israel was considered an economic miracle, with one of the highest rates of growth in the world. During the 1970s, however, the country became notorious for its economic problems: growth nearly ceased, inflation accelerated, and indebtedness grew. Here is the only comprehensive, up-to-date analysis of this troubled economy. The product of a cooperative research effort, it contains contributions by seventeen top Israeli economists, many of whom have served as advisers to the Israeli government and thus are able to draw on first-hand knowledge of the country’s economic administration and policy making. Their interpretation makes use of original empirical data and emphasizes the unique political economy of the country and its institutional structure.
The book considers both microeconomic and macroeconomic issues, with sections devoted to growth and structural change, human resources, the public sector (including defense), the problems of an open economy, and the dynamics of inflation. It becomes clear that Israel’s current difficulties are rooted in its history and political culture. The authors’ prescription for a cure is rigorous: Israel’s administrators must be willing to alter their long-standing accommodating monetary policies, and the country must substantially change the organization of its major economic sectors in order to become more self-reliant.
The book will be invaluable to scholars, professional economists, bankers, journalists, policymakers, and specialists in foreign affairs. Some sections would be ideal for course use. The less technical chapters—such as the Introduction, which provides essential historical and political context—will be useful to all general readers who are interested in the challenges facing Israel today.

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…

Abstract:


 
The Entwined Growth of Population and Product, 1922 -1982 

Yoram Ben-Porath
Israel's Jewish population and economy are based on a hundred years of immigration. Immigration has shaped the rate of growth of the Jewish population and its demographic composition; it also created much of the socioeconomic diversity within the Jewish population. This chapter discusses aggregate-level interactions between Jewish immigration and economic growth both in the Jewish sector of Mandatory Palestine and in Israel.
Under the British mandate a Jewish economy existed alongside an Arab one. The Jewish population in 1919 was so small that it hardly constituted an economic entity. But the rapid growth of that population (485,000 immigrants) in 1919-1948 and a concurrent huge growth of product with its own institutional structure created a distinct Jewish economy, separate but not completely isolated from the Arab sector (Metzer, 1982). Since 1948 the Jewish economy and the economy of Israel have been synony- mous, with only a small Arab sector remaining integrated into the general economy. After the 1967 war, however, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip became part of the Israeli market, and the labor pool there both benefited from the higher wages in the Israeli market and acted as a buffer to domestic fluctuations. Both Szereszewski's (1968) estimates of product and capital for the years 1922-1948 and the estimates for the first years of statehood are necessarily rough, so that comparisons with the more recent period are difficult. The estimates for 1948-1950 are particularly rough and are not considered here. These are some of the factors that prevent treatment of the entire period 1919-1982 as a single block. How-

ever, because the Mandate period provides a useful perspective on the relationship between population and economic growth in the period of statehood, most of the discussion here will refer to both periods.1
Nahum Gross (1981) divided the Mandate period into two major sub- periods: 1918-1932 and 1933-1947. Each began with a very large wave of immigration. In 1919 the Jewish population of Palestine was 57,000; 95,600 immigrants arrived in 1920-1926, adding 9-15 percent to the population each year (28.3 percent in 1926 alone). In 1932 the Jewish population was 175,000; 147,000 immigrants arrived in 1933 -1935, adding 17-20 percent annually, and another 30,000 came in 1936 (Sicron, 1957). In the quarter-century before 1948 the Jewish population increased eight- fold, with the population more than doubling on average each decade, and reached approximately 650,000 by the end of the period. The total product of the Jewish economy in Palestine in the same years increased twenty-fivefold at an average annual rate of 13.7 percent. The total stock of capital increased fifteenfold (Szereszewski, 1968).
From mid-1948 to the end of 1951 687,000 immigrants arrived, averag- ing 19 percent of the general population annually (24 and 27 percent in 1948 and 1949 respectively); by the end of 1951 the Jewish population had more than doubled, to 1.4 million. In the next two decades it redou- bled, growing 47 and 35 percent respectively. The 1970s marked the end of an exceptionally high and sustained period of population growth, with an increase of 26 percent for the decade. Over the period 1948-1982 the Jewish population grew from 650,000 to 3.4 million. Immigration contributed 1,385,000 and natural increase 1,337,000.
From 1950 to 1982 total product increased elevenfold and capital stock sixteenfold. Product tripled in the first decade, doubled in the second. But from 1972 to 1982 total product increased only 37 percent. Most remarkable is the high growth rate of per capita income that tended to accompany the rapid increase of population-4.8 percent annually in the Mandate period, a similarly high rate in 1948-1951, and 5.2 percent in 1951-1972, in contrast to 0.8 percent in 1972-1982 (Table 1-1).
Figure 1-1 shows the correspondence between the ratio of immigrants to mean Jewish population and the growth rates of GNP. The correlation is 0.72 in both the Mandate and state periods; the correlation between immigration and per capita GNP is much lower. It is hard to detect consistent leads or lags in the earlier period. After 1948, however, cycles in immigration tend to follow cycles in GNP.
Figure 1-2 shows a remarkable correspondence between fluctuations in immigration and in the growth rate of capital stock before 1948 and
The idea to incorporate the Mandate period in this analysis came from Moshe Syrquin, who performs his own long-term analysis in Chapter 2.

after 1951; in the latter period the correspondence holds for both dwelling and nondwelling capital (not shown). In addition to three large swings in immigration and economic growth in the mid-192Os, the mid-193Os, and 1950, there are short-term cyclical comovements (a glaring exception is the period of the Arab boycott and disruptions in 1936-1939, followed by World War 11, when growth picked up while immigration declined). The short-term movements are more clearly discernible in the years after the last big swing.
Such aggregate relationships between immigration and economic growth have been studied for the United States. Jerome (1926) observed the responsiveness of migration to employment conditions. Kuznets and Rubin (1954) and Kuznets (1958) observed the relationships between long swings in the growth of product and immigration. For the period before World War I they found that "the long swings in net immigration tended to follow those in gross national product per worker and to pre- cede those in the constant dollar volume of residential construction" (1954, p. 32). Abramowitz (1961) explored what he dubbed "Kuznets cycles" and emphasized the roles of demand and intensity of factor utili- zation in bringing about an increase in population through migration and an increase in capital stock. Several studies discussed the response of immigration to inverse swings in economic growth in the United States and the European countries of origin. Easterlin (1968) has shown that the cessation of large immigration shifted the demographic response to fertility.

Population as an Engine of Growth
The record of long-term growth in total product and Jewish population in Palestine and Israel is truly exceptional by world standards (see Chap- ter 2). Also remarkable is the fact that in Israel such high rates of popula- tion increase were accompanied by a long-term increase in per capita income. In fifty-nine years of recorded growth, per capita income is reported to have declined in only twelve. The United States also experi- enced growth in per capita income during the periods of rapid population increase before World War I. There is no proof, however, that the growth in per capita income was caused by population growth, and the debate surrounding the favorable effects of population growth continues (see Simon, 1977).
Steady-state growth theory does not provide much useful guidance for understanding and interpreting the effect of population growth through immigration on the economy. Immigration affects the economy through the supply side, by expanding the supply of labor (and often of capital); it generates surges in demand that directly affect the level of activity and may induce further changes in factor supplies.
Obviously the rate of immigration-which dictated the rate of popula- tion increase-was a dominant factor in changing Israel's working-age population and the labor supply. However, as the composition of immi- grants by country of origin and age has changed, so too has the translation of immigration into working-age population. Most of the pre-1948 immi- grants were of or near working age (20-64) and in this respect resembled European migrants to other countries. The surge of immigrants in 1948- 1951 included a high proportion of families with many children. Conse- quently, between 1950 and 1965 the working-age population grew at significantly lower rates than the total population (Table 1-2). During that period net immigration directly contributed between one-half and two-thirds to the growth of the adult population. Immigrant children growing to adulthood also made a significant net contribution to the adult population: over two-thirds, in contrast to less than one-third by the Israeli-born. From 1965 on, however, the Israeli-born contributed a rapidly growing share to the growth of the adult population; even though direct immigration in the early 1970s was still significant, the foreign- born made a net negative contribution to the adult population in that decade. In the growth of the labor force the foreign-born contributed three-quarters in 1955-1961, about half in 1961 -1970 and only 14 percent in 1970-1980 (Ben-Porath, 1983).
There have also been sharp differences in the skill levels of immigrants. The pre-1948, 84 percent European, immigrants were among the most highly educated population in the world (Easterlin, 1961a). The immi- grants arriving in 1948-1960 had a much lower level of schooling: ac- cording to one estimate the per capita human capital of immigrants (age 30+) in those years was 57.1 percent that of the pre-1948 population (76 percent for the European-born and 32 percent for immigrants from Asia and Africa; see Baruh, 1965). This situation changed after the first decade: the immigrants of the 1960s had slightly more schooling than the 1960 host population; those of the 1970s had a significantly higher level of schooling than the host population2 (83 percent of those arriving in 1969-
1982 came from Europe and America, mostly from the USSR, compared with 43 percent in 1948-1968 and 84 percent in 1919-1948; see CBS, 1982).
Immigration initially entails the obsolescence of skills acquired in the country of origin. The process of economic absorption involves learning the host country's language, other specific skills of living, and on-the- job acquisition of skills. Mass immigration was associated with a decline not only in level of education but also in the level of country-specific skills. In Israel this phenomenon is expressed in dramatic occupational changes and upward occupational mobility (Ben-Porath, 1973a). It is
Documented in Amir (1985).

reflected also in the cross-section differentials in earnings associated with length of residence (Hanoch, 1961; Levy, 1968; Amir, 1981, 1984). The average length of stay in Israel increased following mass immigration. Kuznets (1973) estimated that this factor contributed approximately 1.5 percent to growth in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the effect of length of stay in Israel on earnings diminishes over time as the proportion of new immigrants declines, this factor lost its relevance in the 1970s.
The response of capital depends on the supply of resources available for capital formation (that is, capital imports and domestic savings) and on the demand for investment. Immigration creates direct demand for housing and exerts an indirect effect through consumption-derived de- mand for producer capital. In addition, the increased supply of labor raises the demand for capital. In the Mandate period, private capital im- ports were substantial and were directly related to immigration-the correlation between private capital imports and immigration for 1924-
1939 is 0.95. There is also some evidence that institutional capital imports were related to population growth (Gross and Metzer, 1977). The post- 1948 immigration brought insignificant private capital imports. Capital imports were mostly in the hands of the public sector, driven by a demand created by immigration and other factors. No analysis is available on the effect of immigrants on domestic savings. Obviously, part (probably a substantial one) of the negative public-sector savings can be attributed to the gap between the demand for services created by immigrants and their initially low contribution to the tax base.
An important element in the effect of population on economic growth is based on increasing returns to scale. Despite rapid growth in the Man- date period, the Jewish population was still small in 1948. The Mandate authorities restricted immigration on the grounds of "limited absorptive capacity," that is, strongly decreasing returns to scale in the short run. In the long run, however, there were increasing returns to scale. The establishment of Israel in the midst of a war dramatized the issue of minimum viable population size, not only in terms of physical survival but also in economic terms. Empirically, this phenomenon raises a related question: is the rate of technical change independent of the rate and nature of population growth? As shown by Metzer (1982), the period of rapid growth in per capita income is associated not only with an increase in capital per capita but also with an increase in total factor productivity. (He points to a correlation of 0.5 between total hours of work and total factor productivity.)
How did immigration affect public and private consumption? The pub- lic sector played an inordinately large role in the economy, in part because of the need to provide immigrants with employment, shelter, and services, followed by a more gradual social and economic absorption effort. The public sector's continued involvement in improving housing and provid- ing employment, health services, and education had a lasting effect on its size and function, extending well beyond the period of mass immigration.'
On the aggregate level there is no systematic statistical relationship between civilian public consumption and population growth for the post- 1948 period. In the Mandate period cyclical movements were transmitted from population to product, unmitigated by active government macroeco- nomic policy. Indeed, because the role of government has been much more dominant since 1948 than in the Mandate period, macroeconomic fluctuations have been affected by a variety of other considerations. The creation of a large public sector was partly induced by immigration in a variety of ways: through the need to provide the services and means of absorption, the desire to control the process (such as the control of initial geographic allocation), and the desire to provide employment directly in hard times to groups experiencing labor-market difficulties. But immigra- tion cannot explain the significant growth in public-sector employment in the 1970s (see Chapter 5).
In the period 1951-1964 private per capita consumption doubled. This rapid rise in the standard of living occurred while a large fraction of resources was devoted to capital formation and a rising share was devoted to defense-obviously at the expense of the foreign account. Although economists (such as Patinkin, 1960) protested at the time, the govern- ment's strategy may have been considered necessary to promote social cohesion, discourage emigration, and attract further immigration; other- wise growth itself might have been jeopardized. The growth in per capita consumption continued in the period of slower population growth, 1964-
1972. What requires an explanation is the fact that during the stagnant years, 1972-1982, per capita consumption continued to increase (more than one-third over the decade) while product per capita rose no more than 8 percent.
The natural short-term effect of immigration on total product is quite different: it is reasonable to expect immigration to push up aggregate demand initially and then to raise labor supply, creating cycles (see Mer- hav, 1963).
It is no simple matter to find statistical support for the effects of popula- tion growth and to differentiate them from short-term relationships. As mentioned earlier, there were three long swings in immigration. A major event such as mass immigration must have left a lasting impression on economic life. Yet for this very reason it cannot be captured by a regres- sion. Similarly, it is hard to isolate the effect of immigration on the extensive role of government in the public sector. The series are too short

and the number of "major events" too small for statistical verification of the long-term hypotheses, and the statistical relationships are probably dominated by short-term relationships.
I first examine a series of regressions in which the economic variables are assumed to depend on the population variables, ignoring the possibil- ity of reverse causality (Table 1-3). The first strong relationship emerges from an examination of capital accumulation: the growth rate of capital stock responds positively to the following alternative population vari- ables: the ratio of immigrants to the population, the ratio of net migration to population, and the rate of population increase. The coefficients of the population variables are higher in the statehood period than in the Man- date period. I have also included lagged growth of GNP in these equations in order to capture an accelerator mechanism. It is interesting to see whether this last relationship is solely a reflection of "population-related capital," mostly residential building. In the study of long swings in the United States, Kuznets (1958) found that investment in dwellings and railroads swung in conformity with population while other investment had an inverted swing. A $unction estimated for investment in dwellings showed a reaction to the growth of population, to per capita income, and

to the share of population age 20-29. But in Israel also the growth of nondwelling capital stock responds to the population variables (Ta- ble 1-3).
The growth rate of total GNP depends positively on the current rate of immigration (immigrants divided by population) and inversely on the lagged rate of immigration (Table 1-4). The same is true when the growth rate of population replaces immigration in the regressions. The positive current coefficient is much higher than the lagged negative effect, and higher for 1951-1982 than for the Mandate period. Correspondingly, population growth reduced current unemployment but raised it with a lag in 1921-1947.~
Per capita income also responds positively to the current rate of immi- gration and adversely to the lagged rate (Table 1-4, columns 3 and 4). The sum of coefficients is negative for 1923-1947, indicating a net de- pressive effect, while for 1951-1982 the sum is positive, indicating a growth-enhancing effect of immigration.
The regression of the unemployment rate on lagged unemployment and the growth rate of population for 1924-1947 is the following:
where U is the rate of unemployment and RP is the growth rate of the Jewish population.
Was the Size of the Population Dependent on the Economy?
This direction of causality also has both long- and short-term aspects. Immigration, emigration, and the rate of natural increase are responsive to income and employment opportunities. Short-term fluctuations in these variables also reflect the adjustment of the timing of migration or fertility to economic fluctuations. As already mentioned, there Ts a long tradition of studies on the cyclical responsiveness of immigration (such as Jerome, 1926). In studies of long swings in immigration (and fertility) Kuznets (1958), Abramowitz ( 1961), and Easterlin ( 1961 b) all emphasize the dominant role of demand conditions in the United States in initiating waves of immigration. This is probably not the case in Israel. The immi- gration waves before 1948 were not "caused" by economic fluctuations
-
in Palestine. Apparently exogenous shocks in the countries of origin, including economic fluctuations there, constituted dominant "push" fac- tors. This does not, however, rule out the possibility that rising unem- ployment, following an initial boom, checked further immigration and diverted it elsewhere. There is also evidence that the immigration policy of the Zionist movement was sensitive to the conditions of employment.
The mass immigration of 1948-1951 was certainly independent of the domestic economic scene in Israel. For most of these displaced Jews from Europe and Jewish communities from Arab countries, Israel was the only option. Economic conditions in Israel affected immigration in the early years of statehood largely through the immigration policies of the govern- ment and the Jewish Agency. Thus the lull in immigration after 1951 reflected a reaction to the economic hardships associated with immigra- tion. In later years immigration of entire communities diminished and became dependent on political turning points in various Eastern European and Latin American countries. The last and most significant was the partial relaxation of Soviet emigration restrictions in 1970. And it is quite possible that the declining share of those arriving in Israel out of those leaving the Soviet Union reflects a response to economic conditions in Israel. As immigration declined in volume, it grew more and more depen- dent on individual choice and, as such, on economic conditions. Another implication of the decline in immigration is that the relative weight of emigration in the fluctuations of net migration (which is the difference between immigration and emigration) increased. Lamdany (1982) has shown that emigration from Israel responds to economic fluctuations, and in this respect the experience of the 1965-1967 recession influences current policy.
Table 1-5 shows that in 1954-1982 the rates of immigration, net migra-
tion, and population growth respond weakly to current, and significantly
to (three-year) lagged, rates of increase in per capita consumption. A
similar relationship holds for per capita GNP. For 1923-1947 the relation

Figure 1-3. Growth rates of per capita GNP and total fertility, 1951-1982
is strong with current and one-period lagged variables (similar results are reported by Ablin, 1979a). There is also evidence that the birth rate is responsive to economic fluctuations (Ben-Porath, 1973b). Data for the longer period, 1951-1982, seem to suggest that after 1973 the simple associations no longer hold (Figure 1-3 ).


Causality Tests
Causality between population and product runs both ways. The only empirical grip available is the sequence in which the variations occur. According to the procedure suggested by Granger (1969), x "causes" y if, in a regression of y on both x lagged and y lagged, there is a significant reduction in residual variance compared with a regression of y on lagged y alone; that is, x is said to "cause" y if lagged x has an independent effect on current y after y is purged of all its autocorrelation.
The causality tests were run with lags for each variable. The period 1948-1950 is generally excluded from the analysis where GNP figures are concerned because the linkage among the different series of estimates for the period is dubious. Table 1-6 shows the main results of the causality tests. There is strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that in the Mandate period immigration "caused" economic growth. On the other hand, most of the evidence on causality from the economic indicators to population is for the post-1951 period: the growth rates of per capita

There is two-way causality between the unemployment rate and the growth rate of population in 1926-1948; that is, unemployment is the only economic variable that also affects immigration in this period. A marginally significant relationship in both directions is also observed between the growth rate of per capita income and the ratio of immigrants to population in 1954-1982, but vanishes for 1951-1982. One-way causality is indicated from population or immigration to the growth in capital stock-it is very clear in the Mandate period, and marginally significant in the statehood period. The test certainly confirms the visual impression pined from Figure 1-2, that immigration leads capital.


Conclusion
This brief study of the two-way relationship between population and growth found stronger evidence for causality from immigration to eco- nomic growth in the Mandate period. For the whole period 1922-1982, it is very clear that immigration pushed the rate of increase of capital stock. For the period from 1954 on, immigration responded to the growth rate of per capita income or consumption. The graphs show both strong correspondence with and exceptions to the comovements of population and product (such as the large growth in product and the downturn in immigration during World War 11). There were swings associated with three large waves of immigration (two in the Mandate period and the mass immigration in the early years of statehood). Each provided a push to economic growth that affected the economy for many years. The drive provided by these waves of immigrants seems to have lost momentum sometime in the mid-1960s. Further exogenous waves of equal magnitude failed to emerge. In addition to the swings, there were short-term varia- tions. It is quite possible that the two types of fluctuations are responsible for the difference in the dominant direction of causality between the periods: the swings largely represent the effect of population on the econ- omy and they dominate the Mandate period and the early state period. The response of immigration to per capita income was more closely related to short-term variations. Whereas in the early period this relation- ship was swamped and dominated by the (largely exogenous) long swings, the latter period allowed this dependence of immigration on the economy to emerge. But there may be another substantive reason for the difference between the periods: the Israeli government's large role in the economy may have eliminated or suppressed the short-term effects of population movements on the economy.
The evidence strongly supports the notion that the economic stagnation of the past decade had a demographic component. After half a century of extraordinarily rapid growth in population, total product, and per capita product, the slowdown in population growth and the stagnation in productivity growth (despite continued growth in the capital stock) must have reinforced one another. Although there are important autono- mous reasons for both-the depletion of sources of immigration, the energy crises, and decade-long worldwide economic stagflation-the response of population to the economic loss of momentum may have aggra- vated the situation.
