In pre-medieval times, the Germans used only one name, but later they were forced by a growing population to adopt hereditary surnames; so as to remain distinct from the many others of the same first name.  Local names were often chosen. They originally indicated land ownership, and frequently carried the prefix von, meaning "of" or "from," which is often taken as an indication of aristocratic lineage. Lindner was a name for some one lived beside a grove of lime trees. The family name Lindner is derived from the German word linde, which means lime tree. The original bearer was named for his proximity to a hill crowned by lime trees.Lindner Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Lindner was first found in the Lower Rhine, where this family became a prominent contributor to the development of the district from ancient times. Chronicles first mention Henczel unter der lynden of Freiberg (Saxony) in 1383, Hannus von der Linde in 1440, Jacob Lindner of Tirol in 1348, Johann van Lynder of the lower Rhine in 1528, and Hermann Lindeman of Hanover in 1335. Always prominent in social affairs, the name became an integral part of that turbulent region as they emerged to form alliances with other families within the  feudal system.Lindner Spelling VariationsLindner Spelling VariationsMany cultural groups lived in the German states in medieval times. Each had its own dialect and traditions, and unique variations of popular names. Low German, which is similar to contemporary Dutch, was spoken in  Westphalia. German names are characterized by additions such as regional suffixes and phrases that tell something about the origin or background of its original bearer. Further contributing to the variation in German names was the fact that there were no spelling rules in medieval times: scribes recorded names according to their sound. The recorded  spelling variations of Lindner include Linde, Linden Linder, Lindner, Lindener and others.Lindner Early HistoryLindner Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Lindner research.

They had many various reasons for making the choice: to escape poverty and persecution, for adventure, and for the opportunity to own their own land.  Ellis Island, one of the main American immigration centers, saw many settlers as they moved on to the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, California, and New York. In Canada, they found homes in Ontario, and on the great plains of the Midwestern provinces.

In pre-medieval times, the Germans used only one name, but later they were forced by a growing population to adopt hereditary surnames; so as to remain distinct from the many others of the same first name.  Local names were often chosen. They originally indicated land ownership, and frequently carried the prefix von, meaning "of" or "from," which is often taken as an indication of aristocratic lineage. Lindner was a name for some one lived beside a grove of lime trees. The family name Lindner is derived from the German word linde, which means lime tree. The original bearer was named for his proximity to a hill crowned by lime trees.Lindner Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Lindner was first found in the Lower Rhine, where this family became a prominent contributor to the development of the district from ancient times. Chronicles first mention Henczel unter der lynden of Freiberg (Saxony) in 1383, Hannus von der Linde in 1440, Jacob Lindner of Tirol in 1348, Johann van Lynder of the lower Rhine in 1528, and Hermann Lindeman of Hanover in 1335. Always prominent in social affairs, the name became an integral part of that turbulent region as they emerged to form alliances with other families within the  feudal system.Lindner Spelling VariationsLindner Spelling VariationsMany cultural groups lived in the German states in medieval times. Each had its own dialect and traditions, and unique variations of popular names. Low German, which is similar to contemporary Dutch, was spoken in  Westphalia. German names are characterized by additions such as regional suffixes and phrases that tell something about the origin or background of its original bearer. Further contributing to the variation in German names was the fact that there were no spelling rules in medieval times: scribes recorded names according to their sound. The recorded  spelling variations of Lindner include Linde, Linden Linder, Lindner, Lindener and others.Lindner Early HistoryLindner Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Lindner research.

They had many various reasons for making the choice: to escape poverty and persecution, for adventure, and for the opportunity to own their own land.  Ellis Island, one of the main American immigration centers, saw many settlers as they moved on to the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, California, and New York. In Canada, they found homes in Ontario, and on the great plains of the Midwestern provinces.
