Please see the fund prospectuses for more information about subaccount underlying portfolios, including portfolio operating expenses for the year ended December 31, The disclosure about the Ameritas company's businesses is updated and revised to read as follows: The Ameritas companies are a diversified family of financial services businesses offering life insurance and annuities, group dental, vision and hearing care insurance, retirement plans and 401(k) plans as well as mutual funds and other investments, financial planning, and public financing. FA2 4. The Legal Proceedings section in your prospectus is deleted and replaced with the following: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We and our subsidiaries, like other life insurance companies, are subject to regulatory and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of the proceedings we are involved in assert claims for substantial amounts. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of any pending or future case, legal proceeding or regulatory action, we do not expect the ultimate result of any of these actions to result in a material adverse effect on the Separate Account, our ability to meet our obligations under the Policies, or AIC's ability to perform its obligations. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on any or all of the above. 5. As indicated in prior disclosures and communications, any allocations made to closed investment options will be allocated according to the allocation instructions we have for your policy, after omitting allocation instructions relating to the closed investment option(s). All other provisions of your Policy remain as stated in your Policy and prospectus, as previously supplemented.

II, Overture Annuity III-Plus, Overture Acclaim! and Overture Accent! Prospectuses Dated May 1, 2012 Supplement Dated August 16, 2013 This supplement describes changes to the variable investment options available under your Policy. You should read this information carefully and retain this supplement for future reference together with the Prospectus for your Policy. [All capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as those included in the Prospectus.] New Variable Investment Option 1. The list of variable investment options on page 1 of Annuity III-Plus, Overture Accent!, and Overture Acclaim! is revised to include the following: * FIDELITY VIP Initial Class Money Market * Short cites are used in this list. The Separate Account Variable Investment Options section of the prospectus uses complete fund and portfolio names. 2. The table of Separate Account Variable Investment Options is revised to include the following: FUND NAME INVESTMENT ADVISER Portfolio Name Subadviser(s) Portfolio Type / Summary of Investment Objective Fidelity Variable Insurance Products Fidelity Management & Research Company Money Market 1,2 Current income. Subadvisers: (1) Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. and (2) other investment advisers serve as sub-advisers for the fund. Portfolio Substitution 3. We have filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") seeking an order approving the substitution of shares of the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial Class for shares of the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio. The effect of the substitution would permit us to replace the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio ("Existing Fund") with the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio ("Replacement Fund") as an investment option under the Policies. The Existing Fund and Replacement Fund are described in their respective summary prospectuses, which are available at no charge by contacting Customer Service at , or by logging into your account on the internet service center at AmeritasNY.com. Until the date of the substitution, Policy value currently allocated to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio may remain invested in the corresponding Subaccount, and transfers of Policy value into and out of that Subaccount will be allowed. Any allocation to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio pursuant to an asset allocation model will continue according to the model until the date of any substitution unless we receive different allocation instructions from you. We anticipate the substitution will occur on or around November 15, From the date of this supplement to the date of the substitution, if you have allocations to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio Subaccount, you may transfer such allocations to any other available Subaccount without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see FA725 7/135 Disruptive Trading Procedures in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer counting toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. If carried out, the proposed substitution would result in any Policy value you have allocated to the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund being, in effect, transferred at relative net asset value to a Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund. We will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution. There would be no tax consequences resulting from this exchange. After the substitution, the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund will no longer be available for investment under the Policy. Once the substitution occurs, unless you instruct us otherwise, any existing or future instruction that designates the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund will be deemed to be an instruction for the Subaccount funded by the Replacement Fund. This includes, but is not limited to, instructions for purchase payments, partial withdrawals, and transfer instructions (including instructions under any automatic or systematic transfer option). All references in your prospectus to the Existing Fund will be replaced with a reference to the Replacement Fund. From the date of the substitution, until at least thirty (30) days after the substitution, you are permitted to transfer Policy value out of the Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund to one or more other Subaccounts or the fixed account (if available) within the Policy without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see Disruptive Trading Procedures in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer being treated as one of a limited number of free transfers allowed under your Policy. If you would like to make a transfer of Policy value, please contact Customer Service at , or log into your account on the internet service center at AmeritasNY.com. Information about the Replacement Fund, its investment policy, risks, fees and expenses and other aspects of its operations, can be found in its prospectus, which you should read carefully. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY NEW FUND WILL ACHIEVE ITS STATED OBJECTIVE. If you have any questions about this proposed substitution, please contact a Customer Service representative at All other provisions of your Policy remain as stated in your Policy and prospectus, as previously supplemented.

It is similar to a share of a mutual fund. The Policy describes how Accumulation Units are calculated. Annuitant is the person on whose life annuity payments involving life contingencies are based and who receives Policy annuity payments. Annuity Date is the date annuity income payouts are scheduled to begin. This date is identified on the Policy Schedule page of your Policy. You may change this date, as permitted by the Policy and described in this prospectus. Beneficiary(ies) Owner's Beneficiary(ies) is the person(s) or legal entity who becomes the Policy Owner upon the Owner's death and who receives the death benefit payable upon the Owner's death prior to the Annuity Date. If none is named, those benefits are paid to the Owner's estate. Annuitant's Beneficiary(ies) is the person(s) or legal entity who receives the death benefit payable upon the Annuitant's death. If either an Owner or Annuitant's Beneficiary is named in the application, but not both, we presume you intend that person(s) or entity to serve both roles. Business Day is each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Cash Surrender Value is the Policy value less Policy fee, outstanding loans, and any premium tax charge not previously deducted. Owner, you, your is you -- the person(s) or legal entity who may exercise all rights and privileges under the Policy.

The investment options are described on this prospectus' cover and the INVESTMENT OPTIONS section. The Policy is a deferred annuity: it has an accumulation (or deferral) phase and an annuity income phase. Accumulation Phase. During the accumulation phase, any earnings that you leave in the Policy are not taxed. During this phase you can invest additional money into the Policy, transfer amounts among the investment options, and withdraw some or all of the value of your Policy. Some restrictions may apply to transfers (especially to transfers into and out of the Fixed Account). Withdrawals may be subject to income tax and a penalty tax. Annuity Income Phase. The accumulation phase ends and the annuity income phase begins on a date you select or the later of the fifth Policy Anniversary or Anniversary nearest the Annuitant's 85 th birthday (but in no case later than the Annuitant's 90 th birthday). During the annuity income phase, we will make periodic payments to the Annuitant, unless you specify otherwise. You can select payments that are guaranteed to last for the Annuitant's entire life or for some other period. Some or all of each payment will be taxable. POLICY OPERATION AND FEATURES Premiums. Minimum initial premium: $25,000. Minimum additional premium: $1,000, or $50 per month if through electronic funds transfer. No additional premiums will be accepted after the earlier of the Annuity Date or the Annuitant's 85 th birthday without our approval. Investment Options. Variable investment option allocations are invested in Subaccounts of the Separate Account, which in turn invest in corresponding underlying portfolios. Fixed Account allocations are invested in our general account and we guarantee a fixed rate of interest. You may transfer among investments, subject to limits. Dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing and earnings sweep systematic investment programs are available. Deductions from Assets. (See CHARGES on next pages.) Withdrawals. There are no Policy withdrawal charges applied to withdrawals. Each withdrawal must be at least $250. Annuity Income. Several fixed annuity income options are available. Death Benefit. A standard death benefit is paid upon the death of the Annuitant unless the guaranteed minimum death benefit is payable. Optional Features. Optional features available are listed in this prospectus' IMPORTANT POLICY PROVISIONS section. Most can only be elected at Policy issue and only if you and the Annuitant are then not older than age 70. TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS The Policy can be used to fund a tax-qualified plan such as an IRA or Roth IRA (including for rollovers from tax-sheltered annuities), SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA, etc. This prospectus generally addresses the terms that affect a non-tax-qualified annuity.

Information about fees and expenses for each current and closed portfolio is contained in the prospectus for that portfolio14 EXAMPLES OF EXPENSES The Examples below are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Policy with the cost of investing in other variable annuity policies. These costs include Policy owner transaction expenses, contract charges, separate account annual expenses, and Subaccount underlying portfolio fees and expenses. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Policy for the time periods indicated. The Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and assume the underlying portfolio and Policy fees and expenses indicated. The example amounts are illustrative only, and should not be considered a representation of past or future expenses. Your actual expenses may be higher or lower than those shown in the chart. Please note that although the examples assume $10,000 premium to aid comparisons, our minimum premium for this policy is $25,000. Surrender Policy at the end of the time period. ($) Annuitize Policy at the end of the time period. ($) Policy is neither surrendered nor annuitized.

This example assumes maximum charges of 1.40% for Separate Account annual expenses, a $40 guaranteed maximum Policy fee (although our current base Policy fee is $36), 0.55% of other Policy value annual expenses for the periodic step-up guaranteed minimum death benefit option, plus the maximum fees and expenses before any waivers or reductions of any of the portfolio companies (1.38%). (2) Minimum Policy Expense Charges. This example assumes current charges of 1.40% for Separate Account annual expenses, a $36 current Policy fee, plus the minimum fees and expenses after any waivers or reductions of any of the portfolio companies (0.40%). FINANCIAL INFORMATION Accumulation Unit Values We provide Accumulation Unit value history for each of the Separate Account variable investment options in Appendix A. Financial Statements Financial statements of the Subaccounts of the Separate Account and our company are included in the Statement of Additional Information. To learn how to get a copy, see the front or back page of this prospectus. CHARGES EXPLAINED ( = Base Policy Fee; = Optional Rider Fee) The following adds to information provided in the CHARGES section. Please review both prospectus sections for information on charges. WITHDRAWAL CHARGE NONE MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE We impose a daily fee to compensate us for the mortality and expense risks we have under the Policy. This fee is equal to an annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Separate Account. This fee is reflected in the Accumulation Unit values for each Subaccount. Our mortality risk arises from our obligation to make annuity payments and to pay death benefits prior to the Annuity Date. The mortality risk we assume is that annuitants will live longer than we project, so our cost in making annuity payments will be higher than projected. However, an Annuitant's own longevity, or improvement in general life expectancy, will not affect the periodic annuity payments we pay under your Policy. Another mortality risk we assume is that at your death the death benefit we pay will be greater than the Policy value. Our expense risk is that our costs to administer your Policy will exceed the amount we collect through administrative charges. If the mortality and expense risk charge does not cover our costs, we bear the loss, not you. If the charge exceeds our costs, the excess is our profit. If the withdrawal charge does not cover our Policy distribution costs, the deficiency is met from our general account assets, which may include amounts, if any, derived from this mortality and expense risk charge15 ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES Administrative fees help us cover our cost to administer your Policy. Administrative Expense Fee This fee is equal to an annual rate of 0.15% of the value of the net assets in the Separate Account. This fee is reflected in the Accumulation Unit values for each Subaccount. Annual Policy Fee Currently $36. We reserve the right to charge an annual Policy fee not to exceed $40. Any Policy Fee is deducted from your Policy value on the last Business Day of each Policy Year and upon a complete surrender. This fee is levied by canceling Accumulation Units and making a deduction from the Fixed Account. It is deducted from each Subaccount and the Fixed Account in the same proportion that the value in each Subaccount and the Fixed Account bears to the total Policy value. However, the Fixed Account share of this fee will never exceed $30 per year. We currently waive any Policy Fee if the Policy value is at least $50,000. TRANSFER FEE The first 15 transfers per Policy Year from Subaccounts or the Fixed Account are free. A transfer fee of $10 may be imposed for any transfer in excess of 15 per Policy Year. The transfer fee is deducted pro rata from each Subaccount (and, if applicable, the Fixed Account) in which the Owner is invested. TAX CHARGES New York currently does not level any premium tax on annuity policies. No charges are currently made for taxes other than premium taxes. We reserve the right to levy charges in the future for taxes or other costs resulting from taxes that we determine are properly attributable to the Separate Account. FEES CHARGED BY THE PORTFOLIOS Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio has investment advisory fees and expenses. They are described in more detail in each fund's prospectus. A portfolio's fees and expenses are not deducted from your Policy value. Instead, they are reflected in the daily value of portfolio shares which, in turn, will affect the daily Accumulation Unit value of the Subaccounts. These fees and expenses help to pay the portfolio's investment advisory and operating expenses. OPTIONAL FEATURES' CHARGES The optional feature is principally described in the prospectus section noted below: Optional Feature Optional Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit features Prospectus Section Where It Is Covered POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS: Death Benefits Charges for the optional feature are shown in this prospectus' CHARGES section. WAIVER OF CERTAIN CHARGES When the Policy is sold in a manner that results in savings of sales or administrative expenses, we reserve the right to waive all or part of any fee we charge under the Policy (excluding fees charged by the portfolios). Factors we consider include one or more of the following: size and type of group to whom the Policy is issued; amount of expected premiums; relationship with us (employee of us or an affiliated company, receiving distributions or making transfers from other policies we or one of our affiliates issue or transferring amounts held under qualified retirement plans we or one of our affiliates sponsor); type and frequency of administrative and sales services provided; or level of annual maintenance fee and withdrawal charges. In an exchange of another policy we or an affiliated company issued and where the withdrawal charge has been waived, the withdrawal charge for this Policy may be determined based on the dates premiums were received in the prior policy. Any fee waiver will not be discriminatory and will be done according to our rules in effect at the time the Policy is issued. We reserve the right to change these rules. The right to waive any fees may be subject to state approval16 INVESTMENT OPTIONS We recognize you have very personal goals and investment strategies. The Policy allows you to choose from a wide array of investment options - each chosen for its potential to meet specific investment objectives. You may allocate all or a part of your premiums among the Separate Account variable investment options or the Fixed Account fixed interest rate option. Allocations must be in whole percentages and total 100%. The variable investment options, which invest in underlying portfolios, are listed and described this section of the prospectus. SEPARATE ACCOUNT VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS The Separate Account provides you with variable investment options in the form of underlying portfolio investments. Each underlying portfolio is an open-end investment management company. When you allocate investments to an underlying portfolio, those investments are placed in a Subaccount of the Separate Account corresponding to that portfolio, and the Subaccount in turn invests in the portfolio. The Policy value of your Policy depends directly on the investment performance of the portfolios that you select. The Separate Account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust. The value of your Policy will increase or decrease based on the investment performance of the variable investment options you choose. The investment results of each variable investment option are likely to differ significantly, and vary over time. They do not earn a fixed interest rate. Please consider carefully, and on a continuing basis, which investment options best suit your long-term investment objectives and risk tolerance. The underlying portfolios in the Separate Account are NOT publicly traded mutual funds, and are NOT the same as other publicly traded mutual funds with very similar names. They are only available as separate account investment options in life insurance or variable annuity policies issued by insurance companies, or through participation in certain qualified pension or retirement plans. Even if the investment options and policies of some underlying portfolios available under the Policy may be very similar to the investment objectives and policies of publicly traded mutual funds that may be managed by the same investment adviser, the investment performance and results of the portfolios available under the Policy may vary significantly from the investment results of such other publicly traded mutual funds. You should read the prospectuses for the underlying portfolios together with this prospectus for more information. However, the SEC does not supervise the management or the investment practices or policies of the Separate Account or Ameritas Life of NY. The Separate Account was established as a separate investment account of First Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York under New York law on March 21, Effective October 1, 2011 First Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York changed its name to Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York. The name of the Separate Account was changed from "First Ameritas Variable Annuity Separate Account" to "Ameritas Life of NY Separate Account VA" by action of the Board of Directors of Ameritas Life of NY on March 1, Under New York law, we own the Separate Account assets, but they are held separately from our other assets and are not charged with any liability or credited with any gain of business unrelated to the Separate Account. Any and all distributions made by the underlying portfolios, with respect to the shares held by the Separate Account, will be reinvested in additional shares at net asset value. We are responsible to you for meeting the obligations of the Policy, but we do not guarantee the investment performance of any of the variable investment options' underlying portfolios. We do not make any representations about their future performance. You bear the risk that the variable investment options you select may fail to meet their objectives, that they could go down in value, and that you could lose principal. Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio operates as a separate variable investment option, and the income or loss of one generally has no effect on the investment performance of any other. Complete descriptions of each portfolio's investment objectives and restrictions and other material information related to an investment in the variable investment option are contained in the prospectuses for each of the underlying portfolios which accompany this prospectus17 This information is just a summary for each underlying portfolio. You should read the prospectus for an underlying portfolio for more information about that portfolio, including detailed information about the portfolio s fees and expenses, investment strategy and investment objectives, restrictions, and potential risks. To get a copy of any portfolio prospectus, contact your representative or us as shown on the Table of Contents page or the last page of this prospectus. The Subaccount underlying portfolios listed below are designed primarily as investments for variable annuity and variable life insurance policies issued by insurance companies. They are not publicly traded mutual funds available for direct purchase by you. There is no assurance the investment objectives will be met.

Appendix A: Accumulation Unit Values provides current and historical fund and portfolio names. Adding, Deleting, or Substituting Variable Investment Options We do not control the Subaccounts' underlying portfolios, so we cannot guarantee that any of the portfolios will always be available. We retain the right to change the investments of the Separate Account, and to eliminate the shares of any Subaccount's underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another series fund portfolio, if the shares of an underlying portfolio are no longer available for investment or if, in our judgment, investment in the portfolio would be inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Separate Account. We may add new Separate Account underlying portfolios, or eliminate existing underlying portfolios, when, in our sole discretion, conditions warrant a change. In all of these situations, we will receive any necessary SEC and state approval before making any such change. Our Separate Account may be (i) operated as an investment management company or any other form permitted by law, (ii) deregistered with the SEC if registration is no longer required, or (iii) combined with one or more other separate accounts. To the extent permitted by law, we also may transfer assets of the Separate Account to other accounts. Where permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to remove, combine or add Subaccounts. Subaccounts may be closed to new or subsequent premium payments, transfers or premium allocations. We will receive any necessary SEC and state approval before making any of these changes. We will notify you of any changes to the variable investment options18 Resolving Material Conflicts Underlying Investment Interests In addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the Subaccounts, the portfolios are available to registered separate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. We do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio shares to fund other products. However, there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between Policy Owners and the owners of variable contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios. Shares of some of the portfolios may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of Owners or owners of other contracts (including contracts issued by other companies), and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans. In the event of a material conflict, we will take any necessary steps to resolve the matter, including removing that portfolio as an underlying investment option of the Separate Account. The Board of Directors of each fund company will monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts that may arise and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to those events or conflicts. See the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information. (Also see the Transfers section, Omnibus Orders.) FIXED ACCOUNT INVESTMENT OPTION There is one fixed interest rate option ("Fixed Account"), where we bear the investment risk. We guarantee that you will earn a minimum interest rate that will yield at least 3% per year, compounded annually. We may declare a higher current interest rate. However, you bear the risk that we will not credit more interest than will yield the minimum guaranteed rate per year for the life of the Policy. We have sole discretion over how assets allocated to the Fixed Account are invested, and we bear the risk that those assets will perform better or worse than the amount of interest we have declared. Net Premiums allocated to and transfers to the Fixed Account under the Policy become part of our general account assets, which support annuity and insurance obligations. Interest in the general account has not been registered with the SEC and is not subject to SEC regulation, nor is the general account registered as an investment company with the SEC. The general account includes all of our assets, except those assets segregated in separate accounts. We have sole discretion to invest the assets of the general account, subject to applicable law. Assets in the Fixed Account are subject to claims by creditors of the company. The focus of this prospectus is to disclose the Separate Account aspects of the Policy. Therefore, SEC staff have not reviewed the Fixed Account disclosures in this prospectus. TRANSFERS The Policy is designed for long-term investment, not for use with professional "market timing" services or use with programmed, large or frequent transfers. Excessive transfers could harm other Policy Owners by having a detrimental effect on investment portfolio management. In addition to the right of the portfolios to impose redemption fees on short-term trading, we reserve the right to reject any specific premium allocation or transfer request, if in the judgment of a Subaccount portfolio fund advisor, a Subaccount portfolio would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies, or if Policy owners would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. Transferring money out of a Subaccount within 60 days of a purchase may be considered market timing. However, any portfolio fund adviser may establish its own standards, and each transaction may be evaluated on its own. Ultimately the portfolio fund adviser has the authority to make this determination. Prior to the Annuity Date, you may transfer Policy value from one Subaccount to another, from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account, or from the Fixed Account to any Subaccount, subject to these rules: Transfer Rules: A transfer is considered any single request to move assets from one or more Subaccounts or the Fixed Account to one or more of the other Subaccounts or the Fixed Account. We must receive notice of the transfer - either by Written Notice, an authorized telephone transaction, or by Internet when available. Transfer requests by facsimile, telephone or Internet must be sent to us by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time for same-day processing. Requests received later are processed on the next trading day. Fax requests must be sent to us at If requests are faxed elsewhere, we will process them as of the day they are received by our trading unit19 The transferred amount must be at least $250, or the entire Subaccount or Fixed Account value if it is less. (If the value remaining after a transfer will be less than $250 in a Subaccount or $100 in the Fixed Account, we will include that amount as part of the transfer.) - If the Dollar Cost Averaging systematic transfer program is used, then the minimum transfer amount out of a Subaccount or the Fixed Account is the lesser of $250 or the balance in the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program, the maximum amount that may be transferred from the Fixed Account each month is 1/36 th of the value of the Fixed Account at the time the Dollar Cost Averaging program is established. While a Dollar Cost Averaging program is in effect, elective transfers out of the Fixed Account are prohibited. - The Portfolio Rebalancing and Earnings Sweep systematic transfer programs have no minimum transfer limits. The first 15 transfers each Policy Year are free. Thereafter, transfers may result in a $10 charge for each transfer. This fee is deducted on a pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account; it is not subtracted from the amount of the transfer. Transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward the 15 free transfer limit. A transfer from the Fixed Account (except made pursuant to a systematic transfer program): - may be made only once each Policy Year; - may be delayed up to six months; - is limited during any Policy Year to the greatest of: - 25% of the Fixed account value on the date of the initial transfer during that year; - the greatest amount of any similar transfer out of the Fixed Account during the previous 13 months; or - $1,000. We reserve the right to limit transfers, or to modify transfer privileges, and we reserve the right to change the transfer rules at any time. If the Policy value in any Subaccount falls below $250, we may transfer the remaining balance, without charge, proportionately to the remaining investment options you selected in your latest allocation instructions. We will notify you when such a transfer occurs. You may, within 60 days of the date of our notice, reallocate the amount transferred, without charge, to another investment option. In the event you authorize telephone or Internet transfers, we are not liable for telephone or Internet instructions that we in good faith believe you authorized. We will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine. Omnibus Orders Purchase and redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are "omnibus" orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans and separate accounts funding variable insurance products. The omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual retirement plan participants and individual owners of variable insurance products. The omnibus nature of these orders may limit the ability of the portfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures. We cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies that may invest in the portfolios. These other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and procedures regarding frequent transfer activity. If their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transfer activity, it will affect other owners of portfolio shares, as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts, including ours, whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios. In addition, if a portfolio believes that an omnibus order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from Owners engaged in disruptive trading, the portfolio may reject the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or prevent us from implementing your request. Disruptive Trading Procedures The Policy is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading in response to short-term fluctuations in the market. Such frequent trading, programmed transfers, or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of a Subaccount's underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a Subaccount's underlying portfolio and raise expenses. This in turn can hurt performance of an affected Subaccount and therefore hurt your Policy's performance. Organizations or individuals that use market timing investment strategies and make frequent or other disruptive transfers should not purchase the Policy. Policy Owners should be aware that we are contractually obligated to provide Policy Owner transaction data relating to trading activities to the underlying funds on Written Request and, on receipt of written instructions from a fund, to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by Policy Owners identified by an underlying fund as having engaged in transactions that violate the trading policies of the fund20 We reserve the right to reject or restrict, in our sole discretion, transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party authorized to give transfer instructions. We further reserve the right to impose restrictions on transfers that we determine, in our sole discretion, will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other Policy Owners. Restrictions may include changing, suspending or terminating telephone, on-line and facsimile transfer privileges. We will enforce any Subaccount underlying portfolio manager's restrictions imposed upon transfers considered by the manager to be disruptive. Our disruptive trading procedures may vary from Subaccount to Subaccount, and may also vary due to differences in operational systems and contract provisions. Any Subaccount restrictions will be uniformly applied. There is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective in preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity. Our ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations. The discretionary nature of our disruptive trading procedures may result in some Policy Owners being able to market time while other Policy Owners bear the harm associated with timing. Also, because other insurance companies and retirement plans may invest in Subaccount underlying portfolios, we cannot guarantee that Subaccount underlying portfolios will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within contracts issued by them. Excessive Transfers We reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy Owners. In making this determination, we will consider, among other things: the total dollar amount being transferred; the number of transfers you make over a period of time; whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations, particularly within certain Subaccount underlying portfolios; whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of individual Policy Owners in the group; and the investment objectives and/or size of the Subaccount underlying portfolio. Third Party Traders We reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple Policy Owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy Owners. In making this determination, we may, among other things: reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one Policy Owner, or reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual Policy Owners who have executed transfer forms which are submitted by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Policy Owner. We will notify affected Policy Owners before we limit transfers, modify transfer procedures or refuse to complete a transfer. Transfers made pursuant to participation in a dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing, or earnings sweep program are not subject to these disruptive trading procedures. See the section of this prospectus describing those programs for the rules of each program. SYSTEMATIC TRANSFER PROGRAMS We offer several systematic transfer programs. We reserve the right to alter or terminate these programs upon thirty days written notice. Dollar Cost Averaging The Dollar Cost Averaging program allows you to automatically transfer, on a periodic basis, a set dollar amount or percentage from the Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account to any other Subaccount(s) or the Fixed Account. Requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount. You can begin Dollar Cost Averaging when you purchase the Policy or later. You can increase or decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue the program at any time. Dollar Cost Averaging programs are intended to limit loss and result in the purchase of more Accumulation Units when a portfolio's value is low, and fewer units when its value is high. However, there is no guarantee that such a program will result in a higher Policy value, protect against a loss, or otherwise achieve your investment goals  View more

Applicants' Representations
1. The Life Insurance Companies, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective separate accounts, propose to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolio for shares of the Current Portfolio held by the Accounts to fund the Contracts.
2. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. is the depositor and sponsor of the Ameritas Life Accounts. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York is the depositor and sponsor of the Ameritas Life of NY Accounts. The Union Central Life Insurance Company is the depositor and sponsor of the Carillon Life Account.
3. Each Account is a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act, and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust. Security interests under the Contracts have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). The application sets forth the registration statement file numbers for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts.
4. Each Account is divided into subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding investment portfolio (a “Portfolio”) of a series-type management investment company, including CVSI.
5. Pursuant to the Contracts, the Life Insurance Companies reserve the right to substitute shares of one Portfolio for shares of another. The prospectuses for the Contracts also disclose that the Life Insurance Companies reserve this right.
6. CVSI is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-03591) that currently consists of six investment portfolios, including the Current Portfolio, and issues a separate series of shares in connection with each. CVSI has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 002-80154).
7. Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (“CIM”) serves as the investment adviser to each CVSI Portfolio. CIM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AMHC.
8. The VIPFV is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-05361) that currently consists of 32 investment portfolios, one of which, the Replacement Portfolio, is the subject of the proposed Substitution. VIPFV issues a separate series of shares in connection with each Portfolio and has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 033-17704).
9. Fidelity Management & Research Company (“FMR”) serves as the manager of each Portfolio of VIPFV. FMR receives an investment management fee from each Portfolio. Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (“FIMM”) and other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio. FIMM has the day-to-day responsibility of choosing investments for the Replacement Portfolio. In addition, other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio and may provide investment research and advice for the Replacement Portfolio. None of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM, or other affiliates of FMR are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated person) of any of the Applicants. Likewise, none of the Applicants are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated persons) of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM or other affiliates of FMR.
10. The Applicants state that Replacement Portfolio's and Current Portfolio's respective investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same. A comparison of the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Replacement Portfolio and the Current Portfolio is included in the application.
11. The following table compares the fees and expenses of the Current Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio as of the year ended December 31, 2012:
 Current portfolioReplacement portfolioCalvert Variable Series, Inc., Calvert VP Money Market PortfolioVariable Insurance Products Fund V, VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial ClassManagement Fee0.25%0.17%.Distribution and Service (12b-1) FeeNoneNone.Other Expenses0.14%0.09%.Total Operating Expenses0.39%0.26%.Fee Waivers and Expense ReimbursementsNone 1None.Net Operating Expenses0.39% 20.26%.1 The Investment Advisor, CIM, has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through April 30, 2014 to 0.40%. Under the terms of the contractual expense limitation, operating expenses do not include interest expense, brokerage commissions, taxes and extraordinary expenses. Only the Board of Directors of CVSI may terminate a Portfolio's expense cap before the contractual period expires.2 The Advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of $88,900 or 0.11%, for Net Operating Expenses of 0.28% to maintain a positive yield during the year ended December 31, 2012.
12. The Applicants state that the proposed Substitution is in response to a decision by the Board of Directors for CVSI, at a meeting held on June 5, 2013, to approve the dissolution of the Current Portfolio on or about November 15, 2013 (the “Liquidation Date”). The board's decision to liquidate the Current Portfolio requires the Life Insurance Companies to transfer accumulated Contract value invested in the Current Portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the Contracts on or before the Liquidation Date. Currently, the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the Contracts is the Current Portfolio. Accordingly, the proposed Substitution is necessary in order to provide the Contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option. Consequently, the Life Insurance Companies have determined to replace the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio via the Substitution.
13. The Life Insurance Companies submit that the Replacement Portfolio is an appropriate alternative for Contract owners for several reasons. First, its investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the Current Portfolio. Second, it is substantially larger than the Current Portfolio, has had lower overall expense levels than the Portfolio in recent years, and has had higher yields in recent years than the Current Portfolio. Third, the Contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the Life Insurance Companies currently offer one or more VIPFV portfolios (other than the Replacement Portfolio).
14. The Applicants believe that Contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the Replacement Portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the Replacement Portfolio, as contrasted Start Printed Page 65395with the size and recent yields of the Current Portfolio. The yield for the Current Portfolio for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.01%. The net asset value of the Current Portfolio was $85,913,000 as of December 31, 2012. The yield for the Replacement Portfolio Initial Class shares for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.08%. The net asset value of the Replacement Portfolio supporting Initial Class shares was $889,797,000 as of December 31, 2012.
15. The Applicants believe that Contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the Replacement Portfolio as compared to the Current Portfolio. Specifically, the management fee, other expenses, and total operating expenses are less than those of the Current Portfolio. Both Portfolios have no charge for Rule 12b-1 distribution and services fees. The total annual operating expense of the Replacement Portfolio is less than that of the Current Portfolio. Given this decrease, the Applicants believe that the Substitution would benefit Contract owners by reducing the overall level of Portfolio expenses.
Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitution. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust.
2. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution is not the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Section 26(c) was intended to provide for Commission scrutiny of a proposed Substitution which could, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both, as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption. Consequently, the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holder's only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security, or to elect a costly and, in effect, forced redemption.
3. Applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide Contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include Section 26(c).
4. Applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. All redemptions of shares of the Current Portfolio and purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolio will be effected in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The Substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the Substitution (“Effective Date”) with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable Account.
5. Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio will be transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge. Contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the Life Insurance Companies' respective obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way and the Substitution will not change Contract owners' insurance benefits under the Contracts. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitution, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage commissions, will be paid by the Life Insurance Companies. In addition, the Substitution will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners.
6. The Applicants also represent that the Substitution will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Life Insurance Companies will not exercise any right they may have under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the Contracts for the period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date.
7. Existing Contract owners will be notified of the proposed Substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the Contracts (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) at least thirty (30) days before the Effective Date. New purchasers of the Contracts will be provided the Pre-Substitution Notice, the Contract prospectus, and the prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
8. The Pre-Substitution Notice will: (i) State that the Applicants filed the application seeking approval of the Substitution; (ii) set forth the anticipated Effective Date; (iii) explain that the Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio would be attributable to the Replacement Portfolio as of the Effective Date; (iv) state that, from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice until the Effective Date, Contract Owners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Current Portfolio sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contract; (v) advise Contract owners that any contract value remaining in the Current Portfolio sub-account on the Effective Date will be transferred to a sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio, and that the Substitution will take place at relative net asset value; (vi) inform Contract owners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the applicable Life Insurance Company will permit Contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio to any other available sub-accounts offered under their Contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees, if any, that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contracts; and (vii) inform Contract owners that, except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus, the applicable Life Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio for at least thirty (30) days after the Effective Date.
9. All Contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio prior to the Substitution. In addition, within five (5) days following the Substitution, Contract owners affected by the Substitution will be notified in writing that the Substitution was carried out. This notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice, and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio were transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge Start Printed Page 65396(including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge.
10. The Applicants represent that the Life Insurance Companies will not receive, for three (3) years after the Effective Date, any direct or indirect benefits from the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), in connection with assets attributable to the Contracts affected by the Substitution, at a higher rate than the Life Insurance Companies had received from the Current Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), including without limitation 12b-1 fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements. The Applicants further represent that the Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a Life Insurance Company or its affiliates by the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter, or their affiliates.
11. Applicants submit that the replacement of the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio is consistent with the protection of Contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act and, thus, meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution meets the standards that the Commission and its staff have applied to Substitutions that have been approved in the past.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application, the Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and should therefore be granted.

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

	The Board of Directors of Calvert Variable Products, Inc. ("CVP")
	has approved a resolution to reorganize the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio into the Calvert VP Investment Grade
	Bond Index Portfolio (the "Reorganization"). Each Portfolio is a series of Calvert Variable Products, Inc.


	 


	The CVP Board has recommended approval of the Reorganization
	by shareholders of the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio. If the Reorganization is approved by the shareholders of
	the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio, it will be merged into the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio
	on or about November 14, 2014. If your variable annuity Contract or variable life insurance Policy remains allocated to the Subaccount
	corresponding to the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio at the time the Reorganization is consummated, those units will
	be replaced by units corresponding to the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio, and thereafter the value of your Contract
	or Policy will depend on the performance of the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio rather than the Calvert VP Inflation
	Protected Plus Portfolio. The number of Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio units you receive will depend on the value
	of your Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio units at the time the Reorganization takes place.


	 


	If the Reorganization is approved, your prospectus is revised
	by deleting all mention of the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio at the time of the Reorganization.


	 


	All other provisions remain as stated in your
	Contract or Policy and prospectus, as supplemented.


	 



	Please retain this Supplement with the
	current prospectus for your variable Contract or Policy with




	Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.




	 




	If you do not have a current prospectus,
	please contact Ameritas Life at 1-800-745-1112.
