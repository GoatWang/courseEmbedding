Pay It Forward
Starting in 2008, Bell Bank gave employees a very special Christmas gift: the opportunity to “pay it forward” to people in need. It’s become a tradition continued each year. Every full-time employee receives $1,000 and every part-time employee $500 to give to an individual, family, organization or cause – a commitment totaling more than half a million dollars annually. To date, more than $8 million has been given to others less fortunate and to organizations that help build our communities.
 
Paying it forward is about compassionately helping others. Our employees’ Pay It Forward stories of giving will touch your heart.

Bell State Bank & Trust Case Study











Bell State Bank & Trust expanded into new markets and increased mobile banking adoption with Mobile Source Capture™ from Fiserv.
After introducing Mobile Source Capture from Fiserv to its customers, Bell State Bank & Trust watched the number of mobile deposits grow from hundreds to thousands in the first month.
Challenge
Bell State Bank & Trust’s challenge was twofold: expand into a new city with no ATM presence and limited branches, and offer a new product to keep the bank ahead of the market.
Solution
Mobile Source Capture helped the bank strategize both challenges. New and current customers can deposit checks from anywhere with a smartphone, and Bell State Bank & Trust offered a new product that boosts Mobiliti user activity and drives mobile deposit growth.
Proof Points
After implementing Mobile Source Capture, the bank:

Boosted mobile deposits from hundreds to thousands in the first month
Attracted new customers, aiding successful expansion in a new market
Reduced risk with the duplicate deposit feature available in a single source capture platform
Maintained market position over its competition
