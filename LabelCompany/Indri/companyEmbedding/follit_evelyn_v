She led the transformation of RadioShack IT from a very broken 70s model to state of the art by surrounding herself with good people and helping them to do what they do best.  Her knowledge of finance and her ability to manage out and up also helped IT, as well as RadioShack as a whole, move to a much more respected and profitable enterprise.  I am so glad that I had the chance to work for her and would do so again without hesitation.See moreSee lessEvelyn and I worked side by side at D&B in a three person organization charged with having all the systems in place to assure the attraction, retention and rewarding the officers of D&B and the officers of the operating companies. She played a pivital role in the planning and successful execution of spliting the company into three new NYSE listed companies - in record time (less than nine months.)
As an exuctive search consultant, I turned to Evelyn for assistance in finding a highly qulaified person to head the HR organization for Tandy (RadioShack.) While working with me on the assignment, she "raised her hand" to be considered for the position.
