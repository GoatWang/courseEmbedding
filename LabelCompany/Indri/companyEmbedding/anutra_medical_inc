The revolutionary Anutra Syringe is designed to give feedback during administration. A subtle click is positioned at every milliliter increment to provide haptic and audible feedback to the practitioner. Use the Anutra Syringe with any luer lock needle of your choice.

Improve Workflow
Efficiency is critical in every clinical environment. Buffering with Anutra increases the predictability of local anesthetic as well as the onset time. With a smooth, streamlined workflow, patients receive the highest level of service possible and clinicians stay on time and run an efficient, predictable schedule.























































































































Patient Experience
Patient experience is more important than ever before. Buffered anesthetic with Anutra reduces the burning sensation a patient feels when they receive an injection. With more options for patient's to choose from, providing exemplary patient experience could be the difference between that patient scheduling an appointment.









































 





Safety and Regulation

Via patented filtered, uni-flow and sterile path technology, the Anutra Dispenser and Cassette are able to maintain sterility of multi-dose vials for up to seven days. Using the Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System reduces cross contamination risk of multi-dose vials. This eliminates the need to draw up anesthetic in advance, leaving it to sit open for hours.

Anutra Dispenser by Anutra Medical - Buffering Simplified

The Anutra Dispenser
Buffering Simplified.

				The Anutra Dispenser is a ground-breaking, local anesthetic
				delivery and buffering solution allowing you to never leave
				your patient’s side after administrering local anesthetic.
			
LEARN MORE ABOUT BUFFERING














Precision buffering.

						The Anutra Dispenser allows you to simply measure out precise doses
						of buffered anesthetic each and every time by twisting the knob.
					














Sleek appearance.

						With a small footprint and ergonomic design,
						you can place your Anutra Dispenser in every
						operatory without having to make room for a large, complex device.
					







Save Time. Make Money.

				Imagine being able to fit extra patients in your schedule
				and still send everyone home on time.  By harnessing the
				power of buffering local anesthetics along with the Anutra
				Medical Local Anesthetic Delivery System you never have to
				leave your patient’s side after injecting and you can go to work more quickly.
			






Why Buffer Local Anesthetics?






Increased Predictability of Numbing

				Buffering can elevate the depth of anesthesia increasing the
				likelihood of patients getting numb the first time.
			







Efficiency in Your Schedule

				Buffered anesthetics can cross the nerve membrane more
				readily allowing a patient to become numb quickly.
			







Can Reduce Patient Pain

				Buffering can lower the high level of acid typically
				found in local anesthetics which can reduce the burning pain after injection.

Anesthetics Syringes, Needles & Accessories Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System                     PRODUCT FAMILY               Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System    Anutra Medical, Inc http://www.anutramedical.com         Product Description  Anutra Medical's Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System is a new way to simply buffer local anesthetics. Not only is the currently used, unbuffered anesthetic acidic, it typically takes the anesthetic upwards of 15 minutes to cross the nerve membrane and ultimately numb a patient. The Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System is able to bring the acidity level of the anesthetic closer to what is found naturally in the body. As a result, buffered anesthetic crosses the nerve membrane very easily allowing a patient to become more numb within minutes of injection, while simultaneously reducing the pain of injection caused by the acidic anesthetic.

Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System
Anutra Medical Inc.





“I didn’t even know you gave me a shot,” Barb said as Dr. Kelly picked up his handpiece and went to work immediately. For decades, the idea of getting a dental injection has terrified patients. Quite frankly, the uncertainty, unpredictability and long onset time of local anesthetic equally terrifies the practitioner.
The Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System redefines local anesthetic delivery. It radically enhances patient experience and comfort while transforming a practitioner’s efficiency, profitability — as well as the profundity and predictability of local anesthetic.
Age-old science made simple
Buffering is an age-old science that has been used in the medical community for decades. Buffering is simply taking something acidic, mixing it with something more basic to neutralize the acid.
So why does this matter in dentistry? Lidocaine with epinephrine has a low pH, meaning it is extremely acidic. In fact, its pH is close to that of citric acid, which is found in limes and lemons. Could you imagine injecting lemon juice into someone’s mouth? We simply would not do that.
Much of the burning and stinging sensation comes from the fact that local anesthetic is very acidic. The Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System makes buffering simple. By loading an Anutra Cassette at the beginning of the week, clinicians can simply buffer anesthetic for every patient by twisting the knob on the Anutra Dispenser. It could not be easier.
Topical effect, too
What adds to the amazing power of buffered anesthetic is a topical effect that is a result of a CO2 microbubble that is formed when local anesthetic is mixed with sodium bicarbonate. Many practitioners report dropping a small amount on the mucosa prior to injecting for a very powerful topical anesthetic.
Not only is patient comfort increased with buffered anesthetic, a practitioner’s efficiency is dramatically optimized. Since buffered anesthetic is raised to physiologic pH, the anesthetic crosses the nerve membrane more readily, meaning a patient can reach pulpal anesthesia in as little as two minutes, even with blocks. Additionally, anywhere from 4,000–6,000 times the active molecules of anesthetic will cross the nerve membrane, making it more profound than normal lidocaine as well as increasing the predictability that a patient will get numb the first time, even on those hard-to-numb patients.
Disposable, multidose, one-handed aspiration syringe
Not only does the Anutra Local Anesthetic Delivery System provide a simple platform for you to buffer in your practice, it also introduces the first-known, FDA approved, multidose, one-handed aspiration syringe that is fully disposable.
So what does that mean? It means that you can hold up to 6 mL of anesthetic in one single syringe. There is no need to reload cartridges; one syringe can hold the equivalent of at least three traditional 1.8 mL dental cartridges.
According to the company, with its affordable cost, revolutionary new syringe, simple dosing system and long shelf-life, the Anutra Local Anesthetic is a no-brainer for every dental practice.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!
