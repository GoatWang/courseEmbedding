Chiasma's Product Development Effort












 Chiasma is focused on improving the lives of patients who face challenges associated with existing treatments for their rare and debilitating diseases. The company's proprietary Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE®) technology platform is designed to enable the intestinal absorption of molecules that would otherwise have limited intestinal bioavailability.
Chiasma’s investigational product candidate, octreotide capsules (conditionally trade named Mycapssa®), is being developed for the potential treatment of acromegaly, a rare, debilitating disease. Chiasma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients who face challenges associated with existing treatments for their rare and debilitating diseases. Employing its Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE®) technology platform, Chiasma is developing octreotide capsules (conditionally trade named Mycapssa®), as a potential new oral therapy for acromegaly.  
The company has completed an international Phase 3 trial of octreotide capsules, the results of which have been published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to the New Drug Application (NDA) for octreotide capsules, indicating that their review is complete and the NDA is not ready for approval in its present form.  The FDA has strongly recommended that we conduct a new randomized, double-blind, controlled trial that enrolls patients from the U.S. and is of sufficiently long duration to ensure that control of disease activity is stable at the time point selected for the primary efficacy assessment. While we acknowledge the FDA’s feedback, we continue to evaluate various potential paths forward.
The company is currently conducting, MPOWERED™, an international Phase 3 trial of octreotide capsules for the potential maintenance treatment of adult acromegaly patients to support a potential Marketing Authorization Application with the European Medicines Agency.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We get the best ratings
IPO Candy has been recognized since 2009 as the single best place to get commentary, analysis and assets in the IPO market. The most common write-in comment we get from users is that they "love what we do."

Chiasma Announces Completion of $70 Million Series E Financing

NEWTON, Mass. and JERUSALEM, Feb. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Chiasma, Inc., a U.S. privately-held biopharma company developing octreotide capsules, its lead product for the orphan condition acromegaly, today announced the closing of a $70 million Series E financing round. Participants in the financing included new investors Rock Springs Capital and Sofinnova Ventures, and an undisclosed blue chip public investment fund, as well as existing investors MPM Capital, F2 Capital, 7 Med Health Ventures, Abingworth and ARCH Venture Partners. 
Chiasma intends to use the new capital to build its sales and marketing capabilities and prepare for the U.S. commercial launch of its lead product, octreotide capsules for adults with acromegaly, a rare endocrine disease. The company intends to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for octreotide capsules in the second quarter of 2015 and, if the NDA is approved, to launch the product in the U.S. soon thereafter. If approved, octreotide capsules would be the first and only oral somatostatin analog, providing another option to patients currently receiving painful injections.
Chiasma will also conduct additional clinical studies for octreotide capsules to support approval in the European Union and advance new product candidates based on its proprietary Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE®) technology into preclinical development.
"The commitment from both new and existing investors provide us with the resources to advance our regulatory efforts, prepare for a successful launch of octreotide capsules, test oral octreotide capsules for additional indications and further invest in earlier-stage TPE programs that can fuel our growth over the long term," stated Roni Mamluk, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Chiasma. "With this financing in place, we are well positioned to advance a portfolio of oral drugs that address unmet needs in orphan indications." 
About Acromegaly
Acromegaly typically develops when a benign tumor of the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH), ultimately leading to significant health problems and early death if untreated. Common features of acromegaly are facial changes, intense headaches, joint pain, impaired vision and enlargement of the hands, feet and tongue. Serious associated health conditions include diabetes, hypertension, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disorders. 
Current treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy which destroys any lingering tumor cells and/or medical treatment in cases where these approaches are not possible or fully effective. Medical treatments available currently include dopamine agonists, GH antagonists and injectable somatostatin analogs, the current standard of care. Currently available somatostatin analogs require large-bore needles, for injection into muscle (octreotide) or deep into the tissue underlying the skin (lanreotide). 
Researchers estimate that three to four out of every million people develop acromegaly each year. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, acromegaly occurs in approximately 60 people per million in the United States. Because symptoms often develop slowly, diagnosis may be delayed by years or decades, making it difficult to determine the total number of people with the disease. 
About Octreotide Capsules  
Octreotide capsules are an investigational oral form of the peptide octreotide, a somatostatin analog that is currently available only by injection. Octreotide capsules use a proprietary technology developed by Chiasma, Inc., called Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE®) that facilitates gastrointestinal absorption of unmodified drug into the bloodstream. Chiasma is independently leading the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of octreotide capsules for the potential treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. 
About Chiasma 
Chiasma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare diseases by developing and commercializing oral medications that were previously available by injection only. The company's lead candidate is octreotide capsules, which has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA. Chiasma is evaluating additional proteins, peptides and small molecule drugs that that are currently only available by injection but could potentially be converted to oral delivery using the company's TPE® technology. Chiasma is a Delaware corporation with a wholly owned Israeli subsidiary.
