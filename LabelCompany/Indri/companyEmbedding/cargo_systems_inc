About Us






						Cargo Door Spring Assembly Systems, Engineered for Maximum Safety 
					







Our counter balance spring assembly systems deliver safe, smooth, easy operation of your cargo door, time and time again. 
							






Here's why Cargo Systems is the industry's leading counter balance spring assembly specialist:










Our first product, the Ramp-Heister, a ramp door spring assembly, was introduced in 1989. It was developed when cargo trailer manufacturers demanded a solution that was safer and easier to operate than traditional roll-up and wing doors commonly used. Our Ramp-Heister set the standard in the counter balance spring assembly industry. We never anticipated how much the Cargo Trailer and Toy Hauler industries would grow - increasing the demand for and success of our products. 
Cargo Systems became the industry leader by setting safe, efficient torsion spring operating standards for cargo trailer ramp doors. It's a standard we maintain today.




Cargo Systems is a member of the National Association of Trailer Manufacturers (NATM). 





Safety doesn't cost more. We know there's a lot more riding behind a properly installed ramp door than people think. The single most important measure of quality at Cargo Systems is the safety of our products. Safe, smooth operation, time and time again is the standard we hold our business to.
Cargo Systems is constantly evolving as a company developing new and innovative solutions for the Cargo Trailer, Toy Hauler and RV industries. This is evident in our latest product, the Comfort AER Screen, a rear screen cargo shade. This smooth, easy to operate pull-down insect screen stops at any point, creates shade and enhances airflow. With our three-piece design, installation is a snap.

Developers of the Cargo Manager suite of applications

Cargo Manager Systems, Inc. is a leading software provider to 
				NVOCCs, freight forwarders, importers, and warehouses.
Our cloud based products are accessed by thousands of users every day, originating from over 50 countries spread over 6 continents.
In September 2004, we added Electronic
				In-Bond filing for warehouses, whereby a warehouse can file
				a request with U.S. Customs for an In-bond move and receive a 
				response in minutes, eliminating paper and speeding the process.
				This facility can be web based or local server based.
Our E-Commerce, 
				a web based facility, allows customers of an NVOCC or forwarder
				to request quotes, make bookings, look up schedule, and track 
				cargo on imports and exports directly from the NVOCC's or 
				forwarder's database in real time.
Our CFS Availability
				is a very popular web based application used by most CFSes in
				the New York metropolitan area and throughout the USA.  It 
				provides real time cargo status and requirements for pickup to 
				the CFS's customers.  Customers can use our
				Customer Login
				to view further details of their shipments.
			
In 2013 CMS has been certified by US CBP as a service bureau for Air AMS, in addition to being a service center for Ocean AMS, AES, ABI, ISF as well as Canadian ACI and Japanese AFR.

Testimonials

“I love it, I love it, I love it, and I love you guys. I can’t believe my Uber rating is a 4.9 now! It’s unbelievable. All my passengers are so surprised and excited when they see it and I’ve received a ton of comments and higher tips.”

— Anthony J.


The Cargo program was very powerful for me, and I believe that any driver that uses it will make a significant amount of money on top of the income they’re making through rides. It’s also very beneficial for the riders - 90% of the passengers who saw it were really engaged with it.

— Larry M.


When passengers see the box, they get super excited. It’s been a great way to engage with riders and start a conversation. I’ve noticed higher ratings from the passengers who receive free items, and I’m making an extra $20-$50 a week that I didn’t have before Cargo.

— Qas B.
