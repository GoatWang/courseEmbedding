DistinctionAdvantageHistorySocial Commitment



An industry leader in providing customized managed services and investment counsel exclusively to high net worth individuals, families and foundations with $20 million or more in investable assets, Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC (Bel Air) distinguishes itself through its diverse mix of “best-in-class” proprietary and sub-advisory investment strategies, within its open architecture platform.
It further distinguishes itself by its very size — big enough to have formed solid relationships with leading globally-focused asset managers while small enough to tenaciously adhere to a single-minded and personalized approach to investing that provides accessibility, at all times, to decision makers of a client’s portfolio.
The firm’s leading Investment advisors, some with over 35 years of investment experience who oversee and manage approximately $7 billion in assets, have navigated industry fluctuations and diverse market conditions. They have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to cater to specific client needs and preferences, in virtually every situation.
Bel Air advisors’ keen understanding, objectivity, comprehensive knowledge and integrated experience in the market, are key in identifying and selecting the most appropriate investment options for each of their clients’ and in protecting and preserving their wealth.
Bel Air upholds the highest standards of professionalism and integrity and achieves excellence through strong management practices, sound business principles and the highest level of ethical behavior.
 
Clients face complex financial decisions — whether selling a business or other substantial asset, taking a company public, inheriting a large sum of capital, experiencing a divorce situation, or bearing responsibilities for investing foundation assets. Clients value the relationship with highly experienced investment advisors who have helped solve every critical investment challenge with a customized approach to addressing specific financial needs.
Bel Air’s advisors stay at the forefront of the industry landscape, continuously assessing industry trends, legislative forces and market shifts. They are focused on seeking out creative means to unlock potential opportunities and negotiate challenges on a client’s behalf.
Of particular note, are the firm’s market and technical sophistication, as well as its investment expertise, which reflects an astute understanding of, and sensitivity to, clients’ risk/reward preferences. Clients trust the firm’s advisors to guide them in managing the responsibilities and challenges inherent in protecting their wealth, and hold that guidance in high esteem.
As part of its private client service offering, the firm leverages its numerous relationships with asset managers, both domestically and internationally focused, who complement Bel Air’s financial knowledge and proprietary investment strategies. This affords clients the widest selection and the most appropriate investment options.
Its open architecture and private ownership structure enables Bel Air Investment Advisors to align clients’ interests with market opportunities, delivering top-tier investment strategies and strong long-term returns.
 
Bel Air’s founders Todd Morgan, Reed Halladay and Darell Krasnoff are widely respected in the investment community. While at Goldman Sachs & Co the three were leaders in Wall Street’s transition from brokerage to discretionary fee-based client services. Since founding Bel Air over a decade ago, the Firm has added significant professional talent and continues to use their expertise in the delivery of Bel Air’s premier client service model.
Bel Air was founded in 1997 as a wealth management firm.
 
Bel Air believes in corporate social responsibility within the community in which it does business and, as such, takes part in many philanthropic activities as a company. Bel Air’s philanthropic program supports employees’ selection of their own organizations and nonprofits, through the offering of an annual match donation for each employee to give to a charitable organization of their choice. Moreover, the firm encourages employees to participate in charitable activities of their choosing, by giving them paid time off for that purpose.
Bel Air regularly supports local organizations through hands-on, group community projects in addition to financial support. Bel Air has supported numerous foundations and organizations through Board membership, donations, and volunteering. Examples include but are not limited to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles Music Center, City of Hope, Pasadena Museum of California Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and more.

ApproachProcessObjectivesStrategy



Bel Air’s investment management experience assists clients in clarifying their goals and objectives and identifying appropriate investment strategies to reach those goals. Bel Air’s investment advisors have counseled clients in the most difficult and rewarding financial market conditions, applying unsurpassed investment knowledge that protects their wealth through sound and prudent diversification.
The firm’s portfolios encompass an ever-broadening scope of alternative investments such as private equity, real estate and hedge funds. Advisors are dedicated to identifying asset managers who have a history of steadfast, high-quality performance that is consistent with the firm’s emphasis on protecting and building clients’ capital.
Additionally, Bel Air wealth advisors are sensitive to the role that family dynamics plays when it comes to intergenerational wealth transfers. As such, they interact personally with all of the family members who are affected by the investment strategy, garnering in the process a greater understanding as to how to counsel the next generation on the responsibilities and skills necessary to maintain their wealth.
 
 
As an independent firm dedicated exclusively to managing assets for wealthy individuals, families and foundations, the firm adheres to a rigorous investment selection process.
The firm holds fast to a “best in class” investment philosophy, evaluating a global landscape of information and opportunity in the context of individual client goals and tax considerations.
Bel Air stands steadfast on the premise that effective wealth management is built on a disciplined investment process and integrated expertise in investment advisory services, research and asset management. The melding of these fundamental disciplines is a core part of Bel Air’s distinct process – and presents important advantages for clients in clarifying goals and objectives, and identifying appropriate investment strategies to reach those goals.
For many clients, their primary goal being “preservation of capital,” the firm’s investment process is designed to develop strategies that have the potential to yield the highest after-tax returns with the least amount correspondence of risk. For those seeking a higher level of asset growth, the wealth advisors employ extensive market and technical acumen to select appropriate investments.
Bel Air’s three-pronged process integrates expertise in investment management services, research and asset management and includes:

Identifying Objectives
Constructing The Investment Strategy
Evaluating Performance Against Objectives

 
Identifying clients’ objectives is central to developing sound investment strategies to meet their needs. The firm uses quantitative and qualitative assessments to help formulate strategies that take into account a client’s risk tolerance and seek to provide consistent after-tax returns over time. As part of this analysis, there are several considerations including, but not limited to:

Current holdings and the strategy behind existing portfolio
Current and future tax status
Estate / Next generation planning
Lifestyle aspirations and income needs
Charitable interests
Tolerance for market volatility

While clients come to Bel Air for a variety of reasons – including the sale of a business, inheritance, change in life circumstance, they tend to have key common objectives, among them:

Preserving the real value of assets after taxes and inflation
Generating sufficient income to maintain desired lifestyle
Building the value of assets without taking inappropriate risks or sacrificing required income

 
Wealth advisors work with clients to identify the most appropriate asset allocation to achieve their investment objectives. Asset allocation requires an understanding of client specific issues and consideration of the economic and market environment. Most importantly, a disciplined approach reflects a longer-term investment focus that seeks to achieve consistent, risk-adjusted after-tax returns over time. Expert analysis yields a customized investment strategy tailored to a client’s specific objectives. The firm allocates assets across four major categories: equities, fixed income, alternative investments and cash.
Equities are part of the growth component in a portfolio. An equities portfolio should be well-diversified by capitalization (e.g., large and small cap stocks), geography (e.g., international and domestic stocks) and style (e.g., core, growth, and value stocks).
Fixed Income is the foundation of an investment portfolio, providing predictable, steady cash flow with lower risk of capital loss.
Alternative Investments include vehicles such as hedge funds, real assets (such as energy and real estate) and private equity. They are generally less liquid than equities or fixed income, offer returns that are potentially less correlated to the public equity and fixed income markets and have the potential to achieve higher returns. Adding investments with low correlation to other strategies in a portfolio generally reduces the volatility of portfolio returns.
Cash allocations are most appropriate for situations demanding high levels of liquidity. Cash investments include simple money-market funds with attractive yields, floating-rate municipal instruments, discount U.S. agencies and other short-term fixed income securities.
A customized solution is constructed from a range of strategies and services provided by Bel Air and other proven organizations.

The Team
Bel Air’s most significant asset is its people – a team comprised of top financial analysts, investment advisors, research professionals, portfolio managers and fixed income and equity traders, affording the firm’s comprehensive market knowledge. Bel Air’s advisors and asset managers are much-sought after resources to the financial media and have regularly been quoted in financial media including The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Barron’s, Fortune, Bloomberg Businessweek, and more.
This integrated experience, coupled with the fact that Bel Air advisors and asset managers themselves invest in many of the same investment strategies that they recommend to their clients, re-enforces the firm’s conviction in its advice and process for selecting the most appropriate investment options, based on individual client needs.

When Markets Collide: Investment Strategies for the Age of Global Economic Change
 
SELECTED AS A 2008 BEST BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR BY THE ECONOMIST "ONE OF THE SMARTEST INVESTORS ON THE PLANET."--MONEY MAGAZINE “This book is an essential read for those who wish to understand the modern world of investing.” —Alan GreenspanWinner of the 2008 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award When Markets Collide is a timely alert to the fundamental changes taking place in today's global economic and financial systems--and a call to action for investors who may fall victim to misinterpreting important signals. While some have tended to view asset class mispricings as mere “noise,” this compelling book shows why they are important signals of opportunities and risks that will shape the market for years to come. One of today's most respected names in finance, Mohamed El-Erian puts recent events in their proper context, giving you the tools that can help you interpret the markets, benefit from global economic change, and navigate the risks.The world economy is in the midst of a series of hand-offs. Global growth is now being heavily influenced by nations that previously had little or no systemic influence. Former debtor nations are building unforeseen wealth and, thus, enjoying unprecedented influence and facing unusual challenges. And new derivative products have changed the behavior of many market segments and players. Yet, despite all these changes, the system's infrastructure is yet to be upgraded to reflect the realities of today's and tomorrow's world. El-Erian investigates the underlying drivers of global change to shed light on how you should:Think about the new opportunities and risks Construct an appropriately diversified and internationalized portfolio Protect your portfolio against new sources of systemic risk Best think about the impact of central banks and financial policies around the worldOffering up predictions of future developments, El-Erian directs his focus to help you capitalize on the new financial landscape, while limiting exposure to new risk configurations.When Markets Collide is a unique collection of books for investors and policy makers around the world. In addition to providing a thorough analysis and clear perspective of recent events, it lays down a detailed map for navigating your way through an otherwise perplexing new economic landscape.

Macroeconomic Investment Strategies for an Era of Economic Uncertainty“Over the years, Francois’ insightful analyses of the business cycle has led to market calls that have both benefitted investors on the upside and (more important to many) protected them from losses on the downside. Francois’ incredible track record in successfully interpreting the trends that can be found in leading indicators and other macroeconomic data have also led to his well deserved reputation as an expert in sector rotation - providing investors on both the long and short side of the market opportunities to profit from his ideas. In my opinion, his most important and influential macro prediction to date was his call in the middle of the last decade when he predicted that the worst housing crisis in American history would soon be upon us, and that it would have far-ranging implications for both the global economy and world financial markets.”From the foreword by Robert Doll, Vice Chairman & CIO of Global Equities, Blackrock Advisors, LLC“Francois Trahan is an insightful observer and student of market forces. His research has identified key drivers of stock market performance over decades in various cycles of inflation, credit growth, and economic developments. In his new book, Francois tries to sort out and explain for market participants the dynamics that brought us to this point and what he sees as the future path of economic and market developments. It is an essential read for anyone participating in or interested in the stock market.”Robert Soros, Chairman, Soros Fund Management“The Era of Uncertainty is terrific. It challenges conventional Wall Street wisdom, gives investors the necessary tools to successfully navigate the new world order and has policy prescriptions to get the U.S. economy on the right track.”Consuelo Mack, Anchor & Managing Editor, Consuelo Mack WealthTrack“Valuation is not everything. An important lesson from the global financial crisis is that macro matters. In The Era of Uncertainty, Francois Trahan and Katharine Krantz show how macroeconomic analysis can be incorporated into the investment process and provide a road map for investing in the difficult times ahead.”Edward Chancellor, Author of Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation and member of GMO's Asset Allocation team“Francois consistently sets a high bar for strategist and thought leaders in the markets, and I can safely say he’s done it yet again with this book. Always insightful, and willing to challenge the ‘stale’ thinking of the establishment on The Street, Francois' thoughts and analysis are appropriate for anyone who cares not only about markets, but the future of our world.”Jeff deGraaf, Chairman, Renaissance Macro Research, LLCWith macro forces governing the post-credit crisis world, and most likely to remain dominant for some time to come, the power of the business cycle is once again in the spotlight. In this type of environment, stock picking will have far less impact on portfolio returns than getting the "big picture" right. And using the last twenty years as a playbook will prove costly to investors.The Era of Uncertainty provides a new way of thinking about investing in a dynamic, macro-driven world. In it, Francois Trahan and Katherine Krantz discuss the importance of macroeconomic perspectives in an unstable global economy. They go on to cover three possible future scenarios: inflation, deflation, or the middle ground. With each scenario the authors discusses the likely causes and consequences as well as the best strategies for investing profitably.Draws on the experiences of prior credit-driven deleveraging cycles to develop a dynamic framework for investing in an era of economic uncertaintyContains insights on the future of the financial industryProvides fascinating anecdotes from Trahan's time at Bear Stearns prior to its collapse and saleIncludes interactive digital tool for users to determine investment strategies based on personal predictionsIf you intend on succeeding in today's economic environment you can't follow yesterday's investment strategies. The Era of Uncertainty reveals what it will take to make it in such a different market and how you can incorporate new strategies into your everyday investment endeavors.The book comes with an interactive digital tool allowing users to make their own predictions about the economic future and receive asset allocation and sector allocation advice.

Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC


                  Bel Air Investment Advisors (BAIA) develops an asset allocation to meet each client's investment objectives. They consider the client's specific issues and the economic and market environment. The firm employs a longer-term investment approach that seeks to achieve consistent, risk-adjusted after-tax returns over time. BAIA allocates assets across four major categories: equities, fixed-income, alternative investments and cash.Equities make up the growth component of BAIA's portfolios. They invest in a portfolio of equities that is well-diversified by market-cap and variety of domestic and international core, growth and value stocks. Though not limited by sector, the firm tends to invest in the stocks of US large-cap companies in the health technology, electronic technology, technology services and energy minerals sectors. BAIA maintains a very low turnover rate.BAIA's fixed-income investment strategy seeks to provide a predictable, steady cash flow with lower risk of capital loss.The firm's alternative investments include hedge funds, real assets such as energy and real estate and private equity. These investments are generally less liquid than equities or fixed-income, offer returns that are potentially less correlated to the public equity and fixed-income markets and have the potential to achieve higher returns.BAIA uses cash allocations in situations that require high levels of liquidity. Their cash investments include simple money-market funds with attractive yields, floating-rate municipal instruments, discount US agencies and other short-term fixed income securities.
