Michael Kelly is one of the top trial lawyers in the country. He has litigated hundreds of high-profile cases nationally in both state and federal courts, including commercial and other civil disputes, shareholder suits, toxic torts, product liability, environmental, antitrust, Hatch Waxman and other intellectual property cases. He has brought more than hundreds of these cases to trial and argued countless appeals, including over 20 cases before the Delaware Supreme Court. Mr. Kelly is a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. His most recent victory in the Delaware Chancery Court made new law. In Cigna v. Audax, Mr. Kelly brought suit on behalf of Cigna, a preferred Audax stockholder whose shares were extinguished by a merger that closed in February 2014, and secured a declaration permitting it to tender its shares and receive merger consideration without adopting conditions imposed by the buyer. Siding with Cigna, the Court held that these conditions were invalid and that substantial components of the Merger Agreement violated Delaware General Corporation Law. This decision has significant potential ramifications for future mergers under Delaware law.Also in 2014, in the First Circuit, Mr. Kelly served as co-counsel in defense of AstraZeneca's Hatch-Waxman Act settlements with generic drug manufacturers from multiple MDL antitrust class actions. The classes, consisting of end users, distributors and retailers, claimed that AZ's settlements with generic manufacturers over its patented drug Nexium harmed competition by artificially delaying generic entry. It is the first “pay-for-delay” case to reach trial since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in FTC v. Actavis. Pretrial practice and tactics limited the scope of the claims and created what proved to be an insurmountable hurdle on the issue of causation. After six weeks of trial, a Massachusetts jury found that there was no causation between the settlements and no proof that a generic could have entered the market earlier than the date permitted under the settlements. Mr. Kelly was instrumental in devising the strategy of the case and led settlement discussions. A recent landmark case was the Seroquel® litigation, one of the largest pharmaceutical mass tort suits ever. Mr. Kelly served on AstraZeneca’s National Senior Management Team for the case and was lead trial counsel in Delaware. Mr. Kelly obtained summary judgment in the first Seroquel case filed in Delaware (Hopkins v. AstraZeneca) and a sweeping statute of limitations decision (Burrell et al v. AstraZeneca). These decisive victories paved the way to over 28,000 settlements in similar cases, at a fraction of the cost of the settlements of comparable tort cases. Mr. Kelly served as lead negotiator in the settlement negotiations. Mr. Kelly also serves on the national trial team for the In Re Risperdal Products Litigation for Johnson and Johnson. In October—December 2015, Mr. Kelly was lead trial attorney in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas case, Stange v Johnson and Johnson et al, which resulted in the lowest monetary award to date.  Mr. Kelly was also lead defense trial counsel in the In re Metoprolol antitrust litigation, which involved alleged damages in excess of $3 billion. In a 2005 Lanham Act trial, Mr. Kelly won not only a favorable judgment in excess of $100 million, but $12 million in attorney's fees, one of the largest fee awards in Delaware history. Mr. Kelly represents numerous Fortune 100 companies and for many years was the attorney for former boxing heavyweight champion “Smokin’ Joe” Frazier.He has been a leader in the Delaware legal community for decades and currently serves on the State of Delaware Judicial Nominating Commission. Early in his career, he was General Counsel of the Resins Group at Hercules Incorporated, after serving as the company’s chief environmental litigator. Mr. Kelly started out as a trial attorney at the Wilmington firm of Pricket, Jones, during which time he served as Treasurer of the Delaware State Bar Association and cofounded the Defense Counsel of Delaware. A popular speaker for both his trial experience and extensive knowledge of Delaware law, Mr. Kelly lectures on litigation and trial strategy, and has appeared as a legal commentator on live national television and radio. He has testified as an expert at trial and offered legal commentary in Newsweek, Barrons and The Wall Street Journal. He frequently contributes articles to legal publications and is on the faculty of the University of Virginia Law School Trial Advocacy Institute. Mr. Kelly also serves on the boards of numerous charitable organizations. In addition to his role as a trial attorney and commitment to his clients, Mr. Kelly is Chairman of the Firm and serves on McCarter’s Executive Committee and Compensation Committee.He was recognized as a Chambers USA “Leaders in Their Field” lawyer for 2014-2017. Chambers is published by Chambers and Partners. Martindale-Hubbell is published by Internet Brands, Inc.

Welcome To Michael P. Kelly, C.P.A.
It's Nice To Meet You
Tell Me More









Services
Our firm offers tax preparation services, bookkeeping and audit representation (God forbid).  I am also a Registered Investment Adviser and offer financial planning and investment management services under a separate entity: Airgead Clann, LLC. (www.airgeadclann.net). 








Tax Preparation
Preparing your own income tax return can be a task that leaves you with more questions than answers. 
                    According to a study released by the US Government's General Accounting Office, most taxpayers (77% of 71 million taxpayers) believe 
                    they benefited from using a professional tax preparer.
                    
                    Whether we like it or not, today's tax laws are so complicated that filing a relatively simple return can be confusing. 
                    It is just too easy to overlook deductions and credits to which you are entitled. Even if you use a computer software program there's no substitute 
                    for the assistance of an experienced tax professional.






Bookkeeping
As a small business owner you have more important things to do than to keep your own books. 
                    We take care of your books for you, so you can get back to the job of running your business and generating profits!
Each month or quarter we'll do the following things for you:

                                    In staying with the theme of our family business and channeling our 
                                    Irish roots, we chose Airgead Clann which is Gaelic for Money Family.

Our Amazing Team
My firm consists of myself and three staff employees.  
                    My motto is simple:  take care of my clients.  I hate making mistakes, so I have designed systems 
                    to check every work product several times before it leaves my office.  I assign tasks to appropriate 
                    personnel at the lowest billing rates and never create projects only for my benefit.






Michael Kelly
Owner








Your money belongs to you. Don't you ever forget that.
Quoting Arthur Godfrey can best sum up the expression of my tax philosophy:

"I am proud to be a tax paying American -- only I could be just as proud paying half the money."


"For thy sweet love remembered, such wealth brings, that then I scorn to change my place with Kings."

Early life and education[edit]
Kelly was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture and Urban Planning at Princeton University in 1977, and went on to receive a Masters of Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1983; and a Master of Arts in Education from San Francisco State University that same year.
Public Housing Career[edit]
Kelly began his career in the public housing arena as an architect for the San Francisco Housing Authority in 1983. For nearly a decade, Kelly held a series of progressively responsible positions at the authority and was ultimately named its acting executive director—becoming the first registered architect to head a public housing authority in the U.S.
In 1994, Kelly left San Francisco to serve at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a Troubled Agency Recovery Specialist, providing technical assistance to the Transition Team at the Housing Authority of New Orleans. Then in 1995, he was named executive director of the New Orleans housing authority—a post he held until 2000.
In 2000, Kelly assumed leadership of the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA[1]), one of the nation’s largest with a staff of 800 and operating and capital budgets of more than $300 million. DCHA administers 8,000 units of public housing and 12,000 units under the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), providing affordable housing for nearly 10 percent of the District’s population.
In 2010, Kelly resigned from DCHA to become general manager of the New York City Housing Authority. Mr. Kelly served in this position until he was asked to serve as the Administrative Receiver of the Philadelphia Housing Authority by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter.
Kelly took a $60,000 annual pay reduction to return to DCHA as Director of Department of Housing and Community Development in June 2012 after resigning his Philadelphia position over HUD notification by PHA staffers that Kelly was having a consensual affair with a woman he had appointed to a senior staff position and, that despite having little or no credentials for the post, he was approving her for large pay increases.
On January 18, 2013 the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that after two investigative reviews, regarding the financial allegations, the woman, having "two master's degrees and a doctorate in philosophy", was qualified for the promotions she received". Both the Philadelphia Housing Authority Internal Office of Audit and Compliance and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Inspector General, "found no evidence" that Kelly misspent federal government funding.
Mr. Kelly rejoined the NYCHA, again as General Manager - on March 25, 2015. NYCHA administers more than 178,000 apartments with at least 400,000 residents.[2]
Mr. Kelly's wife is a certified nurse-midwife and clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington University medical school in Washington DC. His daughter Rosa, who holds a master's degree in urban planning from The Pratt Institute, is a project manager for the New York City Department of Small Business Services. His son Kevin is an actor, currently living and working in Seattle. He is a 2015 graduate of Brown University His daughter Mikka works in education in San Francisco.
Major Professional Accomplishments[edit]
It has been Kelly’s tenure as Executive Director of the DCHA that has garnered him the most national attention. A March 2008 article in the New York Times,[3] called Kelly’s work “Washington’s Grand Experiment to Rehouse the Poor,” because of a number of large redevelopment projects initiated under his leadership.
Since 1993, the DCHA has received over $182 million in HOPE VI grants[4] from HUD to redevelop properties where aging public housing once stood. These competitive grants were leveraged into more than $1.5 billion with additional public and private resources. Seven HOPE VI projects[5] have been completed or are under construction bringing low-and moderate-income, workforce and market rate housing for rent and purchase to areas across the city.
Kelly stepped up this process in recent years with a number of ambitious HOPE VI developments including the Arthur Capper-Carrollsburg project, which sits at the center of Washington, D.C.’s, Capitol Riverfront neighborhood, an area of major real estate activity in the city.
The redevelopment is the most ambitious HOPE VI project[6] in the country and ultimately will provide approximately 2,100 housing units for purchase and rent including accessible units, as well as office and retail space, a community center and Canal Park.
The development is building a unit for each lost to demolition of the old Capper/Carrollsburg public housing property—a one-to-one replacement that is unique in large cities with tight housing markets.
A number of the DCHA’s HOPE VI communities have won awards of recognition, including the Urban Land Institute Award of Excellence for the DCHA’s Townhomes on Capitol Hill development. The DCHA’s Wheeler Creek Development[7] was awarded the HUD’s Best Practices award in 2000, Best in American Living Design,[8] and the HUD Secretary’s Award for Excellence and the National Association of Homebuilders award in 2002.[9]
Kelly has been described as being in the “public housing vanguard”[10] for putting DCHA on a strong financial footing and creating a new strategic planning process for the authority that takes a corporate approach to management of the organization’s business requirements and opportunities.
For eight consecutive years, DCHA has received unqualified audits from independent auditors. And in 2004 Moody’s Investment Service conducted an independent organizational assessment of DCHA, giving it an AA rating.[11] A second assessment in 2007 resulted in an upgrade to MQ1, Moody’s highest rating for financial and management operations.
The authority also secured an $80 million bond deal to finance modernization of public housing and met the two-year deadline to obligate funds.
Under his leadership, DCHA also established three subsidiaries as well as its own Energy Service Company (ESCO), the first housing authority in the country to do so. The company provides energy services to all of the DCHA properties, savings significant dollars, while making public housing more energy efficient. Among its achievements is the installation of a green roof on one DCHA senior property.[12]
Also under Kelly’s tenure, DCHA implemented the first Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program in the city, which to date has helped nearly 200 renters become first time homeowners[13] . The authority also received a HUD designation[14] of Moving to Work (MTW), one of just of 30 housing authorities selected to participate in this program, which allows DCHA to modify or eliminate HUD rules in order to better serve the local needs of public housing residents and voucher participants.
Kelly also led the creation of the DCHA’s customer-centered work environment through staff training, performance incentives and the design and implementation of a customer service structure. This initiative included the establishment a state-of-the-art Customer Call Center, which now provides higher levels of efficiency in responding to the needs of residents, stakeholders and the public.
In 2008, Kenneth Donohue, Inspector General for HUD, presented the Inspector General’s Service Award to Kelly.[15] . Donohue stated that Kelly has headed the authority since it emerged from court-ordered receivership in 2000 and, “Today, it’s one of the best programs in the nation.” The national award represents “excellence in public service and accountability to the people we serve.”
On October 1, 2009, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg named Kelly to serve as General Manager of the city’s public housing agency, just one day after Kelly’s last day at work in D.C.
As General Manager of the New York City Housing Authority, the largest public housing authority in North America, he manages 178,000 apartments in 338 developments. Another 640,000 New York City residents are served by the Section 8 housing voucher program.
Kelly announced his resignation from DCHA Sept. 14, allowing his contract to expire at the end of the month. His departure ends a nine-year reign in which he attracted seven federal HOPE VI grants for development of mixed-income housing, second most of any jurisdiction in the nation, and rehabbed or tore down some of the country’s most dilapidated housing projects.
Academic Appointments[edit]
Kelly currently holds a number of academic appointments including assistant adjunct professor in the School of Architecture and Engineering at Howard University in Washington, D.C. He also serves as a Preceptor for the Project 55 Fellowship program at Princeton University, mentoring graduates with an interest in public service through a year-long fellowship. From 1997 to 2000, Kelly served as the Harvey-Wadsworth Professor of Urban Affairs at Tulane University, as well as a Visiting Lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley School of Architecture during the early 1980s. He received teaching credentials in New Jersey and California, and graduated from Princeton's program in Teaching Preparation.
Professional Leadership Positions[edit]
Kelly is the President of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, a Washington, D.C., based national non-profit organization whose members represent large metropolitan areas in the U.S. The council works to preserve and improve public and affordable housing through advocacy, research, policy analysis and public education.[16]
He also serves as vice chairman of the National Organization of African Americans in Housing[17] and sits on the boards of the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare; District of Columbia Interagency Commission on Homelessness; and the Canal Park Development Association. In 2009, he became Chairman of the Board of City Year, DC.[18]
Kelly is a member of the American Institute of Architects; the National Housing Conference; the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials; the American Planning Association; the American Institute of Certified Planners; and is the US Green Building Council's Lead Green Associate.

Early life and education[edit]
Kelly was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture and Urban Planning at Princeton University in 1977, and went on to receive a Masters of Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1983; and a Master of Arts in Education from San Francisco State University that same year.
Public Housing Career[edit]
Kelly began his career in the public housing arena as an architect for the San Francisco Housing Authority in 1983. For nearly a decade, Kelly held a series of progressively responsible positions at the authority and was ultimately named its acting executive director—becoming the first registered architect to head a public housing authority in the U.S.
In 1994, Kelly left San Francisco to serve at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a Troubled Agency Recovery Specialist, providing technical assistance to the Transition Team at the Housing Authority of New Orleans. Then in 1995, he was named executive director of the New Orleans housing authority—a post he held until 2000.
In 2000, Kelly assumed leadership of the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA[1]), one of the nation’s largest with a staff of 800 and operating and capital budgets of more than $300 million. DCHA administers 8,000 units of public housing and 12,000 units under the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), providing affordable housing for nearly 10 percent of the District’s population.
In 2010, Kelly resigned from DCHA to become general manager of the New York City Housing Authority. Mr. Kelly served in this position until he was asked to serve as the Administrative Receiver of the Philadelphia Housing Authority by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter.
Kelly took a $60,000 annual pay reduction to return to DCHA as Director of Department of Housing and Community Development in June 2012 after resigning his Philadelphia position over HUD notification by PHA staffers that Kelly was having a consensual affair with a woman he had appointed to a senior staff position and, that despite having little or no credentials for the post, he was approving her for large pay increases.
On January 18, 2013 the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that after two investigative reviews, regarding the financial allegations, the woman, having "two master's degrees and a doctorate in philosophy", was qualified for the promotions she received". Both the Philadelphia Housing Authority Internal Office of Audit and Compliance and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Inspector General, "found no evidence" that Kelly misspent federal government funding.
Mr. Kelly rejoined the NYCHA, again as General Manager - on March 25, 2015. NYCHA administers more than 178,000 apartments with at least 400,000 residents.[2]
Mr. Kelly's wife is a certified nurse-midwife and clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington University medical school in Washington DC. His daughter Rosa, who holds a master's degree in urban planning from The Pratt Institute, is a project manager for the New York City Department of Small Business Services. His son Kevin is an actor, currently living and working in Seattle. He is a 2015 graduate of Brown University His daughter Mikka works in education in San Francisco.
Major Professional Accomplishments[edit]
It has been Kelly’s tenure as Executive Director of the DCHA that has garnered him the most national attention. A March 2008 article in the New York Times,[3] called Kelly’s work “Washington’s Grand Experiment to Rehouse the Poor,” because of a number of large redevelopment projects initiated under his leadership.
Since 1993, the DCHA has received over $182 million in HOPE VI grants[4] from HUD to redevelop properties where aging public housing once stood. These competitive grants were leveraged into more than $1.5 billion with additional public and private resources. Seven HOPE VI projects[5] have been completed or are under construction bringing low-and moderate-income, workforce and market rate housing for rent and purchase to areas across the city.
Kelly stepped up this process in recent years with a number of ambitious HOPE VI developments including the Arthur Capper-Carrollsburg project, which sits at the center of Washington, D.C.’s, Capitol Riverfront neighborhood, an area of major real estate activity in the city.
The redevelopment is the most ambitious HOPE VI project[6] in the country and ultimately will provide approximately 2,100 housing units for purchase and rent including accessible units, as well as office and retail space, a community center and Canal Park.
The development is building a unit for each lost to demolition of the old Capper/Carrollsburg public housing property—a one-to-one replacement that is unique in large cities with tight housing markets.
A number of the DCHA’s HOPE VI communities have won awards of recognition, including the Urban Land Institute Award of Excellence for the DCHA’s Townhomes on Capitol Hill development. The DCHA’s Wheeler Creek Development[7] was awarded the HUD’s Best Practices award in 2000, Best in American Living Design,[8] and the HUD Secretary’s Award for Excellence and the National Association of Homebuilders award in 2002.[9]
Kelly has been described as being in the “public housing vanguard”[10] for putting DCHA on a strong financial footing and creating a new strategic planning process for the authority that takes a corporate approach to management of the organization’s business requirements and opportunities.
For eight consecutive years, DCHA has received unqualified audits from independent auditors. And in 2004 Moody’s Investment Service conducted an independent organizational assessment of DCHA, giving it an AA rating.[11] A second assessment in 2007 resulted in an upgrade to MQ1, Moody’s highest rating for financial and management operations.
The authority also secured an $80 million bond deal to finance modernization of public housing and met the two-year deadline to obligate funds.
Under his leadership, DCHA also established three subsidiaries as well as its own Energy Service Company (ESCO), the first housing authority in the country to do so. The company provides energy services to all of the DCHA properties, savings significant dollars, while making public housing more energy efficient. Among its achievements is the installation of a green roof on one DCHA senior property.[12]
Also under Kelly’s tenure, DCHA implemented the first Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program in the city, which to date has helped nearly 200 renters become first time homeowners[13] . The authority also received a HUD designation[14] of Moving to Work (MTW), one of just of 30 housing authorities selected to participate in this program, which allows DCHA to modify or eliminate HUD rules in order to better serve the local needs of public housing residents and voucher participants.
Kelly also led the creation of the DCHA’s customer-centered work environment through staff training, performance incentives and the design and implementation of a customer service structure. This initiative included the establishment a state-of-the-art Customer Call Center, which now provides higher levels of efficiency in responding to the needs of residents, stakeholders and the public.
In 2008, Kenneth Donohue, Inspector General for HUD, presented the Inspector General’s Service Award to Kelly.[15] . Donohue stated that Kelly has headed the authority since it emerged from court-ordered receivership in 2000 and, “Today, it’s one of the best programs in the nation.” The national award represents “excellence in public service and accountability to the people we serve.”
On October 1, 2009, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg named Kelly to serve as General Manager of the city’s public housing agency, just one day after Kelly’s last day at work in D.C.
As General Manager of the New York City Housing Authority, the largest public housing authority in North America, he manages 178,000 apartments in 338 developments. Another 640,000 New York City residents are served by the Section 8 housing voucher program.
Kelly announced his resignation from DCHA Sept. 14, allowing his contract to expire at the end of the month. His departure ends a nine-year reign in which he attracted seven federal HOPE VI grants for development of mixed-income housing, second most of any jurisdiction in the nation, and rehabbed or tore down some of the country’s most dilapidated housing projects.

He also serves as a Preceptor for the Project 55 Fellowship program at Princeton University, mentoring graduates with an interest in public service through a year-long fellowship.

He received teaching credentials in New Jersey and California, and graduated from Princeton's program in Teaching Preparation.

In 2009, he became Chairman of the Board of City Year, DC.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Kelly was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture and Urban Planning at Princeton University in 1977, and went on to receive a Masters of Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1983; and a Master of Arts in Education from San Francisco State University that same year.
Public Housing Career[edit]
Kelly began his career in the public housing arena as an architect for the San Francisco Housing Authority in 1983. For nearly a decade, Kelly held a series of progressively responsible positions at the authority and was ultimately named its acting executive director—becoming the first registered architect to head a public housing authority in the U.S.
In 1994, Kelly left San Francisco to serve at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a Troubled Agency Recovery Specialist, providing technical assistance to the Transition Team at the Housing Authority of New Orleans. Then in 1995, he was named executive director of the New Orleans housing authority—a post he held until 2000.
In 2000, Kelly assumed leadership of the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA[1]), one of the nation’s largest with a staff of 800 and operating and capital budgets of more than $300 million. DCHA administers 8,000 units of public housing and 12,000 units under the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), providing affordable housing for nearly 10 percent of the District’s population.
In 2010, Kelly resigned from DCHA to become general manager of the New York City Housing Authority. Mr. Kelly served in this position until he was asked to serve as the Administrative Receiver of the Philadelphia Housing Authority by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter.
Kelly took a $60,000 annual pay reduction to return to DCHA as Director of Department of Housing and Community Development in June 2012 after resigning his Philadelphia position over HUD notification by PHA staffers that Kelly was having a consensual affair with a woman he had appointed to a senior staff position and, that despite having little or no credentials for the post, he was approving her for large pay increases.
On January 18, 2013 the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that after two investigative reviews, regarding the financial allegations, the woman, having "two master's degrees and a doctorate in philosophy", was qualified for the promotions she received". Both the Philadelphia Housing Authority Internal Office of Audit and Compliance and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Inspector General, "found no evidence" that Kelly misspent federal government funding.
Mr. Kelly rejoined the NYCHA, again as General Manager - on March 25, 2015. NYCHA administers more than 178,000 apartments with at least 400,000 residents.[2]
Mr. Kelly's wife is a certified nurse-midwife and clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington University medical school in Washington DC. His daughter Rosa, who holds a master's degree in urban planning from The Pratt Institute, is a project manager for the New York City Department of Small Business Services. His son Kevin is an actor, currently living and working in Seattle. He is a 2015 graduate of Brown University His daughter Mikka works in education in San Francisco.
Major Professional Accomplishments[edit]
It has been Kelly’s tenure as Executive Director of the DCHA that has garnered him the most national attention. A March 2008 article in the New York Times,[3] called Kelly’s work “Washington’s Grand Experiment to Rehouse the Poor,” because of a number of large redevelopment projects initiated under his leadership.
Since 1993, the DCHA has received over $182 million in HOPE VI grants[4] from HUD to redevelop properties where aging public housing once stood. These competitive grants were leveraged into more than $1.5 billion with additional public and private resources. Seven HOPE VI projects[5] have been completed or are under construction bringing low-and moderate-income, workforce and market rate housing for rent and purchase to areas across the city.
Kelly stepped up this process in recent years with a number of ambitious HOPE VI developments including the Arthur Capper-Carrollsburg project, which sits at the center of Washington, D.C.’s, Capitol Riverfront neighborhood, an area of major real estate activity in the city.
The redevelopment is the most ambitious HOPE VI project[6] in the country and ultimately will provide approximately 2,100 housing units for purchase and rent including accessible units, as well as office and retail space, a community center and Canal Park.
The development is building a unit for each lost to demolition of the old Capper/Carrollsburg public housing property—a one-to-one replacement that is unique in large cities with tight housing markets.
A number of the DCHA’s HOPE VI communities have won awards of recognition, including the Urban Land Institute Award of Excellence for the DCHA’s Townhomes on Capitol Hill development. The DCHA’s Wheeler Creek Development[7] was awarded the HUD’s Best Practices award in 2000, Best in American Living Design,[8] and the HUD Secretary’s Award for Excellence and the National Association of Homebuilders award in 2002.[9]
Kelly has been described as being in the “public housing vanguard”[10] for putting DCHA on a strong financial footing and creating a new strategic planning process for the authority that takes a corporate approach to management of the organization’s business requirements and opportunities.
For eight consecutive years, DCHA has received unqualified audits from independent auditors. And in 2004 Moody’s Investment Service conducted an independent organizational assessment of DCHA, giving it an AA rating.[11] A second assessment in 2007 resulted in an upgrade to MQ1, Moody’s highest rating for financial and management operations.
The authority also secured an $80 million bond deal to finance modernization of public housing and met the two-year deadline to obligate funds.
Under his leadership, DCHA also established three subsidiaries as well as its own Energy Service Company (ESCO), the first housing authority in the country to do so. The company provides energy services to all of the DCHA properties, savings significant dollars, while making public housing more energy efficient. Among its achievements is the installation of a green roof on one DCHA senior property.[12]
Also under Kelly’s tenure, DCHA implemented the first Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program in the city, which to date has helped nearly 200 renters become first time homeowners[13] . The authority also received a HUD designation[14] of Moving to Work (MTW), one of just of 30 housing authorities selected to participate in this program, which allows DCHA to modify or eliminate HUD rules in order to better serve the local needs of public housing residents and voucher participants.
Kelly also led the creation of the DCHA’s customer-centered work environment through staff training, performance incentives and the design and implementation of a customer service structure. This initiative included the establishment a state-of-the-art Customer Call Center, which now provides higher levels of efficiency in responding to the needs of residents, stakeholders and the public.
In 2008, Kenneth Donohue, Inspector General for HUD, presented the Inspector General’s Service Award to Kelly.[15] . Donohue stated that Kelly has headed the authority since it emerged from court-ordered receivership in 2000 and, “Today, it’s one of the best programs in the nation.” The national award represents “excellence in public service and accountability to the people we serve.”
On October 1, 2009, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg named Kelly to serve as General Manager of the city’s public housing agency, just one day after Kelly’s last day at work in D.C.
As General Manager of the New York City Housing Authority, the largest public housing authority in North America, he manages 178,000 apartments in 338 developments. Another 640,000 New York City residents are served by the Section 8 housing voucher program.
Kelly announced his resignation from DCHA Sept. 14, allowing his contract to expire at the end of the month. His departure ends a nine-year reign in which he attracted seven federal HOPE VI grants for development of mixed-income housing, second most of any jurisdiction in the nation, and rehabbed or tore down some of the country’s most dilapidated housing projects.
Academic Appointments[edit]
Kelly currently holds a number of academic appointments including assistant adjunct professor in the School of Architecture and Engineering at Howard University in Washington, D.C. He also serves as a Preceptor for the Project 55 Fellowship program at Princeton University, mentoring graduates with an interest in public service through a year-long fellowship. From 1997 to 2000, Kelly served as the Harvey-Wadsworth Professor of Urban Affairs at Tulane University, as well as a Visiting Lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley School of Architecture during the early 1980s. He received teaching credentials in New Jersey and California, and graduated from Princeton's program in Teaching Preparation.
Professional Leadership Positions[edit]
Kelly is the President of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, a Washington, D.C., based national non-profit organization whose members represent large metropolitan areas in the U.S. The council works to preserve and improve public and affordable housing through advocacy, research, policy analysis and public education.[16]
He also serves as vice chairman of the National Organization of African Americans in Housing[17] and sits on the boards of the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare; District of Columbia Interagency Commission on Homelessness; and the Canal Park Development Association. In 2009, he became Chairman of the Board of City Year, DC.[18]
Kelly is a member of the American Institute of Architects; the National Housing Conference; the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials; the American Planning Association; the American Institute of Certified Planners; and is the US Green Building Council's Lead Green Associate.

Kelly Ripa Drops 'Contract Negotiations' Zinger on Live; Exiting Michael Strahan Unamused?


				By 
				
Michael Slezak / 				

					April 28 2016, 7:43 AM PDT				















202










Did a screaming, hairy armadillo just amble into the middle of reported tensions between Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan?
Toward the end of Thursday’s Live With Kelly and Michael, Mutual of Omaha’s Peter Gros brought out the mammal as part of an animal segment, noting its size and lack of teeth forces it to scare off predators by shrieking. “He’s about to scare me away!” chimed in Strahan, as the creature continued its noisy protests.

RELATEDKelly Ripa Returns to Live, Addresses Strahan Exit Dustup: ‘Our National Nightmare Is Over’ — Watch Video

Seconds later, Ripa declared that “something just flew off of [the armadillo] and into my mouth.” When Gros asked if she’d like a napkin, Ripa exclaimed, “I want to take him into contract negotiations with me!” before breaking up with laughter.







“He always gets his way with a predator!” joked Gros, in response.
Strahan, for his part, didn’t even crack a smile, then scrunched up his nose as he and Ripa caught a whiff of the pungent beast. “He’s got a nice smell to him,” Strahan observed sarcastically.
Also smelling peculiar? Over the past two days, neither Strahan nor Ripa has uttered a word on air about Strahan’s significantly moved-up exit date.

RELATEDKelly Ripa, Michael Strahan Not Attending Daytime Emmy Awards

Indeed, when ABC first announced on April 19 that Strahan would jump ship from Live to Good Morning America, it was reported that he would continue on with the former program through the end of summer. Shortly after the Tuesday, April 26 Live telecast, however, word surfaced that Strahan’s last appearance on the show would be May 13.
Ripa, blindsided by news of Strahan’s exit, called in sick on April 20, then took some previously scheduled vacation right after, only returning to the show on April 26, when she addressed the controversy head-on. “I needed a couple of days to gather my thoughts. After 26 years with this company, I earned the right,” she said, adding, “What transpired over the course of a few days has been extraordinary, in the sense that it started a much larger conversation about communication and consideration and most importantly respect in the workplace. And since we’re being honest, I don’t consider this just a workplace. This is my second home.”

RELATEDMichael Strahan Poised to Make Very Premature Exit From Live

Ripa at the time added she was “thrilled” for Strahan, and had been assured by ABC brass that “Live is a priority” — an important factor considering that Ripa was reportedly vexed by rumors that ABC was looking to add an extra hour to GMA, which would bump Live from its 9am perch on most ABC stations.
Strahan will continue to appear on GMA throughout the summer, where he has made regular appearances since 2014. He will also serve as host of ABC’s upcoming $100,000 Pyramid reboot (debuting Sunday, June 26 at 9/8c).
Additionally, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Ryan Seacrest is being eyed as a possible replacement for Strahan in the wake of the American Idol host re-upping with ABC to host four more years of New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.
Did you catch ArmadilloGate on Live? Are you ready for Strahan to make the leap to GMA and for Ripa to move on with a new co-host? Sound off below!

Huh, this sure is working out well for keeping the focus on “Live!”  Methinks this is a part of ABC/Kelly Ripa’s plan to help out with ratings at Live since they’re clearly in the news more because of this.  Gives Ripa more leverage when she is, in fact, negotiating her contract too…

I hope that ABC is smarter than to negotiate her contract. She is not the only reason LIVE does so well in the ratings. This lady is a farce and when the ratings drop who is to blame? Ripa is a spoiled brat and now ABC needs to replace 2 people

Considering she has been constant I don’t think your statement is valid.  STOP watching since you clearly do not like her.  Me thinks some just like to complain behind their key boards.

I agree: Kelly ‘used to be more down-to-earth and less self-centered, less self absorbed, she sure has a case of the big-head!
At 20-million-per-year for five-hours a week of conversing and small talk. Kelly needs to ‘face reality: LIVE With Kelly is a team effort, not just Kelly (LIVE has been on air for 30 years, Kelly has only been there for 15  years – share some credit with Regis!

They need to find someone else. There are way too many people in Hollywood and New York that are much more talented than her. She is benefiting from what was built by Regis and Kathie Lee. Give me a break..20 million a year and all her demands??Her and her husband act like she is a God or Royalty. I am done with this show and them. Goodbye!

The show is a trainwreck … Kelly can’t make eye contact, Strahan is uncomfortable, it’s all very awkward to watch.  The banter is phony, the laughter is phony, the directed applause from the audience is phony … they obviously cannot stand one another.  Torturous.  They photoshopped Kelly’s eyes onto a hedgehog and she didn’t look amused at all.  What a waste of time this show is. Makes you realize there really isn’t a point to it at all.

Can’t be that nice, maybe you should check with his ex-wife.  He probably should leave before May 13 because I get the impression he doesn’t want to be there.  As far as Ryan maybe in the running – don’t think so.  I do not see him moving to NY to do a morning especially with everything else he has going on.  My solution to all you haters stop watching if it is so painful.

Kelly’s behavior during this whole thing has been nothing short of unprofessional and insufferable.   If she is unhappy, everyone else will be.  If she doesn’t like you, you will know it.  Just ask Clay Aiken.  She needs someone more superficial and more vacuous to play with on a daily basis, like Anderson Cooper or Andy Cohen or Ryan Seacrest.  Strahan is charming and did a great job, but he’s a sports guy and was out of  his element.  He needs to escape this prissy, hissy-fit playground immediately and work with some adults.

Totally correct, the producers and brass at ABC have helped enable this driveling idiot to think what she’s doing for a job is just simply crucial to the world and everyone’s life!  She has lost perspective and is too busy looking at herself in the monitors every four seconds and bragging about another trip or buying something her ill-gotten  gains has given her to just stop and realize what she’s really contributing.  Disney should realize there needs to be no more $ given to her, she’s totally addicted to talking about herself…that should be their leverage, she’d lose it if someone didn’t want to hear what she had to say!  Why would Anderson Cooper give up a respectable gig to sit second chair to this vacuous nitwit?  She just wants a co-host that won’t challenge her image and will only talk about HER life, not their own. Cancel the show.

Mary, Kelly is being unprofessional and she is harassing Mr. Strahan. Mentioning personal information in regards to his divorce on national television during a moment in which he is departing from the show. Extremely distasteful.  I understand she is upset but, there is a time and a place. Double standard between men and women. Mary, Kelly doesn’t get a pass on this one.

Good advice for Anderson Cooper.  Way too smart to sit next to her.  I use to like her years ago, but you are correct.  It’s all about her, or her kids or her husband.  Who needs to watch that everyday.  Today when it came on, I went to Today show.

I agree, the Today Show has really stepped it up: fresh and funny, they added in Carson Daly, Carson’s wife with lifestyle /cooking segments, Willie Geist and I just heard today: Billy Bush from Access Hollywood is jumping ship for TODAY – he’s a great addition, very funny, a good interviewer (he Listens!) and, unlike Kelly ‘the Diva,’ Billy doesn’t insert ‘himself’  into the interview.

Not a Strahan fan, especially with the latest drama-he should exit sooner rather than later. ABC execs have handled this whole thing poorly. Ryan Seacrest or Anderson Cooper would work well as co-hosts. Either way, I think the show will be an improvement. I may actually start watching again.

Not a Strahan fan either. He’s a football guy and nothing else. When he came on, they began “reading” the current events. I missed the old way where Regis & Kelly, or Kathie Lee, would just talk about what they did the previous night. No reading off papers or cue cards. I stopprd watching when when Michael came on..To me, he was boring, just like when her husband came on. As long as Gelman doesn’t completely run the show, Kelly will be fine.

kelly has an inflated ego.  She would be nothing without Regis’s start.  Now she has totally shut him out and she thinks she is the queen bee!  I am tired of her big ego, her wonderful family stories and trips, etc. Half the time she doesn’t even know how to pronounce some places and things.   Good wishes to Michael.

A person can help you get a job but it is up to the individual to maintain it. Michael is very charismatic and brings life to that show and it comes across genuine. At the end of the day no job is secure. She is paid to do a job and she needs to suit up and show up. Who calls out their bosses? Especially on television? She signed a contract to do her job. As long as the check clears, it should not matter who leaves and who stays. Period.

I agree with what pretty much has been said. My main thing i sMichael Strahan is very likeable. Kelly Ripa has lost her shine. She has become a diva and unfortunately not very likeable. I don’t watch because of her, When she and Mark are on together it is very awkward. Even though they are married who cares what thei rkids did  and what not. I am happy for Michael and I hope he does well at GMA.

When she first started on the show I really liked her and found her refreshing. I think her success must have gone to her head. I quit watching several years ago. Maybe no one other than Regis can stay refreshing after that many years. I don’t know.







 Mary says: 

			April 28, 2016 at 12:26 PM 
His point was Regis was not the reason she is successful.  She has more than put her time and skills into this show, she has maintain it.  A person with SELF ESTEEM calls out the bosses when they clearly are in the wrong.  It is okay to stand up for yourself and not be a doormat.  If you and many others cannot comprehend that then clearly you are the one with issues.

I have stopped watching the show for awhile now, mainly because Regis left. I’m not sure exactly what kind of preparation it takes to do the job that Kelly does, however in my opinion she is paid far more than her education or experience deserves! She is not an investigative reporter nor a news broadcast anchor! She does not risk her life for others like the police or firemen, and they make a fraction of what Kelly and other celebrities make! I would rather see the police and firemen make her salary and she make theirs! She seems to be very spoiled and jealous!

Cohost doesnt have to be male.  Abc paired Robin Roberts and Diane Sawyer on GMA for years and NBC has Hoda &  KLG.  The shows audience is female but no doubt KR will have to give approval if she stays past next year.  If ABC really wants to keep the show going, hiring one of her friends not might be a great idea.  They want to avoid replacing both hosts at once since that makes it more difficult. Ripa may have shot herself in the foot but I think most women are still Dan’s despite what a few posters here  claim

i think Kelly would feel threatened by having another woman co-host  , she is very spoiled and has turned into a brat. I have been watching this show since Regis was on, he was the funny one. I tried to find the humor of what Kelly said but she always has a dry sense of humor. I really think she needs to practice what she preaches, respect in the work place. She certainly likes to interrupt people while they are talking. I did enjoy watching her on the soap show  however i did stop watching “Live” after Mr. Strahan left, good luck and best wishes to him.

You people are too funny.  Having worked in daytime talk & with celebrities, they’re all pretty much divas &  divos. Most of them are nothing off camera than on camera.  None of us know what really went on or was said.  Abc is probably happier that Kelly took a day off to cool down vs say something on live TV that they all would have regretted (see Star Jones).  Let it go.  If you don’t like the show, don’t watch.  These jobs aren’t like normal jobs.  Yes there r huge egos when people are compensated and treated like celebrities are.  They’re the bread butter… But also realize hundred people not making millions make their livelihood working on the show 15

It is hard t look at someone who looks like they are starving themselves. She is not funny! They need two new hosts! There are workers in this country who are really bullied, are sexually harassed,lose their jobs because of stupid office politics and she is making a big tissy fit over her co worker leaving!!!

A lot of you don’t like Kelly, and some don’t like Michael.  You know who I didn’t like?  Regis and Kathy Lee!  I was never so glad to see Kelly come on that show when Kathy Lee left!  And there was just something about Regis that sent chills up my spine, like fingernails on a chalk board!  I thought Michael has always done an excellent job, as has Kelly.  They keep me laughing, unlike Kathy Lee as she talked about her son Cody while Regis rolled his eyes.  If Strahan’s departure is coming sooner than September, don’t let the door hit ya in the backside, Michael.  I think Ryan Secrest  would be an excellent choice!  How about it, ladies?

Ironically, here in Brevard County, FL we see this show from 9 to 10 am on NBC in the middle of the Today show…… Today runs 7 to 9, then Kelly & Michael, then the last segment of Today…. not sure what that’s all about!  I can understand Kelly being upset, but the more professional she acts now, the better the numbers during contract renegotiation and it’s been reported that while she makes a very, very good chunk of change each year, she also spends a very, very, very good chunk of change……….

I work during the day, but on the occasions I have been home, I can tolerate Kelly Ripa most of the time, and even enjoy her humor and banter on other occasions, I really have enjoyed watching the show with Michael Strahan on it as co-host.  Kelly’s reaction to Strahan’s decision to leave the show has been over the top childish – acting like a middle-schooler whose boyfriend has decided to “date” another girl. It has really turned me off to the show and I doubt I will watch it at all once Strahan leaves.

If she’d come out and kissed Strahan on the cheek, some buffoon would have found some way to criticize her. She’s in a no-win situation and ABC put her there. With what ABC did, I’d want the little devil creature on my side for negotiations, too.

SINCE ARMADILLO’S CARRY ‘LIVE LEPROSY’ GERM IN THEIR SKIN & CLAWS…… SHE GOT IT IN HER MOUTH…COOL!!!!!!!!!! Bet New Contract with ‘Half a Face’ Kelly Ripa would be a slam dunk.

This ding bat should be glad she even has a job. The only negotiations I would be in with her is how much she would be paying me to stay. She will never get a job anywhere else except on Fox & Friends or Fox News. They are the only other network that hires ding bat puppets. She would fit right in with them

Move on Kelly and get a new Cohost.  I have never liked Strahan and wondered why he was chosen in the first place.  You can do better.

Media is over blowing this whole drama for ratings mostly.
Her first day back you could see the mood between thetwo in her face.
How dare you its all about me I am the star of this show.
Yea right…..

I agree.  Anyone but Seacrest!  Kelly has been a class act.  All she did was demand the respect that she deserves as someone whose name is on the show.  If the tables were turned, the male cohost would have never been treated that way.  If she did not demand the respect of the network, they would think what they did to her was fine and proceed to do it again and again.  She has made the network a lot of money over they years.  She has been loyal.  They simply needed to return the favor.  
It is really pretty simple to the haters out there, if you don’t like Kelly, don’t watch.  She has proven to be very adept at her job over the past fifteen years and has largely carried the show.  If ABC decided to cancel the show, she would have no problem launching a show elsewhere.

I’d fire her. She was nothing without Regis, who gave her Live, and, she has never thanked him publicly. She also doesn’t talk to Regis and wants nothing to do with anyone anti-diva. This little blond talentless bimbo is a joke. I’d fire her in a ‘New York Minute’. Give the gig to Andrews, she at least was genuinely funny.

 Mary says:

It is obvious you don’t know what your talking about because Regis has been gone for quite some time and the show is still going.  Your jealousy is showing, time to move on and get a life.

Gay people are humans.  Some have personality that would help a TV Show.  Many have great jobs and life.  Sad really that in this day and age one judges someone because of their sexuality.   Why are you on this site when many of the editors are gay?
Please get educated or refrain from making statements like that.

Kelly has been on ABC for 25 years.  She deserves more respect.  If she were leaving the show instead of Michael, I am sure it would have been handled differently.  She is a very good interviewer and is a strong, independent women.  Most of your comments are so critical.  I bet you could not do her job nearly as well if you had here qualifications.

So many Kelly bashers on the boards.  If you hate her so much why spend so much time talking about her.  I think she is great at her job.  I hope she stays.  It’s funny people talk about the tension between her and Michael but I’ve watched the last two shows, not today’s yet, and found them to be charming as usual.  They seemed to interact just fine.  People who have been in the audience say she is someone who comes out to personally greet audience members (yeah that’s really diva like) and talk with them.  I think it’s sad she’s under fire.  So much negativity these days.

Why would you want a hundred people to lose their job?  Why would a network cancel a popular & profitable show in an Era where it’s very difficult to launch a new one.  The shows been on for three decades and has been renewed thru 2020.  Turn the channel if you don’t like it but don’t understand all the anger & vitriol.  Its a stupid talk show.. It shouldn’t affect your life

I agree with the majority of  people on here. But Michael should have told her about him leaving the show. I would feel betrayed also. I don’t think she handled it very well, and shame on her. She is treating everyone like they are responsible for her problems. I am sure behind scenes she is not being nice to anyone. I hope she gets herself put back together for the sake of the audience and the show.

He did tell her.  And he told her months before he was scheduled to leave.  She doesn’t write his check. The CEO of Disney and the head of ABC make those decisions. He basically got a promotion /transfer. He couldn’t say anything until a deal was signed.  Its not like he’s going to another company to start a competing show like Joan Rivers did to Johnny Carson back in the day.  I don’t know what people wanted from him.  He was supposed to tell her he’s negotiating before it was a deal?  He would have lost his job. Why aren’t we hearing about Gelman being angry.  Some wonder if Kelly has a history of not handling these things well as Regis also didn’t tell her in advance.. Plus she was already not happy about Strahan doing GMA.  If she really didn’t like working with him she should be happy.  One of the main reasons for her freak out was fear this was a clear sign ABC would expand GMA to the 9am hour

It was pretty rotten of Michael Strayhan to handle the situation the way he did. He owes Kelly more loyalty than that considering what she did for him getting him on the show in the first place. In my estimation it has cost Michael Strayhan a great deal as far as my perception of him.

 Ms Faye says:

She may have helped to get Michael on the show but she did not pay his salary! Apparently the Execs liked what they saw in him and thought he could handle more to help GMA! They went to him, so what was he going to say, “no”? I think not! He has apologized numerous times to Kelly and was sincerely  genuine in his welcoming her back to the show.I watch this show everyday and I have observed Michael talking and trying to laugh with Kelly before this controversy began but her smile sometimes was short and abrupt. Whenever she had a guest on to fill in for Michael, she would grin from ear to ear with the guest. I love them both but I hope she is happy with her new  co-host and I wish Michael much success and happiness! Don’t understand why she is angry at Michael for the decisions made by the the Powers-that-be, but they both will be fine! Blessings to both of them!

Michael is suppose to look out for himself…..Kelly isn’t coming off as the nice girl she’s been pretending to be all of this time!!! Michael isn’t her man…..he’s her co-host….remember!!!
