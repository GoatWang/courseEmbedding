Improving Efficiency


Improving Efficiency
We focus on reducing miles-per-gallon and miles driven
Our fleet covers millions of miles a year so we focus on improving efficiency by reducing our diesel fuel usage on a relative basis. We have installed tools and systems to monitor idle time and to track performance by driver in order to improve fuel efficiency. We also work to reduce the amount of miles we drive by implementing efficient routing practices and focusing on improving trailer utilization.  Finally, we are constantly looking at the specifications of our tractors and trailers to improve aerodynamics to further improve the efficiency of our equipment.





Fighting Hunger In America


Fighting Hunger In America
Donating 1 million pounds of food annually
As a proud sponsor of Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger relief organization, we donate more than a million pounds of food annually to help fight hunger. We also support local food banks through product donations, food drives, volunteerism, board memberships and financial donations. Our associates volunteer their time working in warehouses, conducting food drives and raising funds. We encourage our experts to share their knowledge about food and distribution so we can help build better processes and efficiencies for feeding the hungry. 





Recycling and Reducing Energy Use


Recycling and Reducing Energy Use
Working to minimize our carbon footprint
We know reducing electrical energy use in our facilities is important. By installing LED lights in our warehouses, we reduced the amount of energy used for lighting by 40%. We also use hi-tech energy management systems to monitor and adjust our energy usage during peak periods.
We recycle paper, glass and aluminum in our administrative facilities and in our warehouses we recycle cardboard, pallets, corrugate and stretch wrap. We also recycle the water that's used to clean our trucks.



 



 
 







Seeking New Ways To Be Sustainable
Our Performance Foodservice – NorthCenter operating company in Augusta, Maine, is powered 100% by wind through Renewable Energy Credits and partners with the EPA’s SmartWay program to reduce the environmental impact of its truck fleet.

More Than 100 Years Of Foodservice Excellence
We are established experts who evolve with the times
Our roots go back to 1885 when James Capers began peddling groceries for a wholesaler in Richmond, Va. His business grew into Pocahontas Foods, which distributed branded products to restaurants and foodservice outlets across the United States.

We continued to grow and evolve through the mid-1980’s when our leaders had a vision for a new company that would bring together a network of distributors with the corporate support to become an industry giant. Performance Food Group was born in 1987. Today we have three divisions—Performance Foodservice, Vistar and PFG Customized—each of which focuses on delivering delicious food and excelling at customer service.




Change is Our Competitive Advantage 
A Long History of Reinvention 
Over the years we have listened to our customers and transformed to better support their needs. Each division has its own success story, but they all carry the same theme—adaptation. We don’t just show our customers what’s happening today, we show them what’s coming next.
