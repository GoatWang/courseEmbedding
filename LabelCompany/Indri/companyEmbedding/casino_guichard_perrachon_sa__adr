How To Invest In Robotics: The Non-Obvious Way - Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ADR (OTCMKTS:CGUSY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»How To Invest In Robotics: The Non-Obvious WayOct.21.16 | About: Casino Guichard (CGUSY) Bram de Haas Deep Value, special situations, long-term horizonMarketplaceThe Black Swan PortfolioSummaryRobots are on the rise.What industries/jobs will be most affected?How can investors position themselves to profit, protect or insure against jobs becoming obsolete.Reading Too Different For Comfort by Louis-Vincent Gave I came across an interesting paragraph making sense of what type of jobs are most vulnerable to robotization:    • Category 1 workers: non-repetitive, non-complex: Gardeners, plumbers, ski instructors, hair-dressers… These jobs are not in danger and will likely continue to be the largest source of job growth across the OECD and emerging markets. • Category 2 workers: non-repetitive, complex: Pharmaceutical research, software coding, civil or mechanical engineering, hedge fund managers... Such jobs are not in danger. Quite the contrary - demand will likely increase and salaries rise, allowing those working in these fields to purchase more goods and services from the workers toiling in categories 1, 3 and 4. • Category 3 workers: repetitive and complex: Airline pilots, surgeons, highly qualified industrial jobs, equity traders…Within the OECD, these are the jobs threatened by the Robolution. • Category 4 workers: repetitive, very simple: Manufacturing jobs, low-end farming jobs etc… Think Charlie Chaplin in the movie Modern Times. Such jobs have already disappeared in the OECD - they will now disappear in emerging markets.  For clarity, I put Mr. Gave's thinking into a graphical model:          Non-complex Complex   Non-repetitive Cat 1: Gardeners, plumbers, ski instructors, hair dressers Cat 2: Pharmaceutical research, software coding, civil or mechanical engineering, hedge fund managers   Repetitive Cat 4: Manufacturing, low end farming jobs, Cat 3: Airline pilots, surgeons, highly qualified industrial jobs, equity traders   If you are young or you have kids, it is already a revolutionary idea they may not be best off going through University to end up with a Cat 3 job. It may actually be much better to go for a Cat 1 job while they save a lot of money on student loans.
 Super-interesting… but how does this apply to investing in Robotics stock? There is a quote out there somewhere by a VC or a successful serial entrepreneur. I don't know which one and I can't remember the quote very well because an hour of Google searches didn't turn it up. The question is what he looks for starting a business. He answers something like: I look for industries with a lot of jobs and see if I can kill them If you know the exact quote and/or who said it please help me out in the comments. It's a brutal way to go about your daily business but I guess he found it a reliable model to come up with good investments/business plans. We can borrow this train of thought and couple it with the LVG model to get to an interesting investment set. Look for firms with an abundance of category 3 and 4 employees. These firms are positioned well to expand their margins the most when robots become cheaper and improve. In terms of profiting from the robo revolution, ideal investment candidates would have at least several of the following characteristics:  Subject to a high degree of labour protection regulation Low Enterprise Value/Employee count Highly robust Employees are not an intrinsic part of the product  Subject to massive labour protection regulation It seems counterintuitive to look for candidates in countries with massive labour protection regulation. Admittedly, management will switch to robotization last because the initial savings will be the least. However, a pool of labour that is highly protected is likely to be very inefficient to begin with. In addition, robotization may well be one of these trends where there's a last mover advantage. The first few firms to invest are buying very expensive robots that over time are still worth it. Initially, that puts pressure on the remaining firms who haven't robotized but when these switch to robotization a few years later, and achieve greater productivity gains at lower CapEx, the tables are turned. Low Enterprise Value/Labour cost
 You'll want to have an investment candidate that is spending a lot on employee salaries to generate its revenues. An investment based on robotization will have a higher RoI; the higher labour costs are compared to Enterprise Value. On a more detailed level, there will be lots of caveats but on a high level it should hold up. This is a very important attribute, perhaps the most important after the next two. Highly robust firms Robots are getting better, that's obvious. How good do they get? How cheap do they get? How fast will their use spread? are all questions that are still open. It will be fairly easy to make the right observation but in the end, still fail to profit because the firm you are counting on got disrupted itself. One principal that will help you to profit from future cash flows is to bet on firms that are very hard to kill. As Howard Marks says: To finish first you must first finish. Employees are not an intrinsic part of the product You aren't going to do very well implementing a model to profit of robotization if you pick a firm where it just won't work. Somewhat of a weird example (and not legal in all geographies) is that of an escort organisation. Employee costs eat up a lot of cash flow. The services are non-complex and repetitive. Yet, I'm skeptical of robotization. Firms that could benefit from robotization By no means an exhaustive list here are eight names that have the potential to benefit from robots evolving: G4S Plc ADR G4S Plc ADR (OTCPK:GFSZY) offers security services. It operates on six continents and employs 623,000 people. I'm fairly sure not all of these men and women are about to lose their jobs but many of the roles fulfilled within this company seem fairly susceptible to automation or robotization. It won't come as a surprise. One man or women can already survey many locations at once through technological advancement. The company could score better on robustness with EBITDA at only 3.2 x net debt. However, the firm is taking it to 2.5x, which is much better. Demand for security seems fairly resilient although the medium through which is delivered is always changing.
 Securitas Securitas A B (OTC:SCTBY) does many of the same things as G4S. It employs 330,000 people in 53 countries. It's a little bit safer compared to G4S. However, G4S scores better on the important Enterprise Value/Employee metric. Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ADR Casino Guichard Perrachon SA ADR (OTCPK:CGUSY) A large grocery store operator with 325,820 employees. As a kid, I've stacked shelves and I'm fairly certain it's a task that can and will be robotized. However, not all employees will disappear because of robotization. When I reviewed Ahold (OTCQX:ADRNY) a while back I was really impressed with the self-checkout counters: 

 Source: as apparent from the terrible picture quality, the picture is author's own If the customers can do the work themselves, there is no need to invest in robots. Even better. Back to Casino, the firm doesn't score very well on robustness as its debt is quite high. However, given the ambitious plan to cut down on debt: 

 Source: company presentation and the resilient nature of demand for its products, I've included it anyway. Casino isn't your only choice. Many retailers could be interesting candidates. ISS A/S ADR ISS A/S ADR (OTCPK:ISSDY) A facility services company that could be interesting. It offers many of the same services as the securities companies discussed earlier but also cleaning and catering services. Both services that are ripe for robotization.
 Compass Group Plc ADR Compass Group (OTCPK:CMPGY) operates a lot of restaurants, employing 500,000 people worldwide. The majority of jobs in restaurants from busboy to server to chef are not immune to robotization. The company is also focused on efficiency in labour costs as apparent from this slide in its investor presentation: 

 Management also identified automation as a source of labour cost efficiency gains but not robotization. Why I wrote this up while I'm skeptical of prediction There's nothing preventing investors of applying a fundamental analysis methodology to a set of companies with these characteristics. If the investment makes a lot of sense based on a subsequent fundamental analysis, the potential optionality derived from robotization through the industry comes free, as opposed to when you buy companies that are focused on robotics and where future prospects are priced in.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

History[edit]
In 1892, Geoffroy Guichard became the sole proprietor of a grocery store located in the old Casino Lyrique cabaret in Saint-Étienne, which remained the Group’s flagship store for many years and is the origin of the group’s current title.
On June 25, 1898 Geoffroy Guichard opened the first branch store in Veauche and, on August 2 of the same year, he set up the Société des Magasins du Casino et Établissements Économiques d'Alimentation, operating under the name "Guichard-Perrachon & Cie". Following the company’s creation, the focus began to shift towards organisation with the construction of a warehouse in Saint-Étienne.[2]
The first Casino-brand products were launched in 1901, introducing the concept of private brands. 1902 saw the introduction of a customer loyalty programme that offered trading stamps for store purchases. The first factories in the Loire region were opened four years later and by 1916 the company had introduced a family allowance fund and a proft-sharing system for their employees.[3]
The first self-service store was opened in 1948 followed by the installation of France’s first refigerated display in 1949. Almost a decade later, Casino became the first French food retailer to display a sell-by date on their products, a practice that did not become mandatory in France until 1984. In 1975, Casino joined the global market through its expansion into the United States.
By 1992, the group had acquired La Ruche Méridionale before merging with Rallye, a French retailer owned by Jean-Charles Naouri, by giving 30% of Casino. 1997 saw the development of a hostile takeover bid from retailer Promodès. However, the bid fell through due to the combined efforts of Jean-Charles Naouri, the Guichard family, and the Group’s employees. The following year, Jean-Charles Naouri became the Group’s majority shareholder.
Between 2000 and 2001, Casino acquired 50% of the variety retailer Monoprix as well as the discount chains Franprix, Leader Price, and Cdiscount. Banque Casino was founded and the property company Mercialys is established to manage the Group’s shopping centers. In 2007, the Group inaugurated its new headquarters in Saint-Étienne, its historical stronghold.[4]
In 2010, the group acquired Carrefour’s interests in Thailand. The same year the GreenYellow subsidiary connected its first solar power plant to the French power grid. In June 2012 the Group acquired a 50% stake in Monoprix from the Galeries Lafayette.[5] Later that month they also acquired a controlling interest in the Brazil-based Pão de Açúcar. More recently, Groupe Casino gained management control of two of the Groupe’s foundational assets: GPA in Brazil and Monoprix in France.[6]
Positioning and strategy[edit]
With the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo Pão de Açúcar in Brazil and the agreement with Galeries Lafayette to acquire 50% of Monoprix, 2012 saw Groupe Casino raise its profile in high-growth markets. Today, the Group has a network of more than 12,000 stores, of which 9,450 are in France. It operates in eight countries, generating net sales of €48,645 million and employing 329,000 people (2013).
The Group’s operations are based on a multi-format, multi-banner, multi-channel approach and a dual retailing/property business model.[7]
International markets[edit]
The Group focuses on countries that offer high potential for growth and in which the Group’s subsidiaries have a strong local presence. Based on these criteria, Group currently concentrates on South America.
In 2013, emerging markets accounted for 60% of consolidated net sales (vs 56% in 2012), and 74% of consolidated trading profit (or €2,363 million). Groupe Casino is number one retailer in Brazil and Colombia.[8]
Casino holds leadership positions in these markets:

Largest retailer in Latin America[citation needed]
Largest food and non-food retailer in Brazil[citation needed]
Largest retailer in Colombia[citation needed]

France[edit]
Casino currently focuses on expanding its multi-format portfolio in the convenience and discount segments. Its business model is built on a network of strategically related, yet clearly differentiated banners – Spar and Vival (urban and rural superettes), Monoprix and Franprix (centre-city stores), Leader Price (discount outlets) and Naturalia (organic foods). With its 6,500 convenience stores, Casino leads this segment in France.[citation needed]
Private labels[edit]
The Casino Group’s portfolio comprises dozens of private labels covering a board range for apparel, gourmet, family, organic, fair trade, board-based, discount… The “Casino” brand is one of the best-selling private labels in France today in terms of penetration rates (own-brand sales relative to total store sales). Most of the Casino Group’s private label products for textile, home and food categories are manufactured through its sourcing division, Casino Global Sourcing which headquartered in Hong Kong.
E-commerce[edit]
Casino Group is a leading player in the French non-food e-tailer market with Cdiscount, and has built several grocery e-tailing solutions under its banners: Mescoursescasino.fr, Casinodrive.fr and Monoprix.fr. In Colombia, Casino is also one of the leaders in this growing segment via its banner websites (Exito.com,Carulla.com), and in Brazil, GPA’s subsidiary Nova Pontocom now ranks second in its market.
Property[edit]
A distinctive feature of the Groupe Casino business model is its dual retailing/property approach in France through two subsidiaries: Mercialys, a retail property company and Immobilière Group Casino, which owns the Group’s store properties.
Operations[edit]




Casino Géant


In 2012, Casino had more than 12,000 outlets (126 hypermarkets, 446 supermarkets, 2,476 discount stores, 6,457 convenience stores and 299 restaurants) in France and abroad, usually through investments in local retailers. Examples include Libertad and Mini Libertad in Argentina, Disco and Devoto in Uruguay, Pão de Açúcar and Extra in Brazil, Exito in Colombia and other outlets in a dozen African countries and the Indian Ocean.[9]
On 2 July 2012, Casino became the sole controlling shareholder of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Brazil’s leading retailer and second largest online retailer. Grupo Pão de Açúcar has annual sales of €20.2 billion with a multi-format, multi-brand portfolio of more than 1,600 stores and 159,800 employees, making it the leading private-sector employer in Brazil. The controlling interest acquired in Pão de Açúcar significantly boosted the Group’s size, positioning it among the world's largest retailers.[10]
In mainland France, Casino operates the following brands: Hyper Géant Casino (126 stores) Casino Supermarché (446), Monoprix (555), Franprix and Leader Price (600), Spar, Vival, Petit Casino and Casino Restauration. On Reunion Island, its brands are Géant Casino and Leader Price.
In 2005, Casino created Mercialys, a REIT-style listed property company that today manages some 150 shopping centres that are adjacent to Casino-owned hypermarkets and supermarkets, as well as the Group’s cafeteria properties.
In March 2012, Franprix announced plan to supply its 80 stores in central Paris with 450 tonnes of goods a day via the Marne and Seine Rivers, thereby shortening delivery times and reducing the environmental impact.[11]

History[edit]
In 1892, Geoffroy Guichard became the sole proprietor of a grocery store located in the old Casino Lyrique cabaret in Saint-Étienne, which remained the Group’s flagship store for many years and is the origin of the group’s current title.
On June 25, 1898 Geoffroy Guichard opened the first branch store in Veauche and, on August 2 of the same year, he set up the Société des Magasins du Casino et Établissements Économiques d'Alimentation, operating under the name "Guichard-Perrachon & Cie". Following the company’s creation, the focus began to shift towards organisation with the construction of a warehouse in Saint-Étienne.[2]
The first Casino-brand products were launched in 1901, introducing the concept of private brands. 1902 saw the introduction of a customer loyalty programme that offered trading stamps for store purchases. The first factories in the Loire region were opened four years later and by 1916 the company had introduced a family allowance fund and a proft-sharing system for their employees.[3]
The first self-service store was opened in 1948 followed by the installation of France’s first refigerated display in 1949. Almost a decade later, Casino became the first French food retailer to display a sell-by date on their products, a practice that did not become mandatory in France until 1984. In 1975, Casino joined the global market through its expansion into the United States.
By 1992, the group had acquired La Ruche Méridionale before merging with Rallye, a French retailer owned by Jean-Charles Naouri, by giving 30% of Casino. 1997 saw the development of a hostile takeover bid from retailer Promodès. However, the bid fell through due to the combined efforts of Jean-Charles Naouri, the Guichard family, and the Group’s employees. The following year, Jean-Charles Naouri became the Group’s majority shareholder.
Between 2000 and 2001, Casino acquired 50% of the variety retailer Monoprix as well as the discount chains Franprix, Leader Price, and Cdiscount. Banque Casino was founded and the property company Mercialys is established to manage the Group’s shopping centers. In 2007, the Group inaugurated its new headquarters in Saint-Étienne, its historical stronghold.[4]
In 2010, the group acquired Carrefour’s interests in Thailand. The same year the GreenYellow subsidiary connected its first solar power plant to the French power grid. In June 2012 the Group acquired a 50% stake in Monoprix from the Galeries Lafayette.[5] Later that month they also acquired a controlling interest in the Brazil-based Pão de Açúcar. More recently, Groupe Casino gained management control of two of the Groupe’s foundational assets: GPA in Brazil and Monoprix in France.[6]
Positioning and strategy[edit]
With the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo Pão de Açúcar in Brazil and the agreement with Galeries Lafayette to acquire 50% of Monoprix, 2012 saw Groupe Casino raise its profile in high-growth markets. Today, the Group has a network of more than 12,000 stores, of which 9,450 are in France. It operates in eight countries, generating net sales of €48,645 million and employing 329,000 people (2013).
The Group’s operations are based on a multi-format, multi-banner, multi-channel approach and a dual retailing/property business model.[7]
International markets[edit]
The Group focuses on countries that offer high potential for growth and in which the Group’s subsidiaries have a strong local presence. Based on these criteria, Group currently concentrates on South America.
In 2013, emerging markets accounted for 60% of consolidated net sales (vs 56% in 2012), and 74% of consolidated trading profit (or €2,363 million). Groupe Casino is number one retailer in Brazil and Colombia.[8]
Casino holds leadership positions in these markets:

Largest retailer in Latin America[citation needed]
Largest food and non-food retailer in Brazil[citation needed]
Largest retailer in Colombia[citation needed]

France[edit]
Casino currently focuses on expanding its multi-format portfolio in the convenience and discount segments. Its business model is built on a network of strategically related, yet clearly differentiated banners – Spar and Vival (urban and rural superettes), Monoprix and Franprix (centre-city stores), Leader Price (discount outlets) and Naturalia (organic foods). With its 6,500 convenience stores, Casino leads this segment in France.[citation needed]
Private labels[edit]
The Casino Group’s portfolio comprises dozens of private labels covering a board range for apparel, gourmet, family, organic, fair trade, board-based, discount… The “Casino” brand is one of the best-selling private labels in France today in terms of penetration rates (own-brand sales relative to total store sales). Most of the Casino Group’s private label products for textile, home and food categories are manufactured through its sourcing division, Casino Global Sourcing which headquartered in Hong Kong.
E-commerce[edit]
Casino Group is a leading player in the French non-food e-tailer market with Cdiscount, and has built several grocery e-tailing solutions under its banners: Mescoursescasino.fr, Casinodrive.fr and Monoprix.fr. In Colombia, Casino is also one of the leaders in this growing segment via its banner websites (Exito.com,Carulla.com), and in Brazil, GPA’s subsidiary Nova Pontocom now ranks second in its market.
Property[edit]
A distinctive feature of the Groupe Casino business model is its dual retailing/property approach in France through two subsidiaries: Mercialys, a retail property company and Immobilière Group Casino, which owns the Group’s store properties.
Operations[edit]




Casino Géant


In 2012, Casino had more than 12,000 outlets (126 hypermarkets, 446 supermarkets, 2,476 discount stores, 6,457 convenience stores and 299 restaurants) in France and abroad, usually through investments in local retailers. Examples include Libertad and Mini Libertad in Argentina, Disco and Devoto in Uruguay, Pão de Açúcar and Extra in Brazil, Exito in Colombia and other outlets in a dozen African countries and the Indian Ocean.[9]
On 2 July 2012, Casino became the sole controlling shareholder of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Brazil’s leading retailer and second largest online retailer. Grupo Pão de Açúcar has annual sales of €20.2 billion with a multi-format, multi-brand portfolio of more than 1,600 stores and 159,800 employees, making it the leading private-sector employer in Brazil. The controlling interest acquired in Pão de Açúcar significantly boosted the Group’s size, positioning it among the world's largest retailers.[10]
In mainland France, Casino operates the following brands: Hyper Géant Casino (126 stores) Casino Supermarché (446), Monoprix (555), Franprix and Leader Price (600), Spar, Vival, Petit Casino and Casino Restauration. On Reunion Island, its brands are Géant Casino and Leader Price.
In 2005, Casino created Mercialys, a REIT-style listed property company that today manages some 150 shopping centres that are adjacent to Casino-owned hypermarkets and supermarkets, as well as the Group’s cafeteria properties.
In March 2012, Franprix announced plan to supply its 80 stores in central Paris with 450 tonnes of goods a day via the Marne and Seine Rivers, thereby shortening delivery times and reducing the environmental impact.[11]

History[edit]
In 1892, Geoffroy Guichard became the sole proprietor of a grocery store located in the old Casino Lyrique cabaret in Saint-Étienne, which remained the Group’s flagship store for many years and is the origin of the group’s current title.
On June 25, 1898 Geoffroy Guichard opened the first branch store in Veauche and, on August 2 of the same year, he set up the Société des Magasins du Casino et Établissements Économiques d'Alimentation, operating under the name "Guichard-Perrachon & Cie". Following the company’s creation, the focus began to shift towards organisation with the construction of a warehouse in Saint-Étienne.[2]
The first Casino-brand products were launched in 1901, introducing the concept of private brands. 1902 saw the introduction of a customer loyalty programme that offered trading stamps for store purchases. The first factories in the Loire region were opened four years later and by 1916 the company had introduced a family allowance fund and a proft-sharing system for their employees.[3]
The first self-service store was opened in 1948 followed by the installation of France’s first refigerated display in 1949. Almost a decade later, Casino became the first French food retailer to display a sell-by date on their products, a practice that did not become mandatory in France until 1984. In 1975, Casino joined the global market through its expansion into the United States.
By 1992, the group had acquired La Ruche Méridionale before merging with Rallye, a French retailer owned by Jean-Charles Naouri, by giving 30% of Casino. 1997 saw the development of a hostile takeover bid from retailer Promodès. However, the bid fell through due to the combined efforts of Jean-Charles Naouri, the Guichard family, and the Group’s employees. The following year, Jean-Charles Naouri became the Group’s majority shareholder.
Between 2000 and 2001, Casino acquired 50% of the variety retailer Monoprix as well as the discount chains Franprix, Leader Price, and Cdiscount. Banque Casino was founded and the property company Mercialys is established to manage the Group’s shopping centers. In 2007, the Group inaugurated its new headquarters in Saint-Étienne, its historical stronghold.[4]
In 2010, the group acquired Carrefour’s interests in Thailand. The same year the GreenYellow subsidiary connected its first solar power plant to the French power grid. In June 2012 the Group acquired a 50% stake in Monoprix from the Galeries Lafayette.[5] Later that month they also acquired a controlling interest in the Brazil-based Pão de Açúcar. More recently, Groupe Casino gained management control of two of the Groupe’s foundational assets: GPA in Brazil and Monoprix in France.[6]
Positioning and strategy[edit]
With the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo Pão de Açúcar in Brazil and the agreement with Galeries Lafayette to acquire 50% of Monoprix, 2012 saw Groupe Casino raise its profile in high-growth markets. Today, the Group has a network of more than 12,000 stores, of which 9,450 are in France. It operates in eight countries, generating net sales of €48,645 million and employing 329,000 people (2013).
The Group’s operations are based on a multi-format, multi-banner, multi-channel approach and a dual retailing/property business model.[7]
International markets[edit]
The Group focuses on countries that offer high potential for growth and in which the Group’s subsidiaries have a strong local presence. Based on these criteria, Group currently concentrates on South America.
In 2013, emerging markets accounted for 60% of consolidated net sales (vs 56% in 2012), and 74% of consolidated trading profit (or €2,363 million). Groupe Casino is number one retailer in Brazil and Colombia.[8]
Casino holds leadership positions in these markets:

Largest retailer in Latin America[citation needed]
Largest food and non-food retailer in Brazil[citation needed]
Largest retailer in Colombia[citation needed]

France[edit]
Casino currently focuses on expanding its multi-format portfolio in the convenience and discount segments. Its business model is built on a network of strategically related, yet clearly differentiated banners – Spar and Vival (urban and rural superettes), Monoprix and Franprix (centre-city stores), Leader Price (discount outlets) and Naturalia (organic foods). With its 6,500 convenience stores, Casino leads this segment in France.[citation needed]
Private labels[edit]
The Casino Group’s portfolio comprises dozens of private labels covering a board range for apparel, gourmet, family, organic, fair trade, board-based, discount… The “Casino” brand is one of the best-selling private labels in France today in terms of penetration rates (own-brand sales relative to total store sales). Most of the Casino Group’s private label products for textile, home and food categories are manufactured through its sourcing division, Casino Global Sourcing which headquartered in Hong Kong.
E-commerce[edit]
Casino Group is a leading player in the French non-food e-tailer market with Cdiscount, and has built several grocery e-tailing solutions under its banners: Mescoursescasino.fr, Casinodrive.fr and Monoprix.fr. In Colombia, Casino is also one of the leaders in this growing segment via its banner websites (Exito.com,Carulla.com), and in Brazil, GPA’s subsidiary Nova Pontocom now ranks second in its market.
Property[edit]
A distinctive feature of the Groupe Casino business model is its dual retailing/property approach in France through two subsidiaries: Mercialys, a retail property company and Immobilière Group Casino, which owns the Group’s store properties.
Operations[edit]




Casino Géant


In 2012, Casino had more than 12,000 outlets (126 hypermarkets, 446 supermarkets, 2,476 discount stores, 6,457 convenience stores and 299 restaurants) in France and abroad, usually through investments in local retailers. Examples include Libertad and Mini Libertad in Argentina, Disco and Devoto in Uruguay, Pão de Açúcar and Extra in Brazil, Exito in Colombia and other outlets in a dozen African countries and the Indian Ocean.[9]
On 2 July 2012, Casino became the sole controlling shareholder of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Brazil’s leading retailer and second largest online retailer. Grupo Pão de Açúcar has annual sales of €20.2 billion with a multi-format, multi-brand portfolio of more than 1,600 stores and 159,800 employees, making it the leading private-sector employer in Brazil. The controlling interest acquired in Pão de Açúcar significantly boosted the Group’s size, positioning it among the world's largest retailers.[10]
In mainland France, Casino operates the following brands: Hyper Géant Casino (126 stores) Casino Supermarché (446), Monoprix (555), Franprix and Leader Price (600), Spar, Vival, Petit Casino and Casino Restauration. On Reunion Island, its brands are Géant Casino and Leader Price.
In 2005, Casino created Mercialys, a REIT-style listed property company that today manages some 150 shopping centres that are adjacent to Casino-owned hypermarkets and supermarkets, as well as the Group’s cafeteria properties.
In March 2012, Franprix announced plan to supply its 80 stores in central Paris with 450 tonnes of goods a day via the Marne and Seine Rivers, thereby shortening delivery times and reducing the environmental impact.[11]

History[edit]
In 1892, Geoffroy Guichard became the sole proprietor of a grocery store located in the old Casino Lyrique cabaret in Saint-Étienne, which remained the Group’s flagship store for many years and is the origin of the group’s current title.
On June 25, 1898 Geoffroy Guichard opened the first branch store in Veauche and, on August 2 of the same year, he set up the Société des Magasins du Casino et Établissements Économiques d'Alimentation, operating under the name "Guichard-Perrachon & Cie". Following the company’s creation, the focus began to shift towards organisation with the construction of a warehouse in Saint-Étienne.[2]
The first Casino-brand products were launched in 1901, introducing the concept of private brands. 1902 saw the introduction of a customer loyalty programme that offered trading stamps for store purchases. The first factories in the Loire region were opened four years later and by 1916 the company had introduced a family allowance fund and a proft-sharing system for their employees.[3]
The first self-service store was opened in 1948 followed by the installation of France’s first refigerated display in 1949. Almost a decade later, Casino became the first French food retailer to display a sell-by date on their products, a practice that did not become mandatory in France until 1984. In 1975, Casino joined the global market through its expansion into the United States.
By 1992, the group had acquired La Ruche Méridionale before merging with Rallye, a French retailer owned by Jean-Charles Naouri, by giving 30% of Casino. 1997 saw the development of a hostile takeover bid from retailer Promodès. However, the bid fell through due to the combined efforts of Jean-Charles Naouri, the Guichard family, and the Group’s employees. The following year, Jean-Charles Naouri became the Group’s majority shareholder.
Between 2000 and 2001, Casino acquired 50% of the variety retailer Monoprix as well as the discount chains Franprix, Leader Price, and Cdiscount. Banque Casino was founded and the property company Mercialys is established to manage the Group’s shopping centers. In 2007, the Group inaugurated its new headquarters in Saint-Étienne, its historical stronghold.[4]
In 2010, the group acquired Carrefour’s interests in Thailand. The same year the GreenYellow subsidiary connected its first solar power plant to the French power grid. In June 2012 the Group acquired a 50% stake in Monoprix from the Galeries Lafayette.[5] Later that month they also acquired a controlling interest in the Brazil-based Pão de Açúcar. More recently, Groupe Casino gained management control of two of the Groupe’s foundational assets: GPA in Brazil and Monoprix in France.[6]
Positioning and strategy[edit]
With the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo Pão de Açúcar in Brazil and the agreement with Galeries Lafayette to acquire 50% of Monoprix, 2012 saw Groupe Casino raise its profile in high-growth markets. Today, the Group has a network of more than 12,000 stores, of which 9,450 are in France. It operates in eight countries, generating net sales of €48,645 million and employing 329,000 people (2013).
The Group’s operations are based on a multi-format, multi-banner, multi-channel approach and a dual retailing/property business model.[7]
International markets[edit]
The Group focuses on countries that offer high potential for growth and in which the Group’s subsidiaries have a strong local presence. Based on these criteria, Group currently concentrates on South America.
In 2013, emerging markets accounted for 60% of consolidated net sales (vs 56% in 2012), and 74% of consolidated trading profit (or €2,363 million). Groupe Casino is number one retailer in Brazil and Colombia.[8]
Casino holds leadership positions in these markets:

Largest retailer in Latin America[citation needed]
Largest food and non-food retailer in Brazil[citation needed]
Largest retailer in Colombia[citation needed]

France[edit]
Casino currently focuses on expanding its multi-format portfolio in the convenience and discount segments. Its business model is built on a network of strategically related, yet clearly differentiated banners – Spar and Vival (urban and rural superettes), Monoprix and Franprix (centre-city stores), Leader Price (discount outlets) and Naturalia (organic foods). With its 6,500 convenience stores, Casino leads this segment in France.[citation needed]
Private labels[edit]
The Casino Group’s portfolio comprises dozens of private labels covering a board range for apparel, gourmet, family, organic, fair trade, board-based, discount… The “Casino” brand is one of the best-selling private labels in France today in terms of penetration rates (own-brand sales relative to total store sales). Most of the Casino Group’s private label products for textile, home and food categories are manufactured through its sourcing division, Casino Global Sourcing which headquartered in Hong Kong.
E-commerce[edit]
Casino Group is a leading player in the French non-food e-tailer market with Cdiscount, and has built several grocery e-tailing solutions under its banners: Mescoursescasino.fr, Casinodrive.fr and Monoprix.fr. In Colombia, Casino is also one of the leaders in this growing segment via its banner websites (Exito.com,Carulla.com), and in Brazil, GPA’s subsidiary Nova Pontocom now ranks second in its market.
Property[edit]
A distinctive feature of the Groupe Casino business model is its dual retailing/property approach in France through two subsidiaries: Mercialys, a retail property company and Immobilière Group Casino, which owns the Group’s store properties.
Operations[edit]




Casino Géant


In 2012, Casino had more than 12,000 outlets (126 hypermarkets, 446 supermarkets, 2,476 discount stores, 6,457 convenience stores and 299 restaurants) in France and abroad, usually through investments in local retailers. Examples include Libertad and Mini Libertad in Argentina, Disco and Devoto in Uruguay, Pão de Açúcar and Extra in Brazil, Exito in Colombia and other outlets in a dozen African countries and the Indian Ocean.[9]
On 2 July 2012, Casino became the sole controlling shareholder of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Brazil’s leading retailer and second largest online retailer. Grupo Pão de Açúcar has annual sales of €20.2 billion with a multi-format, multi-brand portfolio of more than 1,600 stores and 159,800 employees, making it the leading private-sector employer in Brazil. The controlling interest acquired in Pão de Açúcar significantly boosted the Group’s size, positioning it among the world's largest retailers.[10]
In mainland France, Casino operates the following brands: Hyper Géant Casino (126 stores) Casino Supermarché (446), Monoprix (555), Franprix and Leader Price (600), Spar, Vival, Petit Casino and Casino Restauration. On Reunion Island, its brands are Géant Casino and Leader Price.
In 2005, Casino created Mercialys, a REIT-style listed property company that today manages some 150 shopping centres that are adjacent to Casino-owned hypermarkets and supermarkets, as well as the Group’s cafeteria properties.
In March 2012, Franprix announced plan to supply its 80 stores in central Paris with 450 tonnes of goods a day via the Marne and Seine Rivers, thereby shortening delivery times and reducing the environmental impact.[11]

History[edit]
In 1892, Geoffroy Guichard became the sole proprietor of a grocery store located in the old Casino Lyrique cabaret in Saint-Étienne, which remained the Group’s flagship store for many years and is the origin of the group’s current title.
On June 25, 1898 Geoffroy Guichard opened the first branch store in Veauche and, on August 2 of the same year, he set up the Société des Magasins du Casino et Établissements Économiques d'Alimentation, operating under the name "Guichard-Perrachon & Cie". Following the company’s creation, the focus began to shift towards organisation with the construction of a warehouse in Saint-Étienne.[2]
The first Casino-brand products were launched in 1901, introducing the concept of private brands. 1902 saw the introduction of a customer loyalty programme that offered trading stamps for store purchases. The first factories in the Loire region were opened four years later and by 1916 the company had introduced a family allowance fund and a proft-sharing system for their employees.[3]
The first self-service store was opened in 1948 followed by the installation of France’s first refigerated display in 1949. Almost a decade later, Casino became the first French food retailer to display a sell-by date on their products, a practice that did not become mandatory in France until 1984. In 1975, Casino joined the global market through its expansion into the United States.
By 1992, the group had acquired La Ruche Méridionale before merging with Rallye, a French retailer owned by Jean-Charles Naouri, by giving 30% of Casino. 1997 saw the development of a hostile takeover bid from retailer Promodès. However, the bid fell through due to the combined efforts of Jean-Charles Naouri, the Guichard family, and the Group’s employees. The following year, Jean-Charles Naouri became the Group’s majority shareholder.
Between 2000 and 2001, Casino acquired 50% of the variety retailer Monoprix as well as the discount chains Franprix, Leader Price, and Cdiscount. Banque Casino was founded and the property company Mercialys is established to manage the Group’s shopping centers. In 2007, the Group inaugurated its new headquarters in Saint-Étienne, its historical stronghold.[4]
In 2010, the group acquired Carrefour’s interests in Thailand. The same year the GreenYellow subsidiary connected its first solar power plant to the French power grid. In June 2012 the Group acquired a 50% stake in Monoprix from the Galeries Lafayette.[5] Later that month they also acquired a controlling interest in the Brazil-based Pão de Açúcar. More recently, Groupe Casino gained management control of two of the Groupe’s foundational assets: GPA in Brazil and Monoprix in France.[6]
Positioning and strategy[edit]
With the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo Pão de Açúcar in Brazil and the agreement with Galeries Lafayette to acquire 50% of Monoprix, 2012 saw Groupe Casino raise its profile in high-growth markets. Today, the Group has a network of more than 12,000 stores, of which 9,450 are in France. It operates in eight countries, generating net sales of €48,645 million and employing 329,000 people (2013).
The Group’s operations are based on a multi-format, multi-banner, multi-channel approach and a dual retailing/property business model.[7]
International markets[edit]
The Group focuses on countries that offer high potential for growth and in which the Group’s subsidiaries have a strong local presence. Based on these criteria, Group currently concentrates on South America.
In 2013, emerging markets accounted for 60% of consolidated net sales (vs 56% in 2012), and 74% of consolidated trading profit (or €2,363 million). Groupe Casino is number one retailer in Brazil and Colombia.[8]
Casino holds leadership positions in these markets:

Largest retailer in Latin America[citation needed]
Largest food and non-food retailer in Brazil[citation needed]
Largest retailer in Colombia[citation needed]

France[edit]
Casino currently focuses on expanding its multi-format portfolio in the convenience and discount segments. Its business model is built on a network of strategically related, yet clearly differentiated banners – Spar and Vival (urban and rural superettes), Monoprix and Franprix (centre-city stores), Leader Price (discount outlets) and Naturalia (organic foods). With its 6,500 convenience stores, Casino leads this segment in France.[citation needed]
Private labels[edit]
The Casino Group’s portfolio comprises dozens of private labels covering a board range for apparel, gourmet, family, organic, fair trade, board-based, discount… The “Casino” brand is one of the best-selling private labels in France today in terms of penetration rates (own-brand sales relative to total store sales). Most of the Casino Group’s private label products for textile, home and food categories are manufactured through its sourcing division, Casino Global Sourcing which headquartered in Hong Kong.
E-commerce[edit]
Casino Group is a leading player in the French non-food e-tailer market with Cdiscount, and has built several grocery e-tailing solutions under its banners: Mescoursescasino.fr, Casinodrive.fr and Monoprix.fr. In Colombia, Casino is also one of the leaders in this growing segment via its banner websites (Exito.com,Carulla.com), and in Brazil, GPA’s subsidiary Nova Pontocom now ranks second in its market.
Property[edit]
A distinctive feature of the Groupe Casino business model is its dual retailing/property approach in France through two subsidiaries: Mercialys, a retail property company and Immobilière Group Casino, which owns the Group’s store properties.
Operations[edit]




Casino Géant


In 2012, Casino had more than 12,000 outlets (126 hypermarkets, 446 supermarkets, 2,476 discount stores, 6,457 convenience stores and 299 restaurants) in France and abroad, usually through investments in local retailers. Examples include Libertad and Mini Libertad in Argentina, Disco and Devoto in Uruguay, Pão de Açúcar and Extra in Brazil, Exito in Colombia and other outlets in a dozen African countries and the Indian Ocean.[9]
On 2 July 2012, Casino became the sole controlling shareholder of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Brazil’s leading retailer and second largest online retailer. Grupo Pão de Açúcar has annual sales of €20.2 billion with a multi-format, multi-brand portfolio of more than 1,600 stores and 159,800 employees, making it the leading private-sector employer in Brazil. The controlling interest acquired in Pão de Açúcar significantly boosted the Group’s size, positioning it among the world's largest retailers.[10]
In mainland France, Casino operates the following brands: Hyper Géant Casino (126 stores) Casino Supermarché (446), Monoprix (555), Franprix and Leader Price (600), Spar, Vival, Petit Casino and Casino Restauration. On Reunion Island, its brands are Géant Casino and Leader Price.
In 2005, Casino created Mercialys, a REIT-style listed property company that today manages some 150 shopping centres that are adjacent to Casino-owned hypermarkets and supermarkets, as well as the Group’s cafeteria properties.
In March 2012, Franprix announced plan to supply its 80 stores in central Paris with 450 tonnes of goods a day via the Marne and Seine Rivers, thereby shortening delivery times and reducing the environmental impact.[11]

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks
