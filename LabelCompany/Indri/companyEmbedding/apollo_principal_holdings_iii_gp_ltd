at any time by so notifying the chairperson in writing. Such
resignation shall take effect upon receipt of such notice by the
chairperson or at such later time as is therein specified, and
unless otherwise specified, the acceptance of such resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective.

(d)

required with respect to any meeting of the Board, and written
notice of any special meeting shall specify the purpose of the
special meeting. Unless waived by all of the Managers in writing
(before, during or after a meeting) or with respect to any Manager
at such meeting, prior notice of any regular or special meeting
(including reconvening a meeting following any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall be given to each Manager at least
three Business Days (or one Business Day in the case of clear and
urgent need) before the date of such meeting. Notice of any meeting
need not be given to any Manager who shall submit, either before,
during or after such meeting, a signed waiver of notice. Attendance
of a Manager at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the Manager attends the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning thereof to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not properly
called or convened.

(b)     
No action may be taken
by the Board unless a quorum is present. A quorum shall consist of
the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of all of the
Managers of which a majority are resident in the United
Kingdom.

(c)     
The Board shall act by
majority vote of all Managers present at the meeting, and each
Manager shall have one vote.

(d)     
No Manager shall be
disqualified from acting on any matter because such Manager is
interested in the matter to be acted upon by the Board so long as
all material aspects of such matter have been disclosed prior to
Board action in reasonable detail to all Managers who are to act on
such matter.

(e)     
Each Manager may
authorize another person or persons to vote and act for such
Manager by proxy, and such person or persons holding such proxy
shall be counted towards the determination of whether a quorum of
the Board is present, as well as for all other purposes when
counting votes or attendance of the Manager who has provided such
proxy. One person may hold more than one proxy.

(f)     
Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the Board (or any committee thereof) may
be taken without a meeting, if at least two-thirds of the Managers
then in office consent in writing to such action.

(g)     
The Board (and each
committee thereof) shall cause to be kept at a location within the
United Kingdom a book of minutes of all of its resolutions or
actions by written consent and in which there shall be recorded
with respect to each meeting of the Board (or any committee
thereof) the time and place of such meeting, whether regular or
special (and if special, how called), the names of those present
and the proceedings thereof.

(h)     
Managers may
participate in a meeting of the Board (or any committee thereof) by
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means
of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear one
another, and such participation shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting.

(i)     
The Board may elect, by
majority of all Managers then in office, a United Kingdom resident
chairperson, who shall either be an executive chairperson or a
nonexecutive chairperson. At each meeting of the Board, the
chairperson shall preside and, in his or her absence, Managers by a
majority vote of those present may appoint any United Kingdom
resident member of the Board to preside at such meeting. The
secretary of the Company (or such other person as shall be
designated by the Board Managers) shall act as secretary at each
meeting of the Board. In case the secretary shall be absent from
any meeting of the Board, an assistant secretary shall perform the
duties of secretary at such meeting or the person presiding at the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting.

(j)     
The Board may designate
one or more committees to take any action that may be taken
hereunder by the Board, which committees shall take actions under
such procedures (not inconsistent with this Agreement) as shall be
designated by it.
 Section 3.05.

Company in their capacity as such.
 Section 3.06.

them in connection with serving on the Board, and (ii) Issuer and

any expenses solely incurred by or attributable to the Issuer or
APO UK (FC) but excluding obligations incurred under the Amended

among APO Corp. and the Apollo Operating Group entities party
thereto, as amended from time to time or as supplemented by an
analogous agreement with Affiliated entities, by the Issuer, income

conversion of the Company. The conduct, control and management of
the Company shall be vested exclusively in the Board. In all
matters relating to or arising out of the conduct of the operation

the Company. No Member who is not also a Manager (and acting in
such capacity) shall take any part in the management or control of
the operation or business of the Company in

capacity as a Member, nor shall any Member who is not also a

power to act for or on behalf of or bind the Company in his or its
capacity as a Member in any respect or assume any obligation or
responsibility of the Company or of any other Member.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may employ one or more
Members from time to time, and such Members, in their capacity as
employees of the Company (and not, for clarity, in their capacity
as Members of the Company), may take part in the control and
management of the business of the Company to the extent such
authority and power to act for or on behalf of the Company has been
delegated to them by the Board.
 Section 3.08.
    
Action by Written

to be taken by the Members pursuant to this Agreement shall be
taken if all Members whose consent or ratification is required

writing.

Agreement or, to the extent not so provided, by resolution passed
by the Board. One person may hold more
