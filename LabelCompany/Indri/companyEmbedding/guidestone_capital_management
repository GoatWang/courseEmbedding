Enroll NowRollover NowSign up for our newsletters Investment Recommendation






GuideStone Capital ManagementServing as the investment adviser to GuideStone Funds™, GuideStone Capital Management™, LLC utilizes a manager-of-managers investment philosophy and process.
GuideStone® began utilizing this approach in 1971, when the first external firm was hired to help oversee a U.S. equity portfolio. Since then, we have continuously broadened and refined our approach to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by global financial markets. Beginning with four commingled accounts in the early years, to registered mutual funds in 2001, we have grown to advise on over $11 billion in assets under management.
Our team establishes the overall portfolio management construction for each fund, including the objective, strategy, allowable exposures and risk/return profile. GuideStone is also responsible for the hiring, monitoring and terminating of the sub-advisers, as well as the allocation of assets among them. We then diligently and thoughtfully construct each fund using a multi-manager structure, in which sub-advisers are selected on the basis of the respective roles they are to play. Each fund's sub-adviser combination and allocation structure represents our vision of the optimal investment option for the fund's respective asset class.

Who We AreWho We ServeWhat We Stand For





Who We AreWhat's in a name? Throughout history, names have been given to people and places with much thought, purpose and expectation. So why "GuideStone"?
"Guide" refers to expert, trustworthy leadership. "Stone" refers to longevity, stability and a solid foundation. Historically, the use of guide stones was common when our ancestors were guided by stones placed as road markers to aid in their travels. Explorers, leaders, road builders and others who had gone that way before set up these guide stones to 1) point direction, 2) gauge distance and 3) warn of danger.
Today, GuideStone continues to join brothers and sisters in Christ on the path to enhancing their financial security. Each step echoes the meaning in our name as we strive to:

Provide expert direction regarding financial, life and health decisions.
Gauge the distance to participants' retirement goals.
Warn of danger concerning inadequate preparation toward financial security.

At GuideStone, we understand the meaning behind our name and take seriously our responsibility to help you journey safely through your ministry. We are honored to serve you as you serve the Lord. 
Staff Bios
We encourage you to get to know the leaders of our organization who exemplify GuideStone's commitment to honor the Lord by being a lifelong partner with our participants in enhancing their financial security.
