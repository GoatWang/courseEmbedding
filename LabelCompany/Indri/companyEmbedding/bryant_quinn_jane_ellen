Quinn, a leading commentator on personal finance, award-winning Newsweek and Good Housekeeping columnist and author of several best-selling books on money, offers the most straightforward and sensible products and strategies she knows and uses to manage money and accumulate wealth without having to think about it.First of all, Quinn recommends that you start saving. Even if you have a paycheck-to-paycheck life with  no money to spare,  she has a tried, true and simple technique to prove you wrong. And if you're already saving, she has ideas for how you can save more without feeling a pinch. She helps you assess your current situation and then provides effective strategies to get you to your financial goals in a smart way.

		 SUMMARY
No longer relegated to reporting on society happenings or household hints, women columnists have over the past twenty years surged across the boundary separating the women's or lifestyle sections and into the formerly male bastions of the editorial, financial, medical, and op-ed pages. Where men previously controlled the nation's news organizations, were the chief opinion givers, and defined what is newsworthy, many women newspaper columnists are now nationally syndicated and tackle the same subjects as their male counterparts, bringing with them distinctive styles and viewpoints. Through these frank and lively interviews, Maria Braden explores the lives and work of columnists Erma Bombeck, Jane Brody, Mona Charen, Merlene Davis, Georgie Anne Geyer, Dorothy Gilliam, Ellen Goodman, Molly Ivins, Mary McGrory, Judith (Miss Manners) Martin, Joyce Maynard, Anna Quindlen, and Jane Bryant Quinn. Profiles describe how these writers got started, where they get the nerve to tell the world what they think, how they generate ideas for columns, and what it's like to create under the pressure of deadlines. Representative columns illustrate their distinctive voices, and an introductory essay provides a historical overview of women in journalism, including pioneering women columnists Fanny Fern, Dorothy Thompson, and Sylvia Porter. Braden finds that today's women columnists frequently raise issues or use examples unique to their gender. Because they are likely to have a direct personal connection to current social issues such as abortion, child care, or sexual harassment, they are able to provide fresh perspectives on these provocative topics. In doing so, they are helping to define what isworthy of attention in the '90s and to shape public response. A unique addition to the literature on women in journalism, this book will interest general readers as well as students of journalism, literature, American studies, and women's studies. Aspiring writers will find here role models and practical guidance.




			Review by
		 Booklist Review
Female columnists are finally being heard. From the wry observations of housefrau Erma Bombeck to the literate, literary Joyce Maynard to the liberal consciousness of Ellen Goodman to the personal/political approach of Anna Quinlan, these women have attacked the issues of the day and brought powerful points of view to the public notice. Easily identifiable with a female audience, their voices are finally reaching men, too, and as a result, changing the way Americans think about the core issues they grapple with daily. Braden, a journalism teacher, opens her book with a chapter on the history and influence of female columnists. She follows with excerpts from columns by 13 of the better well known columnists as well as interviews with them in which they discuss their life and work. The interviews round out their personalities and offer the reader insight into the process of creating a column. ~--Mary Ellen Sullivan

			Review by
		 Publisher's Weekly Review
In a book which should appeal to journalists and to those involved with women's studies, Braden, who teaches journalism at the Univ. of Kentucky, assembles interviews with 13 newspaper women and includes reprints of their work. First offering a sketchy history of women in journalism--which slights Dorothy Thompson--Braden interviews pioneers Mary McGrory of the Washington Post and syndicated columnist Erma Bombeck, then goes on to Chicago Daily News foreign correspondent Georgie Anne Geyer, Boston Globe associate editor Ellen Goodman, syndicated conservative political columnist Mona Charon, Judith Martin (Miss Manners) and others. Two black women are included: Dorothy Gilliam of the Washington Post and Marlene Davis of the Lexington (Ky.) Herald Leader . Perhaps typical of their field, these women are brisk and pointed in their observations, eschewing rhetoric about their difficulties as women journalists. The collection proves to be as informative as it is lively. (May) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved

			Review by
		 Library Journal Review
``Despite the differences between women columnists,'' writes Braden, ``one fact stands out: women's voices often contrast significantly with those of men.'' As proof, she profiles 13 diverse ``women's voices,'' most nationally syndicated or distributed. Interviewed are Mary McGrory, Erma Bombeck, Jane Bryant Quinn, Georgie Anne Geyer, Ellen Goodman, Jane Brody, Dorothy Gilliam, Judith Martin (Miss Manners), Mona Charen, Joyce Maynard, Merlene Davis, Anna Quindlen, and Molly Ivins. Each chapter contains a well-crafted background essay with emphasis on the columnist's writing style and voice, and three examples of her work. Braden also includes an historical essay on women and column writing (from Fanny Fern to Eleanor Roosevelt). Mary McGrory's motto is ``I've got to write it, you don't have to read it.'' But this is well worth reading and an important contribution to journalism, history, and women's studies collections.-- Jo Cates, Northwestern Univ. Lib., Evanston, Ill. (c) Copyright 2010.

Discover The $5 Solution to a Wrinkle Free Face - ALL EXPOSED TODAY!





Various sources across the internet have exposed a HUGE celebrity secret to erase wrinkles - without botox or surgery!

How do Hollywood starlets look so radiant and youthful well into 
thier 40's, 50's, and even 60's? Is it always expensive botox and 
dangerous  plastic surgery? According to various sources, the answer is NO! So if
 they aren't all using surgery to stay looking great, what is their 
secret? Keep reading, it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!
 
It is rumoured that some celebrities are aiming to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Many online sources have expressed suprise over how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was! Read on...
 
“Countless aging celebs are reported to have admitted they avoided surgery and look 20 years younger thanks to the simple advice.”


The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of

The wrinkle secret has been reserved for high paying celebrity clients...until now. Consumers have reported throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago this simple solution was shared!
 
This anti aging miracle was reportedly found when multiple celebrity friends were hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.






“She looked 15 years younger in literally 2 weeks!”

 
They were reported to have been thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, the team came across 2 products that when combined supposedly took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and  costs next to nothing to try! The two products are Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
  

“Possbily the best anti aging discovery of the decade.”
 
 
So what is it?



 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:

1.  Vitamin C
  2.  Hyaluronic Acid



These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase 
wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the
 skin – which is why they’re so effective.
 
Vitamin C, The 1st Youth Discovery:
  The first piece of the anti aging puzzle discovered was Vitamin C.

 "Vitamin C is a secret anti aging trick”
Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new 
collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all 
the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study 
stating, applying non-prescription  Vitamin C to your skin  caused a large reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. This is why Oveena Anti Aging Cream is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.




Hyaluronic Acid:
  The second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C, can make your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic 
Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its 
weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic
 acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from 
dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. Products you can buy over the counter with an effective 
concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream . 





 




 
“What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin 
    generate fresh new ones. Our research shows that you can erase almost 10 to 
    20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose 
    the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality 
    ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.”



"How do I do it?"


It's actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
    These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C 
    and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. His team is also reported to have discovered 
    that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called 
    Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active 
    anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). 




“Getting older is rough for an actress. I feel like a new woman!”




Put to the Test!
As excited as we were, we wanted to find an example of real usage of these type of products. We found one test where a volunteer from the office was used. A 57 year old mother of 3 jumped at the chance to test this combo and the results were pulished online. Here is her story...
 
Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:
"Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most 
women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and 
wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that 
nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly 
risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last
 resort for her." 

Here are the reported results from the source....
 




 


Day 1:

"After the first day of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream together,
 I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. It felt 
like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a 
gigantic vacuum cleaner.
 
I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling 
sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in 
the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of 
revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. 
 
After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it."



day 5:
 
"After five days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream, I was shocked at the drastic results.
The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!
I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger 
again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!"




day 14:
 "After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!

  The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had 
COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin
 with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!
 
After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that
way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and 
radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my 
friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, 
and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!"










Pictures of Brenda Wright at day 1, day 5 & day 14. The picture at the bottom was taken after only 14 days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.


The Verdict:
Using the Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream combo,
 removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It 
tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and 
dehydrated skin.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
