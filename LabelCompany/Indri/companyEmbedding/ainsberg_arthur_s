			Mr. Ainsberg currently serves as a director of Medley Capital Corporation, a closed-end, externally managed financial services company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange, where he is the lead independent director, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. Previously, Mr. Ainsberg served as Chairman of the Audit Committee and member of the Compliance Committee of the board of directors of Nomura Securities International, Inc. (the U.S. based broker-dealer of The Nomura Group) from 1996 through December 2014. In September 2012, Mr. Ainsberg was named to the board of directors of Nomura Global Financial Products, Inc., and in July 2013, he was named to the board of directors of Nomura Holding America, Inc. He served on each board through December 2014. From July 2003 until May 2012, Mr. Ainsberg served as a director of National Financial Partners Corporation, an independent financial services distribution company. From August 2009 until June 2011, Mr. Ainsberg served as Chief Operating Officer of Lehman Brothers Inc. in liquidation. From December 2003 until July 2009, Mr. Ainsberg served as the Independent Consultant for Morgan Stanley & Co. under the Global Research Settlement and was responsible for selecting and monitoring the providers of independent research for clients of Morgan Stanley. Previously, Mr. Ainsberg was Chief Operating Officer at two investment partnerships, Brahman Capital Corp. from 1996 to 2000 and Bessent Capital Corp. during 2001. He also served as Chairman of the New York State Board for Public Accountancy from 1999 to 2000 and was a member of that board from 1993 to 2001. From 1998 to 2000, he was also a member of the Board of District 10 of the National Association of Securities Dealers. He has served as a director of the Company since 2013.
Due to his over 40 years of experience in the financial services industry, his deep understanding of accounting matters for public financial services companies and his experience as a board member of a large U.S.-based broker-dealer, we believe Mr. Ainsberg should serve as a member of our board of directors.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

                        "Tucking plenty of wordplay into the brief text to complement his playful, loosely drawn illustrations, Howard produces another child-friendly episode, this one with an underlying message about parental expectations and being allowed to be one's own fool. (Picture book. 5-7)"
                        
                    Another perceptive, deceptively cartoonish tale from Howard.

                        "XXII Big balloons,'' when no more than XII are shown), this curiosity may bemuse more than it educates, but it does give graphic expression to some huge numbers, and so may find a use beyond the alphanumeric byway it explores. (Picture book. 7-9)"
                        
                    Geisert (Haystack, 1995, etc.) draws upon legions of diminutive pigs to demonstrate the meanings and construction of roman numerals; tubby porculi trot and tussle—in swarms for the larger numbers—about farmyards, a playground, parkland, and a rather scanty junkyard.

                    A heat wave compels an industrious community of island piggies to build a giant ship, complete with masts and rigging, and voyage to retrieve an Arctic iceberg and cool off.

                        "More sophisticated, dark and subtle than Lights Out (2005); fans will delight in the frenetic action and maze of details in the etched illustrations and find relief in the fact that everyone is okay. (Picture book. 5-8)"
                        
                    Geisert adds another link to his inventive, wordless chain-reaction escapades that are awash with cleverness and ingenuity.

                    This whimsical whodunit, longer on visual appeal than internal logic, kicks off with the overnight disappearance of a crop of huge turkey topiaries from the nursery-cum-salvage-yard of aptly named Jambonneau and his dainty wife Merville de Peru.
