We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.

Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th.

BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
