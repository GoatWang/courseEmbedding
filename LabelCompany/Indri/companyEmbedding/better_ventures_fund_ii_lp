Better Ventures Invests in Apostrophe to Scale Healthcare Access and Savings



June 27, 2017  /  Shrina Kurani














We are thrilled to announce our latest investment: Apostrophe! Apostrophe is a Denver, CO-based healthtech startup that administers self-insured employer healthcare plans, making best practices available to employers while making high-quality care available to employees. We led the company’s $1.15M seed round, alongside co-investors TechStars and Royal Street Ventures. Apostrophe is addressing the underlying healthcare problems of high costs, extreme complexity and frustrating user experience. By standardizing and simplifying payments, they’re streamlining the patient experience and eliminating billing hassles while enabling providers to get paid promptly and in full. In their first six months, Apostrophe has already grown to 2,000 members in 20 rural school districts, saving the districts $250,000 in healthcare costs. The Apostrophe founding team brings a powerful combination of passion for changing healthcare and functional expertise – CEO Cheryl Kellond specializes in product management and launching new products, COO Julia Hutchins is an experienced healthcare executive who scaled a health plan in her prior role, and Kathy Keating is a seasoned technology executive and software engineer specializing in data and payment centric businesses. They are the epitome of what we look for in a mature, complete, mission-driven team. Together, this founding team has curated innovative best practices into a plug-n-play health plan that any self-insured employer can adopt, building healthier businesses, communities, and of course, people. Apostrophe believes that the best way to save money on healthcare is not to limit care and skimp on quality - it’s to provide the right care and the best quality. Working as an overlay to existing health plans or as a full replacement for a TPA and provider network, Apostrophe drastically reduces healthcare costs while delivering a benefit that employees love. Apostrophe provides customers a personalized 5-year plan that outlines how Apostrophe will hold healthcare spending flat or even reduce costs, and then ties compensation to performance.There are two ways to add Apostrophe to your health benefits: Apostrophe Essentials and Apostrophe 360. Apostrophe Essentials works as an overlay to an existing health plan. The platform integrates premium health care services previously only available to the largest employers, such as telemedicine, second opinions, and flat-rate surgeries. Apostrophe then combines the premium services with on-call healthcare concierge to guide employees, replacing existing health plans’ administrators with an advocate. Pricing deals are transparent, and employees will never receive confusing bills again.

Better Ventures Invests in BookNook to Personalize Literacy Education



May 23, 2017  /  Shrina Kurani












We’d like to officially welcome the newest addition to the Better Ventures family: BookNook, an Oakland, CA-based edtech startup that provides tablet-based in-person and virtual literacy instruction for K-12 students. We invested $275k in the company’s $1M seed round, alongside Reach Capital, Urban Innovation Fund, and Impact Engine. BookNook is addressing the educational divide in our country by building a robust solution to improve literacy skills, a fundamental building block upon which all other learning is dependent. BookNook is being used by all types of schools around the country (40 schools already signed up, and counting), but is particularly focused on students who are struggling with reading at underperforming Title 1 schools. And it just works: as the chart below demonstrates, 100% of students in a recent pilot demonstrated growth, while 86% of students advanced more than five months in reading after just two months of using BookNook.







BookNook’s team is impressive. CEO Michael Lombardo has a strong track record in education - he grew his last organization, Reading Partners, to $30M in earned revenue. The team also includes Bay Area native Kendra O'Donoghue, who brings an extensive background in literacy development to the table, and serial entrepreneur Kevin Rohling, who heads up product and engineering. With a particular focus on supporting children in traditionally disenfranchised communities, BookNook is massively expanding students’ access to powerful personalized learning. BookNook is using a monthly subscription model, and helps schools and organizations provide powerful in-person reading instruction. BookNook’s tools can be used by educators, caring adults, and near peers to match each reader’s unique needs, simplify small group time, and engage families as partners. BookNook’s approach is based on decades of research on how kids best learn to read, and makes it easy to adapt for different students with different needs. By pairing engaging texts with standards-based lesson plans, BookNook makes differentiation for small group or one-on-one instruction literally as simple as the push of a button. Because BookNook is designed for both educators and non-educators to use, and parents and caregivers can participate in the learning process as volunteers at school or on their own at home.

Better Ventures | Approach — Better Ventures

























































Better Ventures is a venture capital firm that provides funding and support to companies creating scalable solutions to some of the world’s biggest challenges.





We back entrepreneurs building a better world. Better Ventures provides funding and support to technology companies pursuing social and environmental outcomes with business models that scale.  We back passionate entrepreneurs leveraging the tools and methodologies of the modern technology startup to address some of society's biggest challenges, from narrowing the opportunity gap to improving health outcomes to accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy.  Given the magnitude of these problems and the enormous market opportunities they represent, we seek to back founders with the intellectual capacity and drive to build truly world-changing companies.  If you're up for that challenge, we want to hear from you.  What We Invest InWe back smart and scrappy teams of two or more co-founders building highly scalable and capital efficient technology companies that address big global challenges.  We look for significant and measurable social or environmental impact potential that is created directly through the use of a company's products or services or through the supply chains that produce and deliver them.  We are currently pursuing opportunities in three investment themes:






Opportunity Low-cost web & mobile technologies provide people with access to life-improving opportunities










Health Always-on connectivity and cloud analytics enable improved diagnosis and better preventative health










Sustainability Technology-driven innovations are accelerating the transition to a more sustainable economy



What We Look forWe look for the following characteristics in the startups we back:Two co-founders, one  technical. Ideally CEO and CTO.Information technology product with a significant intrinsic social or environmental impactMinimum viable product or fully-deployed productEncouraging initial indications that customers love your product (see How We Invest below)While we will review funding applications from anywhere, we have a strong preference for companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a special emphasis on Oakland and Berkeley because of the high level of our engagement and due to our commitment to the East Bay startup ecosystem.  If you're looking for office space or considering a relocation, we can help you secure space at ImpactHub Oakland. How We InvestBetter Ventures is a high-engagement seed fund that provides capital, expertise, and an extensive business network to help startups get to the next level.  We look to invest up to $1M in each of our portfolio companies over multiple financing rounds, with initial investments ranging from $100k to $400k (typically for a 7-10% stake) and the remainder reserved for follow-on investments in later rounds. This is how we invest:Pre-Seed: we invest $100k to $200k in pre-seed stage companies with two co-founders (one technical) and a minimum viable product that is pre-market validation but has early signs of encouraging customer engagement. We want to be the first significant investor in your startup, and we will work intensively with you to help you make significant progress towards product-market fit, at which point we will look to lead your seed round. We make pre-seed investment decisions on a rolling quarterly basis through our PreSeed program. Seed: we invest $250k to $400k in seed-stage companies with strong indications of product-market fit (like high usage per user and/or customer willingness to pay) and encouraging customer growth metrics (like double-digit monthly user and/or revenue growth). We make seed investments in new companies as well as existing pre-seed portfolio companies that are ready to go to the next level.Series A and Beyond: we invest up to $1M total in our portfolio companies including prior investments and follow-on at Series A and later rounds. We rarely make a direct Series A investment into a company that we did not back at the seed stage.Apply for funding here. Additional Resources We ProvideBeyond investment capital, we provide support and resources to help startups get to the next level. We are often a company's first significant outside investor, and we devote considerable time and effort to help you succeed. We provide our portfolio companies with the key services they need to get to a successful Series A financing round, including:






Customer Discovery. We help startups identify and listen to customers and iterate their way to product success.










Mentorship. We connect startups with our mentor network of successful entrepreneurs and industry experts who help them navigate big challenges and provide key connections.

What does an LP look for in a venture capital fund manager?

Sixth in a series of weekly posts by myself and Nicholas Lovell of Gamesbrief which answer the fifty questions you should ask before raising venture capital.  We expect the series to run for a year after which we will collate the posts into a book.  You can find the rationale behind the series here, and the list of questions here.  We welcome your comments on any and every aspect of what we are doing. 
————————————— 
 Let me start by explaining two terms in the question.  
‘LP’ is a generic term for an investor in a venture capital fund. Typically they are pension funds or insurance companies (otherwise known as ‘institutional investors’), but they can also be corporates, wealthy individuals or governments looking to stimulate the startup ecosystem.  LP is short for Limited Partner, a reference to the legal status of investors in venture capital funds – technically they are partners in the fund with limited rights and obligations.  I covered this in a little more detail when I answered the question Where do VCs get their money from? 
A ‘venture capital fund manager’ or sometimes ‘venture capitalist’ is the team of people that decide which companies to invest in and then manage them to exit, they are often known as the ‘GP’ or ‘general partner’.  A GP can have multiple funds under management at any one time and they are compensated according to the terms of the GP agreement for each fund which determines the fees and profit share they receive.  I covered this in a little more detail when I answered the question What is venture capital? 
Turning to the question du jour, the first thing that an LP looks for in a venture capital fund manager is track record.  In venture capital past success is a very good indicator of future success, unlike many other asset classes.  Entrepreneurs like to work with investors who have shown an ability to make money and hence VCs with a good track record stand a better than average chance of getting into the best deals and therefore making more money.  Additionally VCs who have had good success have typically built strong networks on the back of that success and are more able to help their companies with introductions to customers and partners. 
The next thing an LP will look for is to see that the team has worked together before.  Ideally they have all worked together in the same manager and developed a good track record together.  Alternatively, if the individuals have worked together in past lives then that might be enough to get the LP comfortable. 
After that the LP will look to the fund structure/strategy – how many investments of what size and in which geographies and sectors the fund manager intends to make.  There are some basics that have to be got right – e.g. the team needs to be large enough to make the planned number of investments when taking into account their commitments to earlier funds, the fees need to be sufficient to cover the planned expenses of the manager.  Some other elements are more subjective and will appeal differently to different LPs – e.g. which sectors the GP intends to invest in (cleantech, internet etc.). 
Finally, if the LP is comfortable on the three items above they will start to look to the terms of the venture fund of which the most important by far are the fees (typically 1.5-2.5% of funds under management) and the profit share or carried interest (typically 15-25% of profits, often after a basic return has been delivered).  LPs look through these percentages to see how much money the partners in the GP will get and as a result larger funds are usually nearer the bottom of the ranges given, whilst smaller funds are able to get nearer the top.  More successful funds are able to command higher fees and carry. 
The first three items (track record, team history, strategy) are typically go or no-go gating items whereas the terms are more of a negotiation.

The “good VCs get better deals” is an interesting angle when it comes to luck. In other words, you could say that the secret to being a good VC is to get lucky once, because once you have a reputation for being lucky, LPs and entrepreneurs want to talk to you.
Of course, I don’t believe in luck, or rather, I believe luck happens and lucky people are those who find ways to be open to lucky situations. So VCs, more than most, need to open to the possibility of Black Swans, and be ready to capitalise on that success.

Guys  great work so far my one comment about this recent post is simplay to ask is this not a bit high level for a focus on the games industry and a book. 
Not all games industry guys get VC that got to be like 1-5% of all games companies raise form Institutions.  
Moreover I think it’s a bit high level to be talking about where VC’s get their money and the value chain of the VC industry. 
It might be more valuable to focus on what sort of  funding levels VCs look to invest at and what sort of returns and equity splits their looking at i.e. more tactical and less strategic VC value chain issues.
As a games company owner looking for funding I don’t need to know where VC’s money comes from I am much more interested in their measures and criteria from investment.

Hey guys great series and articles so far my comment is about relevance for this post if the series is fifty questions you should ask before raising venture capital.
It might be more valuable to focus on what sort of questions to ask your potential VC partner i.e. more tactical advice and less strategic and VC value chain issues.
As a company owner looking for funding I don’t care where my VC money comes. I’ve never had had my board members, investors, co-founders or managers ask me about what a LP is and how a VC raises its money. 
Nor am I going to be sitting down over tea talking to VC partners about their own fund raising struggles, strategies and hardships 🙂  I wouldn’t expect my VC to share that information with me or any other company or company owner looking to raise money with them.
If it is fifty question you should ask before raining venture capital
The next questions in the series to my mind are filling in more detail on what a VC is looking for and what does it involve for a company owner when and if they decide to chase and secure VC funding.
So questions such as
•	How much do they invest?
•	What are the typical format and criteria for investment?
•	What returns and timeframes do they expect a company to deliver?
•	How will they work with the company i.e. does investment require board positions, special share privileges and voting right?
•	What is the general process of getting VC investment?
•	How long will it take?
Beyond that if you think it’s really important to focus on LP’s and talk about the fact that VC’s manage their own investors funds then a further output of this post might be some questions a company owner should ask when performing diligence on their potential VC investor?
•	Has the VC currently got a viable fund under management?
•	Can they invest?
•	What will they invest in?
•	How much of that fund is current invested and not invested?
•	When does the current fund end?
•	When are they expecting to see returns on that fund for their own investors?
•	What terms and RoI are they supposed to deliver to their investors?
•	What other companies have they invested in for that fund?
•	How many failures, successes and exits have they achieved so far with their fund?
•	Can I talk to owners of other companies in the fund and have you got contacts for them
A good VC should have all of this information on hand and a good entrepreneur founder should have these questions lined up if their getting to a term sheet with a VC.

Luck begets success and success begets success, so you are right.  As a VC you don’t get that many chances to be lucky though, so you have to maximise your chances of being fortunate by a) being smart and getting into places where you are more likely to be lucky, and b) working hard and being busy – so you are in more of those places

Thanks for the feedback Alan.  We will endeavour to keep our posts more relevant to entrepreneurs.

In coming years the industry is likely to mature very fast and have an industry model that is more or less apparent. this will somewhat change the way the venture capitalist invests. But the fundamental needs might remain the same. a great team capable of having open communication,up holding a deep vision. and a ready market.

Jonathon Triest, Ludlow Ventures
 


Detroit-based Ludlow Ventures LLC has formed a joint venture with an in-demand Los Angeles-based video producer to create product videos for cash-strapped startups in exchange for equity.The joint venture, Sandwich Fund LLC, launched earlier this month. Ludlow will fund the cost of making the videos, generally about $100,000, according to Jonathon Triest, founder of the seed-stage venture capital firm, which operates a national practice out of the Madison Building.Triest said the investment will come out of a $15 million fund, Ludlow Ventures II LP, that he finished raising last September. He said he will split equity equally with Adam Lisagor, the founder of Sandwich Video Inc., which has made demonstration videos for some of the hottest recent tech startups, including Square Inc., Groupon Inc., Airbnb, Uber and Lyft Inc.In November 2013, Sandwich had its biggest success with a video for San Francisco-based Coin Inc., which makes a digital credit card that combines all your cards into one piece of plastic.The company's video got millions of views in several days, and soon after, Coin was able to hit its crowdfunding goal of $50,000 in 40 minutes. After two weeks, 6 million had seen the video. Coin, which is still in beta testing, hopes to have a formal product launch this spring. Lisagor has been listed on Ludlow's website as entrepreneur-out-of-residence, a play on the more common title of entrepreneur-in-residence, and he was made a partner in the firm in exchange for tips on possible investments. As startups approach Lisagor about doing videos, he alerts Triest to those he considers the most promising for seed-stage investments. One example is Navdy Inc., a San Francisco company that has media buzz for its dashboard-mounted device that displays text messages and smartphone apps on the windshield and allows hands-free operation by voice.Last August, using Lisagor's promotional video, Navdy hit $1 million in orders the week it launched an online sales campaign. It soon closed on a seed round of $6.5 million, which included Ludlow, and the company is reported to be raising another round of $20 million. Earlier this month, a profile in Forbes said that "Lisagor's company makes arguably the best and most sought-after product launch videos in tech, ones that you've probably seen, though you might not have noticed they were all made by the same guy."Triest said Sandwich Fund has closed on its first deal for a company he declined to name because the video has not been made yet. "We'll do five to 10 videos in the next year," he said. "We'll do it from the current fund to test the model, and if it works well, we'll raise a dedicated fund, as well. "We'll get the best and earliest deal flow. Adam hears of deals ahead of the guys on Sand Hill Road at better valuations," said Triest, referring to a street in Menlo Park, Calif., known for its cluster of venture capital firms. Triest said about a third of his second fund has been invested in 32 portfolio companies, with much of the rest of the money reserved for follow-on investments in those funds and for footing the bill for upcoming Sandwich Fund videos. He said he plans to start raising a new fund of at least $35 million in the next few months. That will be in addition to a possible dedicated fund for video production. Triest, a member of the Crain's 20 in their 20s class of 2011, launched Ludlow Ventures in 2009 as an investment vehicle for family members, and prior to raising the current fund, he raised money from them as needed to do deals.He has co-invested in two Detroit companies with Detroit Venture Partners — Chalkfly, an online office supply company that was recently sold, and UpTo Inc., which makes calendar apps.Although based in the Madison Building, most of Ludlow's investments have been elsewhere, including companies based in California, New York, Nevada, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado.

Annotate this Case






SUNI MUNSHANI vs. SIGNAL LAKE VENTURE FUND II, LP, & others. [Note 1]
60 Mass. App. Ct. 714
December 4, 2003 - March 26, 2004
Suffolk County
Present: LENK, MILLS, & TRAINOR, JJ.


Fraud. Practice, Civil, Fraud, Dismissal.




The judge in a civil action was justified in concluding that the 

     plaintiff's conduct in manufacturing evidence, swearing to its authenticity, and continuing to insist on its authenticity for more than seven months while an expert investigated the matter constituted a fraud on the court [718-721]; moreover, the judge, in the exercise of inherent powers, acted within his discretion in imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal of the complaint [721-722]. 




 	      CIVIL ACTION commenced in the Superior Court Department on December 19, 2000.	 




 	      A final judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice was entered by Allan van Gestel, J.	 




 	      Scott P. Lopez for the plaintiff.	 




 	      Carl D. Bernstein, of New York (Joseph F. Hardcastle with him) for the defendants.	 




 MILLS, J.   The plaintiff, Suni Munshani (Munshani), appeals from a Superior Court judgment that dismissed his complaint based on the judge's finding that Munshani committed a fraud on the court by manufacturing evidence, swearing to its authenticity, and continuing to insist on its authenticity for more than seven months while an expert investigated the matter. A related decision by the same judge ordered Munshani to pay the costs and fees of the court's expert and the defendants' attorney's 


Page 715


fees and costs in connection with fraud investigation. [Note 2] In this appeal, Munshani essentially concedes that he fabricated evidence and submitted a false affidavit, but argues that the sanction of dismissal was inappropriate in the circumstances and that the judge's conclusion that Munshani's intentional misconduct constituted a fraud on the court was wrong as matter of law.	 




 	      We affirm.	 




 	      1. Background. On December 18, 2000, Munshani commenced this action seeking $25 million in damages on theories of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of G. L. c. 93A. He alleged oral promises made by the individual defendants, Barton W. Stuck and Michael E. Weingarten, to Munshani, on which Munshani purportedly relied as an inducement to raise capital for Stuck and Weingarten. These individual defendants are in the venture capital business and both are founders, shareholders, and managing directors of defendant Signal Lake II, LLC. Their largest single investment was in a company called Terago Communications, Inc. (Terago), on whose board both individual defendants served.	 




 	      In their answer and counterclaim, the defendants denied Munshani's claim and asserted, among other things, that Munshani had lied to them about his background concerning involvement in litigation and bankruptcy. While acknowledging there had been discussions with Munshani concerning his potential role and compensation by the defendants, the defendants asserted that there was never any agreement between the parties, principally because Munshani kept changing and increasing his demands. Among the defendants' defenses to Munshani's claim for breach of contract was a Statute of Frauds affirmative defense.	 




 	      At the time he initiated the State court proceedings at issue in this appeal, Munshani also commenced a companion action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Terago, claiming he was entitled to 1.2 million shares of Terago stock based on the same alleged services that formed the 


Page 716


basis for his claims in the State court action. [Note 3] Munshani successfully opposed the defendants' motion to dismiss the Federal complaint based on a Statute of Frauds defense by submitting an electronic communication (e-mail) he allegedly received from Terago's president. The Federal judge concluded that the e-mail sufficed, at least for purposes of a motion to dismiss, to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds. The same e-mail was subsequently submitted in the State court proceedings. It is this e-mail, which was not in fact written or sent by Terago's president, that is at the heart of this appeal.	 




 	      On February 16, 2001, alleging that the e-mail submitted in the Federal case was fraudulent, the defendants moved in the State court action for an order seeking the preservation and production for copying all of Munshani's computer hard drives and related back-up tapes and for expedited discovery. Munshani opposed the motion, while also recognizing the "extremely serious [nature of the] accusations." With his opposition, and a copy of the e-mail at issue, Munshani submitted an affidavit (as he had also filed in Federal court) unequivocally stating, "I did not tamper or alter the e-mail in any way." Munshani acknowledged that Hemant Trivedi (Terago's president and the purported sender of the e-mail in question) had prepared an affidavit stating that Trivedi had not sent the e-mail at issue, and Munshani correctly recognized that "[t]he record suggests that either Munshani or Trivedi has submitted a false affidavit." Munshani thus proposed that a neutral expert be appointed by the Superior Court judge to investigate the "extremely serious" allegations. On March 9, 2001, the judge accepted Munshani's proposal and appointed a neutral expert to investigate the allegations relating to the e-mail's authenticity.	 




 	      During the several months of investigation, the parties appeared before the same Superior Court judge on numerous occasions, including in connection with Munshani's requests to stay discovery until the investigation was completed as well as on various other matters related to the investigation. At no point during that time did Munshani confess to his fraud. To the 


Page 717


contrary, he permitted the investigation to continue and perpetuated the charade.	 




 	      On September 12, 2001, the neutral expert submitted a 147-page report in which he concluded that the e-mail was "clearly not authentic." The judge allowed twenty-one days for comment on the report. Munshani filed no objections but, on the very last day of the comment period, submitted a written response invoking his privilege against self-incrimination pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Munshani's response continued, stating that he "therefore declines to testify about or respond to the [expert's report]." The judge accepted the expert's report in its entirety and adopted it as his findings in the matter. In his order, the judge inferred from Munshani's response that his affidavit concerning the e-mail was wholly false and a deliberate and intentional fraud on the court. Such affidavit had set in motion a number of hearings and a detailed investigation by the court-appointed expert. The judge noted that throughout the entire process Munshani remained silent and never once came forward to reveal his fraudulent conduct. The judge thus dismissed Munshani's complaint with prejudice and ordered him to pay the costs and fees of the expert, as well as the defendants' attorney's fees and costs related to the discovery of Munshani's fraud.	 




 	      Munshani now claims that the dismissal was an abuse of discretion because his conduct involved a collateral discovery issue that was unrelated to the merits of any claim or defense in the State case, and that the judge's decision was "ill considered." Munshani also asserts that the judge's "finding" that the e-mail and affidavit were material was clearly erroneous, as was his "finding" that Munshani's conduct constituted a fraud on the court. [Note 4] More specifically, Munshani suggests that his conduct did not amount to a fraud on the court because: (1) it was an isolated instance of perjury, rather than an "unconscionable scheme"; (2) his conduct "had absolutely no impact on the trier of fact"; and (3) his conduct did not unfairly hamper the presentation of the defendants' claims or defenses.	 


Page 718


 	      2. Discussion. The judge characterized Munshani's conduct as intentional fabrication, gross abuse of the court and the parties, tampering with the fair administration of justice, and disrespectful. His conclusion that Munshani had committed a "fraud on the court" was based on a definition appearing in Rockdale Mgmt. Co. v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., 418 Mass. 596 , 598 (1994), citing Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 246 (1944). We examine the judge's analysis of Munshani's conduct as "fraud on the court," and conclude that the judge was justified in concluding the conduct was fraudulent, and was within his discretion in imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal. We also note that the sanction was appropriate in the circumstances even without any necessity of equating Munshani's conduct with the technical definition of "fraud on the court." In brief, the judge, in the exercise of inherent powers, acted within his discretion in ordering dismissal.	 




 	      a. Fraud on the court. "Fraud on the court implies corrupt conduct and embraces 'only that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself.' " Winthrop Corp. v. Lowenthal, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 180 , 184 (1990), quoting from Pina v. McGill Dev. Corp., 388 Mass. 159 , 165 (1983). Fraud on the court involves the most egregious misconduct, Winthrop Corp. v. Lowenthal, supra, and that misconduct may be by parties as well as by their attorneys, see MacDonald v. MacDonald, 407 Mass. 196 , 201 n.9 (1990). The court in Rockdale adopted the definition of fraud on the court as detailed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir. 1989): "A 'fraud on the court' occurs where it can be demonstrated, clearly and convincingly, that a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party's claim or defense." Rockdale Mgmt. Co. v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., 418 Mass. at 598, quoting from Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d  at 1118. The court in Rockdale also stated:	 




 	"When a fraud on the court is shown through clear and 


Page 719


convincing evidence to have been committed in an ongoing case, the trial judge has the inherent power to take action in response to the fraudulent conduct. [Note 5] The judge has broad discretion to fashion a judicial response warranted by the fraudulent conduct. Dismissal of claims or of an entire action may be warranted . . . as may be the entry of a default judgment. We examine judicial responses to findings of fraud on the court for an abuse of discretion."	 




Rockdale Mgmt. Co. v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., supra. (Citations omitted.) [Note 6]




 	      In the present case, the record, including the expert's comprehensive report, convincingly establishes that Munshani set in motion an unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the court's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter in accordance with applicable rules. The judge properly determined that Munshani engaged in the scheme and attempted to deceive two courts. Munshani's conduct was not limited only to the fabrication of the disputed e-mail, or its submission to the court with a false affidavit, but included several months of additional charade, attempting to hide the fabrication. The judge was justified in concluding that Munshani's fraud amounted to an unconscionable scheme to deceive the court.	 




 	      Examination of the complaint, the defendants' answers (including amended counterclaims), the relationships between the parties in the Federal action and those in the State action, and the nature of both State and Federal claims involving alleged oral agreements against which the defendants interposed a Statute of Frauds defense, makes clear to us that Munshani's conduct, as well as the falsified documents, were not "collateral" to the State court proceeding. Pretrial discovery, in our view, is not "collateral" when part of substantial litigation. Furthermore, the defendants' assertion that the parties' credibility was the centerpiece to this litigation appears justified in the record.	 


Page 720


 	      The judge also fairly could conclude that Munshani's behavior was calculated to influence the judge's determination of requested pretrial discovery orders, with the intended result being a hampered presentation of the defendants' defenses and counterclaims. For example, the judge found that Munshani fabricated evidence and caused his lawyer to submit the fabricated evidence in successful opposition to a motion to dismiss his companion Federal action, and to submit to both the Federal court and the State court an affidavit attesting to the authenticity of the fabricated e-mail. In support of their motion to preserve electronic evidence and expedite discovery, the defendants submitted an expert's affidavit asserting that the e-mail was fraudulent. Munshani still admitted nothing, but suggested that the judge appoint an independent expert, insisting that he had been "wrongly and irresponsibly accused" of "perpetrating a fraud." In sum, Munshani sought to gain tactical advantages against the defendants "while simultaneously throwing a large monkey wrench into the judicial machinery." Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d  at 1118.	 




 	      While Munshani claims that his conduct "had absolutely no impact on the trier of fact," the judge made specific note that the conduct "set in motion a number of hearings and a detailed investigation by the Court's appointed expert" and that the court and the defendants were "made dupes to his actions" and "spent countless hours trying to sort out [the fraud]." The judge also found that "[h]ad Munshani succeeded with his fraud, he could have dramatically changed the face of the case . . . to the serious detriment of the defendants and the Court as well."	 




 	      We hold that the judge properly found that Munshani had committed a fraud on the court irrespective of whether his conduct comported in all technical detail with the few available definitions of such fraud, although we nevertheless hold that it did. The judge's memorandum reveals thoughtful consideration of the difficulty of uncovering sophisticated computer fraud and the need to deter future attempts by litigants to avail themselves of what might otherwise be viewed as a low-risk means of gaining an advantage in high stakes litigation. As the trial court judge pointed out:	 




 	"All courts are at the mercy of litigants and their advocates 


Page 721


. . . in the often difficult search for truth. The ability to discover fraud in the process, particularly sophisticated computer fraud, is greatly limited. Thus, the imposition of strong sanctions is one of the very few ways of deterring such activity in the future. This Court intends such a message here."	 




 	      b. Dismissal as sanction. The ultimate sanction of dismissal is not limited to instances of behavior that are technically defined as fraud on the court. See Enlace Mercantil Internacional, Inc. v. Senior Indus., Inc., 848 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir. 1988) (delay can constitute extreme misconduct justifying dismissal); Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996) (range of circumstances where court has authority to dismiss case is so vast as to "defy mechanical rules"); Tower Ventures, Inc. v. Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002) (dismissal affirmed where zoning applicant repeatedly failed to comply with discovery scheduling order for no good reason).	 




 	      "Courts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation, with power to impose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission to their lawful mandates." Anderson v. Dunn, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 204, 227 (1821). These powers are "governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases." Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-631 (1962).	 




 	      Here, the judge's utilization of the dismissal sanction was not only appropriate on the facts of this case, but was a realistic measure undertaken to protect the integrity of the pending litigation and the Superior Court, as well as to send an appropriate message to those who would so abuse the courts of the Commonwealth. To limit, as Munshani suggests, punishment for such conduct to repayment of the costs of uncovering the fraud could actually encourage similar fraud in other high stakes cases. A devious litigant might embark on a scheme to engage in complex electronic fraud calculating the possibility that, even if caught, he or she could simply pay the bill and proceed with the litigation. The judge here imposed a sanction that allowed zero tolerance for sophisticated computer fraud and evidence tampering. That sanction was within the judge's discretion.	 


Page 722


 	      Munshani devotes much of his brief to arguing that the judge failed to apply the proper factors before invoking the sanction of dismissal in this case. Specifically, Munshani argues that the judge should have, but did not, consider the five specific factors discussed by this court in Keene v. Brigham & Women's Hosp., Inc., 56 Mass. App. Ct. 10 , 21 (2002), S.C., 439 Mass. 223  (2003). That case concerned the entry of a default as a sanction for the defendants' failure to produce lost records pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C), as amended,  390 Mass. 1208  (1984). The flaw in Munshani's analysis is that the Keene factors applied to sanctions for nonwilful failure to comply with discovery orders, i.e., to records that had been lost, not the significantly more egregious type of conduct which is at issue in this case. Dismissal, an admittedly drastic sanction to be utilized only in extreme situations, see Monahan v. Washburn, 400 Mass. 126 , 128 (1987), was warranted here.	 




 	Judgment affirmed.
