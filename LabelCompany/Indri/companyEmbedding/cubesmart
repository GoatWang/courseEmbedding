I've been to quite a few storage facilities over the years and this one is, by far, the best! The staff was so friendly and helpful, the grounds were incredibly clean and the process smooth. I would definitely recommend them to anyone I know that is looking to store.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Warrenton, VA


I've been to a number of storage facilities throughout the years. Not one of them can match CubeSmart as far as cleanliness, security, and in many other areas. The rates are highly competitive, I've even had an associate move into the same facility after visiting my unit.

I have used quite a few storage facilities in my time, and CubeSmart is the best one yet. The units and the grounds were very clean. The personal have been extremely nice and professional.

— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Columbus, OH


I have never used a self storage facility before and was very concerned about the safety, cleanliness and accessibility of a facility. I researched facilities and prices online and visited each facility on my "short list". I chose CubeSmart because of the competitive prices, the cleanliness of the building, storage space, and accessibility to my belongings. What really won me over? The friendliness of the staff. I really felt that they tried hard to get me the right space at the right price. They are always available to help and answer questions.

    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH

Choice of law and venue:
This Agreement and the relationship between you and CubeSmart shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and CubeSmart agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Chester County, Pennsylvania.
Notices:
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, CubeSmart may provide notice to you via email, regular mail, or posting notices or links to notices on the Site.
Amendment:
CubeSmart may change this Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, the Copyright Infringement Notice Policy, and the Trademark Usage Guidelines, at any time, effective immediately. You understand that CubeSmart reserves the right to make these changes and that you are responsible for regularly reviewing these terms. Your continued access to or use of the Site after any change will constitute your consent to the change. In some cases, if in the reasonable view of CubeSmart, a change to this Agreement (including to the Privacy Policy, Copyright Infringement Notice Policy, or Trademark Usage Guidelines) constitutes a material change, such a change will not take effect until 30 days after notice is provided by email, posting to the Site, or otherwise, during which time you may notify us that you do not accept the change. Your continued use of the Site after such 30 day period will mean that you accept any such change. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that change or improve the Site will be subject to this Agreement, as modified from time to time. No modification of this Agreement will be binding on CubeSmart unless posted by CubeSmart, or unless adopted in writing and signed by someone authorized to act on behalf of CubeSmart.
Termination:
CubeSmart reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend, or terminate the Site (or any part thereof), with or without notice. CubeSmart will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or termination of all or any portion of the Site, or loss of related information. CubeSmart reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate or restrict your access to and use of the Site, or any part of the Site, without notice, for any or no reason, and without liability to you or any third party. The portions of this Agreement relating to Intellectual Property Rights, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, and Choice of Law and Venue, and all terms of this Agreement which by their nature should survive, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
General Terms:
You may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any right granted hereunder. You agree that any material breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to CubeSmart for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, CubeSmart will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if CubeSmart seeks such an injunction.
Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under this Agreement will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
CubeSmart’s performance under this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of CubeSmart’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by CubeSmart with respect to such use.
A printed version of this Agreement and of any notices given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

Interactive Signage Improves Customer Experience with Consistent Product, Service and Brand Messaging at More than 350 Self-Storage LocationsTouchscreen Displays Give Customers Quick, Easy Reference for Determining Self-Storage and Logistics SolutionsKitchen remodeling, kid off to college, recreational toys, and even business inventory can all require one thing – storage space. These days, however, simply offering secure, temperature-controlled units at a fair price is no longer the key to winning customers and their loyalty. The pendulum has swung back to a customer service focus; a principle that is a number one priority for CubeSmartsm (NYSE: CUBE), a leader in the $20+ billion self-storage industry. A re-evaluation of strategies just over a year ago led the company to shift its focus from simple storage, to offering a full menu of services and amenities to meet the growing and changing trends of individual and business customers. With stores in 26 states (as well as the District of Columbia), the challenge for CubeSmart was how to present this expanded menu of product offerings while at the same time provide a consistent customer experience with each location, and ensure identical brand messaging and product/service information nationwide.

Cubesmart - Unethical business practices




                                    Cubesmart is an unethical predatory self-storage company. First they hit you with an unlisted insurance fee which is 15% on top of a monthly rate. Then they sneakily increase rates on customers who have a contract with them in the hopes it goes unnoticed. If a consumer...

Cubesmart - No help after break in 




                                    Our storage unit was broken into and about $6000 of things were stolen, mainly tools. We did get a call after it was discovered that our lock was missing but the manager refuses to view the video tapes. She said she sent the logins to her manager and that is all she...

Cubesmart - Need to feel important perhaps?




                                    Made a reservation at the Cube Smart freeway location in Kyle, Texas. Upon arriving to secure my storage unit, it was apparent that the climate control I thought I had reserved was indeed NOT a climate control, so the manager suggested the location on Go Forth Rd. She...

Cubesmart - Poor customer service at Garner Lane, Columbia, SC location




                                    On 6/13/2017 I reserved online (2) 5x10 units to inspect by 6/21/2017. One was climate controlled and the other wasn't. A person named Laferrel(?) from this Garner Lane Cubesmart called and left a message on my voicemail as I'm on vacation. I called Laferrel back that...

Cubesmart - Rates keep increasing




                                    We have had the same unit since October 2015. The rates have increased twice in that time. We have a 10x15 non-climate controlled unit. Our rates started about $146 then up to $176 a month now and it is not like we cost them any thing. We also find palmetto bugs and...

Cubesmart - Rate increase right after they lured me in w/promotional pricing





 




                                    I had been with my storage company for almost 2 years before Cubesmart bought them out. I never once got a rate increase. After they were in they said if I changed units I would get they're promotional pricing. So after I went thru the time & trouble of hauling...

                            I hired Pick Up Movers for my move a few weeks ago. They were just amazing. Most of the times when you hire a moving company, promises are never kept. Not in the case with this company though. When I called them for a quote, they seemed very sincere and gave me a very reasonable quote. Their crew arrived very much on time on the moving day. All four men were very sincere and skilled. I have a lot of stuffs but they didnt take a long time to...                        Read more

                            The process started out fine. I worked with Andrew in the sales department and he assured me repeatedly that they always overestimate the weight of everything so that there are no "surprises". So imagine my *surprise* when the QA agent called to review everything with me and let me know that what I described to Andrew as 8 foot tall bookcases were entered as "small bookshelves" and a large living room armchair was a "wooden chair".

Extra Space Storage


                            My unit was sold out from under me. They did not send notice of the auction. I had previously sent them a change of phone number, multiple times, but they did not update the phone number; they just used the old phone number. Common sense is that if phone number does not work, then you would make an extra effort to contact by mail. My address was correct, I know this, because I received notice of a rent increase. I have (had) 15 years of memories...                        Read more

Cleaning Tips
Baby-Safe Cleaning Products
2 months agoby Editor @CubeSmartAdd Comment67 Views


Keeping kids safe and secure is a priority for every parent, but it isn’t always easy to know where to focus your energy. Since cleaning products and harsh chemicals present a danger to curious kids of all ages, this is a smart place to start. Replace common chemicals with these six baby-safe cleaning products, and create a worry-free home for your family.
Kid-friendly all-purpose cleaners

Image via Bigstock
When your busy schedule doesn’t include much spare time for cleaning, an effective all-purpose cleaner should be at the top of your list. This type of product can get just about any surface clean, leaving your home sanitized and safe for kids.
Since your little ones will inevitably come into contact with these surfaces, you’ll want to make all-natural cleaning products a priority. Skip the harsh products you can buy at the store and go natural instead. Sprinkle baking soda on countertops and other surfaces, and scrub gently with a damp sponge. Add a little white vinegar or some table salt to tackle tough stains.
Safe Bathroom and Kitchen Cleaners
When it comes to keeping the bathroom and kitchen tidy, using cleaning products safe for baby is essential. After all, commercial tub, tile, and toilet cleaners are packed with chemicals that are dangerous to ingest and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are harmful to inhale.
Rather than using harsh chemicals, opt for baby-friendly cleaning products instead. The white vinegar that you use to clean stubborn surfaces can also fight mold in the bathroom. The plain baking soda that you sprinkle on countertops also works on the tub and the shower. To clean the toilet without potentially toxic chemicals, use castile soap instead. This mild soap is plant-based and totally safe for baby.
Floor Cleaners
When your little ones start to crawl and explore on their own, you’ll want to make sure that the floors are as clean as possible. Try baby-safe household cleaners from brands like Eco-Me, which will clean your floors and eliminate bacteria without introducing harsh chemicals into your home.
If you’d rather go natural, try using a mixture of castile soap and warm water to clean up messes. You can even add a hint of shine with a one-to-one ratio of white vinegar and vegetable oil.
Best baby friendly laundry products
As your family grows, you’ll quickly have more laundry than you ever thought possible. In some cases, those piles of dirty clothes will be messier than you thought possible, too. While you might be tempted to use industrial-strength laundry detergent to keep your kids’ clothes clean and sanitary, keep in mind that many harsh products can irritate your baby’s sensitive skin.
Keep the little ones happy and your laundry piles manageable with the best baby-safe household cleaners. Try a baby-friendly laundry detergent that’s fragrance-free and has minimal ingredients, like Biokleen. This eco-friendly detergent is ideal for sensitive skin and eczema, and it’s available in economy-size dispensers to make your laundry routine easier.
Dishwashing Liquids
When it comes to choosing cleaning products safe for baby, you’ll want to pay special care to the dishwashing liquids that you use. Not only can harsh dishwashing products release nasty chemicals into the air and affect baby’s breathing passages, but these items also linger on bottles, plates, and flatware.
As a general rule, avoid harsh dishwashing products that contain antibacterial ingredients like triclosan. These substances are believed to be carcinogenic and can also contribute to antibiotic resistance, so they’re chemicals to keep far away from your little ones.
Instead of commercial-grade cleaners, choose natural dishwashing liquids. Better Life Dish Soap skips the synthetic fragrances, and Eco-Me Dish Soap cleans effectively without harsh ingredients.
Child-safe air fresheners
Little ones are known for making messes, and over time, this can lead to a smelly house. While it’s easy to drown out unpleasant odors with spray bottles of commercial-grade air fresheners, this could have detrimental effects on the whole family’s health. Rather than buying air fresheners at the supermarket, try making them at home. When you use only natural ingredients, you can rest assured that you have cleaning products safe for children of all ages.
Try absorbing odors with natural products like cat litter or coffee grounds. Pour these materials in small bowls around the house, and be sure to place them relatively high so curious fingers won’t cause them to spill. If you want to purify the air, add a few small palm trees and other green houseplants to your interior decor. These plants will brighten your home while pulling harmful household chemicals from the air supply.
When you want to keep your children safe, removing hazards from your home is essential. Shift breakables and other potentially dangerous items to a household storage unit, and phase out harmful cleaning products. When you follow these tips, you’ll give yourself peace of mind knowing that your home is clean and safe.

Cubesmart - Unethical business practices

Cubesmart is an unethical predatory self-storage company.First they hit you with an unlisted insurance fee which is 15% on top of a monthly rate.
Then they sneakily increase rates on customers who have a contract with them in the hopes it goes unnoticed. If a consumer agrees to a rate and signs a contract for that rate, that should be honored. Increasing that rate every 6mo to by 15% is a pathetic business practice. Avoid this company at all costs.
Hopefully the market will see their deception and tank their stock price.
Their chief executive should be put in jail for screwing the common person.Worse than Comcast. 

            I didn't like:
                                                Pricing,                                                                 Mandatory insurance,                                                                 There customer service is poor,                                                                 Predatory price increases,                                                                 Dishonesty.                                    
 




 


        Review #1077351 is a subjective opinion of
                    poster.

Pick Up Movers


                            I hired Pick Up Movers for my move a few weeks ago. They were just amazing. Most of the times when you hire a moving company, promises are never kept. Not in the case with this company though. When I called them for a quote, they seemed very sincere and gave me a very reasonable quote. Their crew arrived very much on time on the moving day. All four men were very sincere and skilled. I have a lot of stuffs but they didnt take a long time to...                        Read more

Colonial Van Lines










                    1 of 1                


                            The process started out fine. I worked with Andrew in the sales department and he assured me repeatedly that they always overestimate the weight of everything so that there are no "surprises". So imagine my *surprise* when the QA agent called to review everything with me and let me know that what I described to Andrew as 8 foot tall bookcases were entered as "small bookshelves" and a large living room armchair was a "wooden chair". End result?...                        Read more

Extra Space Storage


                            My unit was sold out from under me. They did not send notice of the auction. I had previously sent them a change of phone number, multiple times, but they did not update the phone number; they just used the old phone number. Common sense is that if phone number does not work, then you would make an extra effort to contact by mail. My address was correct, I know this, because I received notice of a rent increase. I have (had) 15 years of memories...                        Read more

                Pick Up Movers - Hiring them was the best decision

Pick Up Movers


                            I hired Pick Up Movers for my move a few weeks ago. They were just amazing. Most of the times when you hire a moving company, promises are never kept. Not in the case with this company though. When I called them for a quote, they seemed very sincere and gave me a very reasonable quote. Their crew arrived very much on time on the moving day. All four men were very sincere and skilled. I have a lot of stuffs but they didnt take a long time to...                        Read more


 



                Colonial Van Lines - Do yourself a favor and just rent a POD

Colonial Van Lines










                    1 of 1                


                            The process started out fine. I worked with Andrew in the sales department and he assured me repeatedly that they always overestimate the weight of everything so that there are no "surprises". So imagine my *surprise* when the QA agent called to review everything with me and let me know that what I described to Andrew as 8 foot tall bookcases were entered as "small bookshelves" and a large living room armchair was a "wooden chair". End result?...                        Read more


 



                Extra Space Storage - Went to auction, no notice given

Extra Space Storage


                            My unit was sold out from under me. They did not send notice of the auction. I had previously sent them a change of phone number, multiple times, but they did not update the phone number; they just used the old phone number. Common sense is that if phone number does not work, then you would make an extra effort to contact by mail. My address was correct, I know this, because I received notice of a rent increase. I have (had) 15 years of memories...                        Read more

I've been to quite a few storage facilities over the years and this one is, by far, the best! The staff was so friendly and helpful, the grounds were incredibly clean and the process smooth. I would definitely recommend them to anyone I know that is looking to store.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Warrenton, VA


I've been to a number of storage facilities throughout the years. Not one of them can match CubeSmart as far as cleanliness, security, and in many other areas. The rates are highly competitive, I've even had an associate move into the same facility after visiting my unit.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Sanford, FL


I have used quite a few storage facilities in my time, and CubeSmart is the best one yet. The units and the grounds were very clean. The personal have been extremely nice and professional.

My husband and I have moved around many times to different parts of town and we have to move storage units every time. This is by far the BEST one we have used. The workers are so nice and it's so easy to pay my bill. Really grateful we came here!
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Tucson, AZ


I've had a few self-storage units over the years, depending on where I have lived, and CubeSmart has truly been the best experience, yet! Their customer service, friendliness, security features, and everything else overall has made me glad that with this last move, a CubeSmart was the most convenient self-storage facility!
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of El Paso, TX

— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Columbus, OH


I have never used a self storage facility before and was very concerned about the safety, cleanliness and accessibility of a facility. I researched facilities and prices online and visited each facility on my "short list". I chose CubeSmart because of the competitive prices, the cleanliness of the building, storage space, and accessibility to my belongings. What really won me over? The friendliness of the staff. I really felt that they tried hard to get me the right space at the right price. They are always available to help and answer questions.
— Customer of CubeSmart Self Storage of Boston, MA

    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH
