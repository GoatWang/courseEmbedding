Telemedicine Software











An Introduction to Telemedicine Software
Many patients face obstacles that make it difficult for them to commit the necessary time and resources to seeing their provider on a regular basis. The use of telemedicine software reduces the burden on patients by eliminating time away from work, childcare concerns, and travel time and costs.

















What is Telemedicine Software?
The term “health information technology” (health IT) is a broad concept that includes an array of technologies to store, share, and analyze health information. Telemedicine is a subset of health IT that encompasses the use of technology to deliver clinical healthcare via secure video and audio connections.
Telemedicine software is the platform used by providers to connect with patients, and share video and images. It can be integrated with a provider’s electronic health record and scheduling systems.
 















Why is Telemedicine Important?
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, about 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. While this is great news for those who now have access to health care, it does put additional strain on an already taxed system. Telehealth software is one way to service more patients in less time and to reduce the overhead of patient check in and waiting areas.
In addition, the population of elderly and chronically ill patients is growing quickly. That’s why 24 states have enacted telemedicine reinbursement parity laws and several others have legislation pending.

The Core Components of Telemedicine Software
While there are a number of different telemedicine software solutions on the market and the features they offer vary, the best solutions include the following key capabilities.





EHR/PM Integration
Providers want telemedicine software that adds a new way to deliver services without adding additional complexity. EHR/PM integration makes it easy to add video visits to the mix without additional friction.
 
Mobile App for Patients
The object of telemedicine software is to make it as easy as possible for patients to get the care they need from anywhere. That’s why it is important to provide both a mobile app and the ability to use a browser. Patients can connect in the way that is easiest for them, wherever they are.
 
Eligibility Verification
Providers need assurance that they will be reimbursed for each visit conducted via video. That’s why the most comprehensive telemedicine software includes a rules engine to verify payment eligibility when the appointment is scheduled.
 
HIPAA Compliant Video
Not all video connections are secure enough to provide the patient confidentiality protections required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That’s one of the many reasons that providers are choosing purpose-built telemedicine technology, rather than consumer grade video conferencing options like Facetime or Skype–these solutions are not HIPAA-compliant video conferencing solutions.
 
Custom Branding
The ability to brand your telemedicine app with the look and logo that your patients associate with your practice gives them piece of mind that they are getting the same level of care that they’ve come to expect from your team.
 
Built-in Support
No matter how easy-to-use telemedicine software can be, no doubt there will be questions from time to time. That’s why practices should choose technology that includes in-app support for real-time issue resolution.









The Benefits of Telemedicine Software for Providers
The benefits of video visits for patients are obvious, but how do they provide an advantage for providers?





Efficiency
The option to see patients via video makes practices more efficient by reducing the number of people in the waiting area and the burden on administrative staff. When well executed, video visits can make it possible for providers to see more patients in a day.
 
Better Health Outcomes
Eliminating the barrier of transportation increases likelihood that patient treatment will be successful because it is easier to follow through with telemedicine follow-up visits.





Flexibility
Because both the provider and the patient can be anywhere during a visit using telemedicine technology, providers have increased flexibility when and from where to see patients. Office hours can be expanded or made more flexible.
 
Fewer No-Shows and Last Minute Cancellations
With video visits, transportation, child-care and work related issues are less likely to keep patients from keeping the appointment.

Product





















































Chiron Health is the only platform designed to get physician practices fully reimbursed for routine follow-up visits over video chat. We enable practices to convert unpaid follow-up phone calls into billable telemedicine encounters—each provider can generate incremental revenue of $2-3k per month.Why aren’t practices already doing this? Complicated state medical board and HIPAA compliance, and… · More difficult reimbursement—the technology has been there for a long time.Our experienced compliance team handles these regulatory complexities that the vast majority of practices are simply not equipped to handle on their own. We even check the insurance eligibility of patients using a proprietary database of telemedicine insurance rules—no one else is doing this.Simply put, Chiron Health is the only company to offer a telemedicine solution for the outpatient setting that actually makes economic sense for physician practices—and our early customers are already making a lot of money doing it.

About Us



Home / About Us 












Chiron Health Products is an Australian owned family business founded by research scientist Dr. Natalie Alexopoulos. She is a neuroscientist and early development biologist who strongly believes a good start to life is as important as maintaining optimum health throughout life.
For this reason, Chiron are developing products that use only the purest and freshest ingredients.
All oils are made from hand harvested ingredients, grown without the use of chemicals or pesticides. Because our products are made in small batches, each herb is picked and the oils made close to the production date.
Unfortunately many other products which claim to be natural use synthetic essential oils or only minute amounts of pure oil with a large amount of harsh chemicals that harm the skin as well as the environment.
 Our name …
      Chiron

… literally means hand and pays tribute to Ancient Greek centaur, Chiron, who was a great healer and teacher to many heroes such as Asclepius, Achilles, Jason and Hercules.
When the immortal Chiron was accidentally shot with a poison arrow from Hercules, he was in agony but could not die. Chiron exchanged his life for that of Prometheus whom Zeus had imprisoned for giving the gift of fire to man.
Chiron embodied the spirit of compassion and selfless service that is imperative in medicine and healing.
So powerful has been his influence that today many words have their roots in his name:

Chiral means the polarization of light from one hand to another
Chiromancy is reading of the hand or palmistry
Chiropractic is healing of joints and bones by manipulation, and
Chirurgery is an ancient word which later became surgery

Chiron Organic Farm
Our beautiful farm is located on 32 acres near Bendigo in Victoria.
Here we are able to lovingly tend to our plants, herbs and olive grove to provide the ingredients for our products.
Everything is hand harvested and pesticides are never used.
Our ingredients are plant based and 100% natural, so they are also environmentally friendly. We have a respect for nature and want all future generations to enjoy it as well.

Chiron's vaccines and blood testing units were combined to form Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, while Chiron BioPharmaceuticals was integrated into Novartis Pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Novartis completed the sale of its blood transfusion diagnostics unit ("Novartis Diagnostics") to Grifols, S.A. (Barcelona, Spain) and announced agreements for the sale of its vaccines unit ("Novartis Vaccines") to GSK Vaccines[1].

Early history[edit]
Chiron (/ˈkaɪˌrɒn/ KY-rɑn after the centaur from Greek mythology)[2] was founded in 1981 by chairman, William J. Rutter, president and chief executive, Professor Edward Penhoet, and vice president for research, Pablo DT Valenzuela. All were academics from the University of California; Penhoet at Berkeley, where he continued to lecture, and the others from San Francisco.[2] Chiron formed a partnership with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Ciba-Geigy Ltd.,[2] through the Biocine Company,[3][4] to use genetic engineering to develop vaccines and to treat, prevent and diagnose diseases such as AIDS, herpes and malaria.[2][5] Other partnerships included Thicon Inc. to develop a growth factor hormone for the treatment of wounds and Merck & Co to develop an improvement to their existing hepatitis B vaccine.[2] In 1986, Professor Penhoet said: "Our business strategy is to dominate small markets rather than take a small presence in a broad market." The niche that Chiron was focusing on was ophthalmology, which Mr. Penhoet said was "big enough to be interesting, but small enough to service with 40 salespeople."[2] Professor Penhoet also stated that Chiron was set up to provide the enabling technology for others to use under license,[2] and later saying that Chiron was "as close to a virtual corporation as you can be", with few fixed assets but more relationships.[6]
Expansion[edit]
In 1988, Chiron formed a joint venture company, called Mimesys Inc., with Johnson & Johnson and the Warner-Lambert Company, to develop the next generation of biotech drugs.[7] The following year Chiron recruited Gregory Lawless, who had come from DuPont, to take over as president and CEO.[8] This led to additional buying that included the acquisition of Du Pont in partnership with Ortho Diagnostic Systems;[9] Munich based Adatomed GmbH;[10] and a merger with fellow biotech company Cetus Corporation[11] after Cetus failed to get approval for its drug Interleukin-2.[12] Hollings Renton of Cetus became president and CEO when Gregory Lawless agreed to leave.[3] Mr Renton resigned in 1992[13] and was replaced by Sean Lance, from Glaxo Wellcome in 1998,[14] and finally by Howard Pien from GlaxoSmithKline in 2003.[15] After the acquisition of Cetus, Chiron split its operations among five entities: Cetus Oncology, for cancer drugs; the Biocine Company, for vaccines; Chiron Diagnostics, for blood screening and other diagnostic tests (later sold to Bayer AG for $1.1 billion[16]); Chiron Intraoptics, for eye surgery, and Chiron Technologies, for research and development.[6]
Products and other acquisitions[edit]
In 1992, the company's first product, Proleukin, was approved in United States for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; previously it was only approved for use with kidney cancer.[17] This was followed a year later by Betaseron, a beta interferon, the first treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and made by Berlex Laboratories Inc.[18][19] In 1997 Chiron provided the active ingredient, becaplermin, in Regranex, a topical treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, manufactured by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc.[20] In 2001, Chiron acquired PathoGenesis for its antibiotic drug Tobi,[21] the first inhaled antibiotic approved for treating lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.[22] Having launched its first vaccine product, Fluad, an adjuvant influenza vaccine, in 1996, the vaccine line was expanded significantly in 1998 with the acquisition of the European vaccine businesses of Behring (Germany) and Sclavo (Italy). This was followed in 2003 by the acquisition of PowderJect, the UK-based vaccines company, making Chiron the second-largest flu vaccines provider and the fifth-largest vaccines business in the world.[23][24] In 1998, Chiron's nucleic acid testing (NAT) blood-testing business was launched in cooperation with Gen-Probe, followed a year later by the launch of the Procleix system, which detects viral RNA and DNA in donated blood and plasma during the very early stages of infection, when those infectious agents are present but cannot be detected by immunodiagnostic tests. Chiron expanded its cancer drug portfolio in 2002 with the acquisition of Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc and its product tezacitebine.[25] Chiron also manufactured the MMR vaccine (measles mumps and rubella) at its Liverpool plant.[26] Chiron in conjunction with Crucell (now part of Johnson & Johnson) developed a pentavalent vaccine called Quinvaxem targeting 5 diseases in children.
Lawsuits[edit]
When in 1991 Cetus was acquired it was subject to a lawsuit by the Eastman Kodak Company over the rights to the polymerase chain reaction product, which was settled in 1993.[19] In 1998, Chiron filed patent infringement suits in Europe, Japan and the US against Roche over its hepatitis C (HCV) products. Chiron was the first to clone HCV in 1987 after five years of research and had since filed over 100 HCV related patents in over 20 countries.[27] A settlement was reached where Roche Holding A.G. agreed to buy the global semi-exclusive nucleic acid test (NAT) patents for HCV and HIV from Chiron.[21] Bayer, the company which bought Chiron Diagnostics, sued Chiron Corporation in 2002 citing that it hid patent and equipment problems from them during purchase negotiations.[28] The case filed in Delaware alleged breach of warranty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract claims in connection with the acquisition.[29] In 2004, Chiron attracted adverse media coverage after the UK government suspended its license for manufacturing Fluvirin, an influenza vaccine, at its plant in Liverpool, England. This action left the United States government short of the vaccine. It later emerged that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may have been aware of the problem nine months earlier, but a miscommunication between the company and the FDA left the problem unsolved until the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency), the British equivalent of the FDA stepped in and suspended Chiron's license.[30] The company undertook a remediation program and succeeded in restoring the manufacturing license from MHRA in 2005. However, the incident resulted in a class action lawsuit for nearly $280m being brought against Chiron and its executive for allegedly, in 2003, overstating its ability to manufacture and ship the vaccine Fluvirin, thus allowing Novartis to buy Chiron shares below market value when the plant temporarily closed down. The amount settled in 2008 was for $30m.[31]
Bombings[edit]
On August 27, 2003 two bombs exploded at Chiron's headquarters in Emeryville, California.[32] A group calling itself Revolutionary Cells e-mailed a statement to reporters taking credit for the bombing and claimed that their action was due to Chiron's past contracts with Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract research firm that conducts experiments on animals. The FBI has named Daniel Andreas San Diego as the lead suspect and placed him on its FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list.[33][34]
The end of Chiron[edit]
Novartis Corporation was the result of a merger between Sandoz Laboratories and Ciba-Geigy in 1996 and owned slightly less than half of Chiron[35] as part of a Federal Trade Commission order.[36] Several of Sandoz’s subsidiaries were sold off for reasons of anti monopoly legislation.[36] In 2005, Novartis made an offer to buy Chiron. Initially this offer was rebuffed, but after the bid was substantially enhanced, Chiron was sold, and became part of Novartis in April, 2006.[37] A year later, parts of ex-Chiron were sold in part and leased in part to Bayer.[38] In 2011 Bayer announced it was withdrawing from a manufacturing plant it had leased from Novartis.[39] and Novartis finally divested most of the former Chiron assets in 2013 as part of a global reorganization.[40]

Chiron Corporation was an American multinational biotechnology firm based in Emeryville, California that was acquired by Novartis International AG on April 20, 2006. It had offices and facilities in eighteen countries on five continents. Chiron's business and research was in three main areas: biopharmaceuticals, vaccines, and blood testing. Chiron's vaccines and blood testing units were combined to form Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, while Chiron BioPharmaceuticals was integrated into Novartis Pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Novartis completed the sale of its blood transfusion diagnostics unit ("Novartis Diagnostics") to Grifols, S.A. (Barcelona, Spain) and announced agreements for the sale of its vaccines unit ("Novartis Vaccines") to GSK Vaccines[1].

Early history[edit]
Chiron (/ˈkaɪˌrɒn/ KY-rɑn after the centaur from Greek mythology)[2] was founded in 1981 by chairman, William J. Rutter, president and chief executive, Professor Edward Penhoet, and vice president for research, Pablo DT Valenzuela. All were academics from the University of California; Penhoet at Berkeley, where he continued to lecture, and the others from San Francisco.[2] Chiron formed a partnership with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Ciba-Geigy Ltd.,[2] through the Biocine Company,[3][4] to use genetic engineering to develop vaccines and to treat, prevent and diagnose diseases such as AIDS, herpes and malaria.[2][5] Other partnerships included Thicon Inc. to develop a growth factor hormone for the treatment of wounds and Merck & Co to develop an improvement to their existing hepatitis B vaccine.[2] In 1986, Professor Penhoet said: "Our business strategy is to dominate small markets rather than take a small presence in a broad market." The niche that Chiron was focusing on was ophthalmology, which Mr. Penhoet said was "big enough to be interesting, but small enough to service with 40 salespeople."[2] Professor Penhoet also stated that Chiron was set up to provide the enabling technology for others to use under license,[2] and later saying that Chiron was "as close to a virtual corporation as you can be", with few fixed assets but more relationships.[6]
Expansion[edit]
In 1988, Chiron formed a joint venture company, called Mimesys Inc., with Johnson & Johnson and the Warner-Lambert Company, to develop the next generation of biotech drugs.[7] The following year Chiron recruited Gregory Lawless, who had come from DuPont, to take over as president and CEO.[8] This led to additional buying that included the acquisition of Du Pont in partnership with Ortho Diagnostic Systems;[9] Munich based Adatomed GmbH;[10] and a merger with fellow biotech company Cetus Corporation[11] after Cetus failed to get approval for its drug Interleukin-2.[12] Hollings Renton of Cetus became president and CEO when Gregory Lawless agreed to leave.[3] Mr Renton resigned in 1992[13] and was replaced by Sean Lance, from Glaxo Wellcome in 1998,[14] and finally by Howard Pien from GlaxoSmithKline in 2003.[15] After the acquisition of Cetus, Chiron split its operations among five entities: Cetus Oncology, for cancer drugs; the Biocine Company, for vaccines; Chiron Diagnostics, for blood screening and other diagnostic tests (later sold to Bayer AG for $1.1 billion[16]); Chiron Intraoptics, for eye surgery, and Chiron Technologies, for research and development.[6]
Products and other acquisitions[edit]
In 1992, the company's first product, Proleukin, was approved in United States for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; previously it was only approved for use with kidney cancer.[17] This was followed a year later by Betaseron, a beta interferon, the first treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and made by Berlex Laboratories Inc.[18][19] In 1997 Chiron provided the active ingredient, becaplermin, in Regranex, a topical treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, manufactured by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc.[20] In 2001, Chiron acquired PathoGenesis for its antibiotic drug Tobi,[21] the first inhaled antibiotic approved for treating lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.[22] Having launched its first vaccine product, Fluad, an adjuvant influenza vaccine, in 1996, the vaccine line was expanded significantly in 1998 with the acquisition of the European vaccine businesses of Behring (Germany) and Sclavo (Italy). This was followed in 2003 by the acquisition of PowderJect, the UK-based vaccines company, making Chiron the second-largest flu vaccines provider and the fifth-largest vaccines business in the world.[23][24] In 1998, Chiron's nucleic acid testing (NAT) blood-testing business was launched in cooperation with Gen-Probe, followed a year later by the launch of the Procleix system, which detects viral RNA and DNA in donated blood and plasma during the very early stages of infection, when those infectious agents are present but cannot be detected by immunodiagnostic tests. Chiron expanded its cancer drug portfolio in 2002 with the acquisition of Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc and its product tezacitebine.[25] Chiron also manufactured the MMR vaccine (measles mumps and rubella) at its Liverpool plant.[26] Chiron in conjunction with Crucell (now part of Johnson & Johnson) developed a pentavalent vaccine called Quinvaxem targeting 5 diseases in children.
Lawsuits[edit]
When in 1991 Cetus was acquired it was subject to a lawsuit by the Eastman Kodak Company over the rights to the polymerase chain reaction product, which was settled in 1993.[19] In 1998, Chiron filed patent infringement suits in Europe, Japan and the US against Roche over its hepatitis C (HCV) products. Chiron was the first to clone HCV in 1987 after five years of research and had since filed over 100 HCV related patents in over 20 countries.[27] A settlement was reached where Roche Holding A.G. agreed to buy the global semi-exclusive nucleic acid test (NAT) patents for HCV and HIV from Chiron.[21] Bayer, the company which bought Chiron Diagnostics, sued Chiron Corporation in 2002 citing that it hid patent and equipment problems from them during purchase negotiations.[28] The case filed in Delaware alleged breach of warranty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract claims in connection with the acquisition.[29] In 2004, Chiron attracted adverse media coverage after the UK government suspended its license for manufacturing Fluvirin, an influenza vaccine, at its plant in Liverpool, England. This action left the United States government short of the vaccine. It later emerged that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may have been aware of the problem nine months earlier, but a miscommunication between the company and the FDA left the problem unsolved until the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency), the British equivalent of the FDA stepped in and suspended Chiron's license.[30] The company undertook a remediation program and succeeded in restoring the manufacturing license from MHRA in 2005. However, the incident resulted in a class action lawsuit for nearly $280m being brought against Chiron and its executive for allegedly, in 2003, overstating its ability to manufacture and ship the vaccine Fluvirin, thus allowing Novartis to buy Chiron shares below market value when the plant temporarily closed down. The amount settled in 2008 was for $30m.[31]
Bombings[edit]
On August 27, 2003 two bombs exploded at Chiron's headquarters in Emeryville, California.[32] A group calling itself Revolutionary Cells e-mailed a statement to reporters taking credit for the bombing and claimed that their action was due to Chiron's past contracts with Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract research firm that conducts experiments on animals. The FBI has named Daniel Andreas San Diego as the lead suspect and placed him on its FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list.[33][34]
The end of Chiron[edit]
Novartis Corporation was the result of a merger between Sandoz Laboratories and Ciba-Geigy in 1996 and owned slightly less than half of Chiron[35] as part of a Federal Trade Commission order.[36] Several of Sandoz’s subsidiaries were sold off for reasons of anti monopoly legislation.[36] In 2005, Novartis made an offer to buy Chiron. Initially this offer was rebuffed, but after the bid was substantially enhanced, Chiron was sold, and became part of Novartis in April, 2006.[37] A year later, parts of ex-Chiron were sold in part and leased in part to Bayer.[38] In 2011 Bayer announced it was withdrawing from a manufacturing plant it had leased from Novartis.[39] and Novartis finally divested most of the former Chiron assets in 2013 as part of a global reorganization.[40]

Chiron Corporation was an American multinational biotechnology firm based in Emeryville, California that was acquired by Novartis International AG on April 20, 2006. It had offices and facilities in eighteen countries on five continents. Chiron's business and research was in three main areas: biopharmaceuticals, vaccines, and blood testing. Chiron's vaccines and blood testing units were combined to form Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, while Chiron BioPharmaceuticals was integrated into Novartis Pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Novartis completed the sale of its blood transfusion diagnostics unit ("Novartis Diagnostics") to Grifols, S.A. (Barcelona, Spain) and announced agreements for the sale of its vaccines unit ("Novartis Vaccines") to GSK Vaccines[1].

Early history[edit]
Chiron (/ˈkaɪˌrɒn/ KY-rɑn after the centaur from Greek mythology)[2] was founded in 1981 by chairman, William J. Rutter, president and chief executive, Professor Edward Penhoet, and vice president for research, Pablo DT Valenzuela. All were academics from the University of California; Penhoet at Berkeley, where he continued to lecture, and the others from San Francisco.[2] Chiron formed a partnership with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Ciba-Geigy Ltd.,[2] through the Biocine Company,[3][4] to use genetic engineering to develop vaccines and to treat, prevent and diagnose diseases such as AIDS, herpes and malaria.[2][5] Other partnerships included Thicon Inc. to develop a growth factor hormone for the treatment of wounds and Merck & Co to develop an improvement to their existing hepatitis B vaccine.[2] In 1986, Professor Penhoet said: "Our business strategy is to dominate small markets rather than take a small presence in a broad market." The niche that Chiron was focusing on was ophthalmology, which Mr. Penhoet said was "big enough to be interesting, but small enough to service with 40 salespeople."[2] Professor Penhoet also stated that Chiron was set up to provide the enabling technology for others to use under license,[2] and later saying that Chiron was "as close to a virtual corporation as you can be", with few fixed assets but more relationships.[6]
Expansion[edit]
In 1988, Chiron formed a joint venture company, called Mimesys Inc., with Johnson & Johnson and the Warner-Lambert Company, to develop the next generation of biotech drugs.[7] The following year Chiron recruited Gregory Lawless, who had come from DuPont, to take over as president and CEO.[8] This led to additional buying that included the acquisition of Du Pont in partnership with Ortho Diagnostic Systems;[9] Munich based Adatomed GmbH;[10] and a merger with fellow biotech company Cetus Corporation[11] after Cetus failed to get approval for its drug Interleukin-2.[12] Hollings Renton of Cetus became president and CEO when Gregory Lawless agreed to leave.[3] Mr Renton resigned in 1992[13] and was replaced by Sean Lance, from Glaxo Wellcome in 1998,[14] and finally by Howard Pien from GlaxoSmithKline in 2003.[15] After the acquisition of Cetus, Chiron split its operations among five entities: Cetus Oncology, for cancer drugs; the Biocine Company, for vaccines; Chiron Diagnostics, for blood screening and other diagnostic tests (later sold to Bayer AG for $1.1 billion[16]); Chiron Intraoptics, for eye surgery, and Chiron Technologies, for research and development.[6]
Products and other acquisitions[edit]
In 1992, the company's first product, Proleukin, was approved in United States for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; previously it was only approved for use with kidney cancer.[17] This was followed a year later by Betaseron, a beta interferon, the first treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and made by Berlex Laboratories Inc.[18][19] In 1997 Chiron provided the active ingredient, becaplermin, in Regranex, a topical treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, manufactured by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc.[20] In 2001, Chiron acquired PathoGenesis for its antibiotic drug Tobi,[21] the first inhaled antibiotic approved for treating lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.[22] Having launched its first vaccine product, Fluad, an adjuvant influenza vaccine, in 1996, the vaccine line was expanded significantly in 1998 with the acquisition of the European vaccine businesses of Behring (Germany) and Sclavo (Italy). This was followed in 2003 by the acquisition of PowderJect, the UK-based vaccines company, making Chiron the second-largest flu vaccines provider and the fifth-largest vaccines business in the world.[23][24] In 1998, Chiron's nucleic acid testing (NAT) blood-testing business was launched in cooperation with Gen-Probe, followed a year later by the launch of the Procleix system, which detects viral RNA and DNA in donated blood and plasma during the very early stages of infection, when those infectious agents are present but cannot be detected by immunodiagnostic tests. Chiron expanded its cancer drug portfolio in 2002 with the acquisition of Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc and its product tezacitebine.[25] Chiron also manufactured the MMR vaccine (measles mumps and rubella) at its Liverpool plant.[26] Chiron in conjunction with Crucell (now part of Johnson & Johnson) developed a pentavalent vaccine called Quinvaxem targeting 5 diseases in children.
Lawsuits[edit]
When in 1991 Cetus was acquired it was subject to a lawsuit by the Eastman Kodak Company over the rights to the polymerase chain reaction product, which was settled in 1993.[19] In 1998, Chiron filed patent infringement suits in Europe, Japan and the US against Roche over its hepatitis C (HCV) products. Chiron was the first to clone HCV in 1987 after five years of research and had since filed over 100 HCV related patents in over 20 countries.[27] A settlement was reached where Roche Holding A.G. agreed to buy the global semi-exclusive nucleic acid test (NAT) patents for HCV and HIV from Chiron.[21] Bayer, the company which bought Chiron Diagnostics, sued Chiron Corporation in 2002 citing that it hid patent and equipment problems from them during purchase negotiations.[28] The case filed in Delaware alleged breach of warranty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract claims in connection with the acquisition.[29] In 2004, Chiron attracted adverse media coverage after the UK government suspended its license for manufacturing Fluvirin, an influenza vaccine, at its plant in Liverpool, England. This action left the United States government short of the vaccine. It later emerged that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may have been aware of the problem nine months earlier, but a miscommunication between the company and the FDA left the problem unsolved until the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency), the British equivalent of the FDA stepped in and suspended Chiron's license.[30] The company undertook a remediation program and succeeded in restoring the manufacturing license from MHRA in 2005. However, the incident resulted in a class action lawsuit for nearly $280m being brought against Chiron and its executive for allegedly, in 2003, overstating its ability to manufacture and ship the vaccine Fluvirin, thus allowing Novartis to buy Chiron shares below market value when the plant temporarily closed down. The amount settled in 2008 was for $30m.[31]
Bombings[edit]
On August 27, 2003 two bombs exploded at Chiron's headquarters in Emeryville, California.[32] A group calling itself Revolutionary Cells e-mailed a statement to reporters taking credit for the bombing and claimed that their action was due to Chiron's past contracts with Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract research firm that conducts experiments on animals. The FBI has named Daniel Andreas San Diego as the lead suspect and placed him on its FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list.[33][34]
The end of Chiron[edit]
Novartis Corporation was the result of a merger between Sandoz Laboratories and Ciba-Geigy in 1996 and owned slightly less than half of Chiron[35] as part of a Federal Trade Commission order.[36] Several of Sandoz’s subsidiaries were sold off for reasons of anti monopoly legislation.[36] In 2005, Novartis made an offer to buy Chiron. Initially this offer was rebuffed, but after the bid was substantially enhanced, Chiron was sold, and became part of Novartis in April, 2006.[37] A year later, parts of ex-Chiron were sold in part and leased in part to Bayer.[38] In 2011 Bayer announced it was withdrawing from a manufacturing plant it had leased from Novartis.[39] and Novartis finally divested most of the former Chiron assets in 2013 as part of a global reorganization.[40]

Telemedicine Software











An Introduction to Telemedicine Software
Many patients face obstacles that make it difficult for them to commit the necessary time and resources to seeing their provider on a regular basis. The use of telemedicine software reduces the burden on patients by eliminating time away from work, childcare concerns, and travel time and costs.

















What is Telemedicine Software?
The term “health information technology” (health IT) is a broad concept that includes an array of technologies to store, share, and analyze health information. Telemedicine is a subset of health IT that encompasses the use of technology to deliver clinical healthcare via secure video and audio connections.
Telemedicine software is the platform used by providers to connect with patients, and share video and images. It can be integrated with a provider’s electronic health record and scheduling systems.
 















Why is Telemedicine Important?
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, about 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. While this is great news for those who now have access to health care, it does put additional strain on an already taxed system. Telehealth software is one way to service more patients in less time and to reduce the overhead of patient check in and waiting areas.
In addition, the population of elderly and chronically ill patients is growing quickly. That’s why 24 states have enacted telemedicine reinbursement parity laws and several others have legislation pending.
 
 












Offer secure video visits to your patients today!

The Core Components of Telemedicine Software
While there are a number of different telemedicine software solutions on the market and the features they offer vary, the best solutions include the following key capabilities.





EHR/PM Integration
Providers want telemedicine software that adds a new way to deliver services without adding additional complexity. EHR/PM integration makes it easy to add video visits to the mix without additional friction.
 
Mobile App for Patients
The object of telemedicine software is to make it as easy as possible for patients to get the care they need from anywhere. That’s why it is important to provide both a mobile app and the ability to use a browser. Patients can connect in the way that is easiest for them, wherever they are.
 
Eligibility Verification
Providers need assurance that they will be reimbursed for each visit conducted via video. That’s why the most comprehensive telemedicine software includes a rules engine to verify payment eligibility when the appointment is scheduled.
 
HIPAA Compliant Video
Not all video connections are secure enough to provide the patient confidentiality protections required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That’s one of the many reasons that providers are choosing purpose-built telemedicine technology, rather than consumer grade video conferencing options like Facetime or Skype–these solutions are not HIPAA-compliant video conferencing solutions.
 
Custom Branding
The ability to brand your telemedicine app with the look and logo that your patients associate with your practice gives them piece of mind that they are getting the same level of care that they’ve come to expect from your team.
 
Built-in Support
No matter how easy-to-use telemedicine software can be, no doubt there will be questions from time to time. That’s why practices should choose technology that includes in-app support for real-time issue resolution.









The Benefits of Telemedicine Software for Providers
The benefits of video visits for patients are obvious, but how do they provide an advantage for providers?





Efficiency
The option to see patients via video makes practices more efficient by reducing the number of people in the waiting area and the burden on administrative staff. When well executed, video visits can make it possible for providers to see more patients in a day.
 
Better Health Outcomes
Eliminating the barrier of transportation increases likelihood that patient treatment will be successful because it is easier to follow through with telemedicine follow-up visits.





Flexibility
Because both the provider and the patient can be anywhere during a visit using telemedicine technology, providers have increased flexibility when and from where to see patients. Office hours can be expanded or made more flexible.
 
Fewer No-Shows and Last Minute Cancellations
With video visits, transportation, child-care and work related issues are less likely to keep patients from keeping the appointment.
