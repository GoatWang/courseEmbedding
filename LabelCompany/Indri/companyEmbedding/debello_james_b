Mitek’s James DeBello Appointed Chairman 







SAN DIEGO, CA, March 9, 2016 – Mitek (NASDAQ: MITK, www.miteksystems.com), a global leader in mobile capture and identity verification software solutions, today announced that its board of directors has elected its CEO James B. DeBello, 57, as Chairman of the Board. The appointment follows the retirement and resignation today of current Chairman, John M. Thornton, 83, who served Mitek for 30 years. 
“This election reflects the Board’s confidence in Jim’s leadership and his ability to successfully execute the strategic vision of the company and drive innovation,” said director Bill Aulet, chairman of the nominating and governance committee. “After careful consideration, the Board strongly believes the alignment of Jim’s duties as chairman and CEO streamlines the implementation of our high growth strategy and continues our momentum in the marketplace.”
Mr. DeBello has served as a director since November 1994 and as Mitek’s president and Chief Executive Officer since May 2003. He created and implemented the company’s successful strategy to enter the emerging mobile capture and ID verification markets which has generated significant shareholder value over the last decade. He is co-inventor of the company’s flagship Mobile Deposit™ product and is named on five of its patents. He is widely credited for creating the mobile check deposit market in the financial industry. DeBello holds a BA, magna cum laude, from Harvard University and an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business, and was a Rotary Scholar at the University of Singapore where he studied economics and Chinese. 
“I am grateful to Mr. Thornton for his three decades of extraordinary leadership and unfailing commitment to Mitek during which he helped the company become a global leader in mobile capture and identity verification software solutions,” said James B. DeBello. “I would like to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership and their confidence in my expanded role to drive our high growth strategy.”
In addition, the company also appointed Bruce Hansen as Lead Independent Director of the Board with increased responsibility.  In his new role, Hansen will serve as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors approving information sent to the Board, approving meeting agendas for the Board and approving meeting schedules. He will also have the authority to call meetings of the independent directors, and if requested by major shareholders, be available for consultation and direct communication.
Mr. Hansen has served as a director since October 2012 and prior to that was on Mitek’s advisory board for two years.  He co-founded ID Analytics Inc., a consumer risk management company, and served as its Chairman and CEO from its inception until it was acquired by LifeLock, Inc. in 2012.   He currently serves on the boards of Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ: VRSK), Performant Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: PFMT), and Zyme Solutions, Inc.  Mr. Hansen holds a BA in economics from Harvard University and an MBA from the University of Chicago.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

Mitek's James DeBello Appointed Chairman






GlobeNewswire



Mar 9, 2016 7:00 AM EST













 




























































 SAN DIEGO, March 09, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mitek (NASDAQ:MITK) ( www.miteksystems.com), a global leader in mobile capture and identity verification software solutions, today announced that its board of directors has elected its CEO James B. DeBello, 57, as Chairman of the Board. The appointment follows the retirement and resignation today of current Chairman, John M. Thornton, 83, who served Mitek for 30 years. "This election reflects the Board's confidence in Jim's leadership and his ability to successfully execute the strategic vision of the company and drive innovation," said director Bill Aulet, chairman of the nominating and governance committee. "After careful consideration, the Board strongly believes the alignment of Jim's duties as chairman and CEO streamlines the implementation of our high growth strategy and continues our momentum in the marketplace." Mr. DeBello has served as a director since November 1994 and as Mitek's president and Chief Executive Officer since May 2003. He created and implemented the company's successful strategy to enter the emerging mobile capture and ID verification markets which has generated significant shareholder value over the last decade. He is co-inventor of the company's flagship Mobile Deposit™ product and is named on five of its patents. He is widely credited for creating the mobile check deposit market in the financial industry. DeBello holds a BA, magna cum laude, from Harvard University and an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business, and was a Rotary Scholar at the University of Singapore where he studied economics and Chinese.  "I am grateful to Mr. Thornton for his three decades of extraordinary leadership and unfailing commitment to Mitek during which he helped the company become a global leader in mobile capture and identity verification software solutions," said James B. DeBello. "I would like to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership and their confidence in my expanded role to drive our high growth strategy."

"Truthfinder is a very accurate updated system. Their information is proper. And can be very helpful too." -Juan M.









Notice
This site contains REAL police records (court records of driving citations, speeding tickets, felonies, misdemeanors, sexual offenses, mugshots, etc.), background reports, photos, court documents, address information, phone numbers, and much more. Please BE CAREFUL when conducting a search and ensure all the information you enter is accurate.
Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
