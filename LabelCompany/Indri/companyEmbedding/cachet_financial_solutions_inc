1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in "RISK FACTORS" elsewhere in this report. For further information, see "Forward-Looking Statements" below.  OVERVIEW  Reverse Merger Transaction  Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated January 14, 2014, as amended on February 11, 2014 (referred to simply as the "Merger Agreement"), we acquired by merger the business of Cachet Financial Solutions Inc., a Minnesota corporation, described in this report. The merger was completed and effective as of the close of business on February 12, 2014, upon the filing of Articles of Merger with the Minnesota Secretary of State (the "Effective Time").  At the Effective Time and pursuant to the Merger Agreement:  ? each share of common stock of Cachet Financial Solutions (Minnesota) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive 10.9532 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company's common stock, with fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole number (the "Exchange Ratio"); and  ? all securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock of Cachet Financial Solutions (Minnesota) (including shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of issued and outstanding options and warrants) that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were converted into securities convertible into or exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the Company as the holders thereof would have been entitled to receive if such securities of Cachet Financial Solutions (Minnesota) had been converted into or exercised for shares of common stock of Cachet Financial Solutions (Minnesota) immediately prior to the Effective Time, based on the Exchange Ratio. As part of this conversion, the price at which the holders securities convertible into and exercisable for common stock of the Company will be required to pay in connection with their later conversion or exercise is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per-share price at which their related options and warrants for the purchase of common stock of Cachet Financial Solutions (Minnesota) were exercisable prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.  In connection with the merger, we changed our corporate name to "Cachet Financial Solutions, Inc." to reflect our ownership of the business of Cachet Financial Solutions (Minnesota). Prior to the merger, our corporate name was "DE Acquisition 2, Inc."  The merger represented a change in control of the Company inasmuch as greater than 50% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of Company, on a post-merger basis, came to be held by the former holders of securities of Cachet Financial Solutions. As a result of the merger, the Company now owns Cachet Financial Solutions and its entire business.  The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated and effected thereby is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the contents of the actual Merger Agreement.  Unless noted otherwise, all share figures and share prices contained in this report are presented after giving effect to the capital stock transactions effected as part of the merger. In addition, all share figures and share prices contained in this report are presented after giving effect to the stock combination (reverse stock split) effected as of March 20, 2014.  Business and Development of Business  We are a technology solutions and services provider to the financial services industry. Our solutions and services enable our clients-banks, credit unions and alternative financial services providers (AFS)-to offer their customers remote deposit capture (RDC) and prepaid mobile money technologies and related services. Our clients typically seek these technologies in order to increase customer satisfaction and improve customer retention, attract new customers, develop market leadership, grow deposits in a low-cost manner, reduce their transaction costs and reduce traffic at bricks-and-mortar branches.  As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into more than 500 contracts with customers for our cloud-based SaaS products and services, and as of December 31, 2014 we had entered into 348 such contracts. Approximately 397 of those agreements were "active" as of December 31, 2015 meaning that the customer has implemented the RDC or prepaid mobile money technology enabling the processing of customer transactions. Based on current industry trends which indicate rapid adoption of RDC and prepaid mobile money technologies and growing demand by consumers, we believe we will continue to be successful in signing up additional customers at a similar rate in the future. As more and more of our customers "go-live" and consumer adoption of our cloud-based SaaS RDC technology increases, we believe we will experience an overall increase to our revenues as a portion of our revenue is generated on a per transaction fee basis. While we expect our revenues to continue to increase, revenues from transaction volume has not yet grown to the level needed to support our current cost structure. As a result, we have incurred operating losses since inception. Our continued operation critically depends on obtaining suitable financing.  Our sources of revenue include:  ? up-front payments associated with our initial implementation of RDC Select (or other product offerings) for our customers, which may include payments for the sale of scanning and related equipment and payments for additional marketing support from our Company;  ? professional services, including implementation services, development of interfaces requested by customers, assistance with integration of the Company's services with the customers' applications, dedicated support, and advisory services to customers who choose to develop their own interfaces and applications; and  ? recurring revenue associated with the following:  ? deposit fees, monthly active-user fees, and bill-pay fees; and  ? transaction-processing fees and fees for the ongoing support and maintenance of our software.  Recurring revenue is expected to include fixed monthly service charges to customers for our service, transactional fees for the number items processed, or a combination of both. We believe that this model of recurring revenue will have a positive impact on our cash flow and valuation. Reliance on recurring revenues will mean, however, that transactional volume will likely be a key metric for our ability to scale and generate sufficient revenues to ultimately become profitable.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Cachet Financial Solutions Inc. The wholly owned subsidiary is the only entity with operational activity and therefore no intercompany transactions exist with the parent entity which would need to be eliminated. The Company has prepared the consolidated financial statements included herein, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern. From inception to December 31, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $69.3 million, and current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately $6.8 million. In 2016, the Company expects to continue to grow its client base and increase revenues through higher RDC transaction volumes and monthly active user fees ("MAUs") from its Select Mobile Money offering. Nevertheless, the Company expects to continue to incur operating losses through December 31, 2016.  In 2015, the Company raised approximately $8.0 million in gross proceeds from various PIPE transactions, and the exercising of warrants and borrowed approximately $1.2 million, net principal from its directors. Since December 2015, the Company has extended debt and accrued interest payments of approximately $1.8 million due in January 2016 to January of 2017. In addition, the Company has raised approximately $1,361,000 in gross proceeds from a March 2016 equity offering, approximately $807,000 from warrant exercises and $225,000 from note agreements with two directors. See Note 16. Subsequent Events for details on the March 2016 equity offering.  In October 2015, the Company entered into a $10 million equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (the "Purchase Agreement"). Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, up to $10.0 million in shares, as described below, of the Company's common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing November 6, 2015, the date that the registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The purchase price of shares of common stock related to the future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales. The Company may direct Lincoln Park, at its sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock on any business day (a "Regular Purchase"), provided that at least one business day has passed since the most recent Regular Purchase, increasing to up to 200,000 shares, depending upon the closing sale price of the common stock. However, in no event shall a Regular Purchase be more than $500,000. The Company may also direct Lincoln Park at its sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to $100,000 worth of shares of common stock on any business day (an "Additional Purchase"), provided that at least six business days have passed since the most recent Additional Purchase was completed. In addition, the Company may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases if the request is submitted on a Regular Purchase date and on that date the closing sale price of the common stock is not below $1.00. The Company may not sell shares of common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement at any time to the extent that the number of shares to be sold would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates exceeding 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of the common stock.  The Company is actively seeking additional sources of financing and has engaged in discussions with investment banking firms to assist in raising additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity, as well as the Company's continued efforts to raise capital through the exercise of its existing warrants and, if need be, will utilize the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC to fund working capital. Additionally, the Company is negotiating to extend the maturity date on some of its outstanding debt. Historically, the Company has demonstrated an ability to raise funds to support the business operations.  The Company believes based on its current cashflow forecast and estimated availability, subject to the terms as disclosed on the Purchase Agreement, it has enough cash to continue operations until December 12, 2016, when certain debts mature.  Revenue Recognition  The Company generates revenue from the following sources: (1) subscription and support fees (2) transaction volume fees, (3) active monthly user fees for mobile wallet offering (4) fees related to the implementation of RDC and mobile wallet software for clients, and (5) professional services such as client specific software customization and other products and services.  The Company's arrangements do not contain general rights of return. The Company's subscription arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the SaaS technology platform and, as a result, are accounted for as service arrangements. The Company records revenue net of any sales or excise taxes.  The Company commences revenue recognition for its SaaS technology platform and professional services when all of the following criteria are met:  ? there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  ? the service has been or is being provided to the customer;  ? collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and  ? the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.  Subscription and Support Revenue  Subscription and support revenue is primarily derived from customers accessing the SaaS technology platform and includes subscription, support, transaction volume fees and active user fees for mobile wallet offering. Subscription and support revenue is recognized ratably over the contracted term of each respective subscription agreement, commencing on the date the service is provisioned to the customer, provided the four revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Transaction volume fees are recognized as transactions are processed and monthly services performed and active user fees for mobile wallet offering revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as earned provided the four revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Professional Services and Other Revenue  Professional services include implementation services, development of interfaces requested by customers, assistance with integration of the Company's services with the customers' applications, dedicated support, and advisory services to customers who choose to develop their own interfaces and applications. Professional services are typically performed within three to six months of entering into an arrangement with the customer. Professional services are typically sold on a fixed-fee basis, but are offered on a time-and-material basis as well. Revenue for time-and-material arrangements is recognized as the services are performed. Revenue for professional services is recognized under a percent of completion method matching the revenue with the costs of the computer programmer's time. The Company uses internal milestones to estimate the costs and related percent of completion. Professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of the SaaS offering.  Implementation Fees  The implementation fees are recognized over the term of the contract or expected life of the contract where no contractual term exists. Generally, client agreements are entered into for 12 to 36 months. A majority of the implementation service component of the arrangement with customers is performed within 120 days of entering into a contract with the customer.  Multiple Element Arrangements  The Company enters into multiple element arrangements in which a customer may purchase a subscription and professional services. For arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company evaluates whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting.  Subscription and support contracts have standalone value as the Company sells subscriptions and support separately. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support services, the Company considers the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of its professional services and whether the Company sells its applications to new customers without professional services. Based on these considerations the Company assessed that its professional services have standalone value.  The Company determines the selling price for each element based on the selling price hierarchy of: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence ("TPE"), and (iii) estimated selling price ("ESP"). The Company is unable to establish VSOE for any of its services, as the Company has not historically priced its services with sufficient consistency. The Company is also unable to establish TPE, as the Company does not have sufficient information regarding pricing of third-party subscription and professional services similar to its offerings. As a result, the Company has developed estimates of selling prices based on margins established by senior management as the targets in the Company's selling and pricing strategies after considering the nature of the services, the economic and competitive environment, and the nature and magnitude of the costs incurred. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenue, if any.  Deferred Revenue  Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Company's subscription and support offerings as described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. For subscription agreements, the Company typically invoices its customers in monthly or annual fixed installments. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of these multi-year subscription agreements. Deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees, which are recognized in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy. The portion of deferred revenue the Company expects to recognize during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company's cloud-based application, providing customer support, data communications expense, salaries and benefits of operations and support personnel, software development fees, software license fees, amortization expense associated with acquired developed technology assets, and property and equipment depreciation.  Accounts Receivable  Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer's financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $10,000 and $25,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company's customer base, thus spreading the credit risk.  Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the appraised value of the portion of identifiable assets that were acquired from the DeviceFidelity Inc. acquisition completed in March 2014. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or between annual dates if circumstances change that would more likely than not cause impairment. Management performs its annual impairment test at the close of each fiscal year, and considers several factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment, including the Company's current financial position and results, general economic and industry conditions and legal and regulatory conditions. No impairment of goodwill was identified for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 11 for further discussion.  Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Including License Agreements  The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In December 2015, the Company determined that an impairment of $216,369 had occurred on its finite-lived intangible assets related to certain customer contracts acquired in the acquisition of the Select Mobile Money business on March 4, 2014. In determining the impairment loss, the Company reviewed all circumstances, including the undiscounted cash flows it expects to derive from those contracts going forward.  Deferred Financing Costs  Deferred financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related debt agreements. The costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. In the event debt is converted or paid prior to maturity, any unamortized issuance costs are charged to expense.  Deferred Commissions  The Company capitalizes commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer contracts. Commission costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer contract.  Net Loss Per Common Share  Basic and diluted net loss per common share for all periods presented is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding and common stock equivalents, when dilutive. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents include common shares issuable pursuant to stock warrants, stock options, convertible preferred stock and convertible note agreements. Common stock equivalents were not included in determining the fully diluted loss per share as they were anti-dilutive.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Warrants issued with price protection features are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. With respect to determination of fair values of financial instruments there are the following three levels of inputs:  ? Level 1 Inputs-Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  ? Level 2 Inputs-Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  ? Level 3 Inputs-Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.  The warrants that are carried at fair value are valued using level 3 inputs utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model under probability weighted estimated outcomes.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect certain reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used to value stock options and warrants, conversion incentive and share purchase price adjustment, and the value of shares of common stock issued for services.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the estimated fair values of warrants and stock options. For purposes of determining the estimated fair values the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For the periods prior to the Company's common stock being traded, the Company estimated the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the volatility of comparable peer companies which are publicly traded; for later periods, the Company includes its actual common stock trading to compute volatility. The Company determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and post-vesting forfeitures. The Company uses the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line amortization method over the vesting period. The fair values of stock award grants are determined based on the number of shares granted and estimated fair value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Research and Development Costs  The Company considers those costs incurred in developing new processes and solutions to be research and development costs and they are expensed as incurred.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014  Revenues  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 62% or $1,652,896 to $4,301,004, when compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an overall increase in RDC transactions processed which totaled 5,353,844 for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of 53% or 1,843,297 from the prior year. The increase was attributable to an overall increase in the number of banks and credit unions which were "active" customers, meaning that they have implemented the products and service enabling the processing of customer transactions. As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into 500 contracts signed for a total of 557 total products, of which 397 of those products were active, meaning that they have implemented the products and services enabling the processing of customer transactions. This compares to a total of 348 signed contracts, of which 252 were active as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we generated approximately $670,000 of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 for professional services as compared to approximately $412,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated from transactional volume fees, monthly active user fees and other recurring support services. Approximately 16% represents revenue from professional services primarily related to integration development work performed as part of implementing our mobile money product offering, while the remaining 14% was from implementation fees that are recognized over the lives of our contracts with financial institutions. The growth in 2015 is equally spread across the product offering of implementation, recurring support services and professional services as the percent of total sales remained relatively consistent between years. As more clients have implemented our SaaS cloud based technologies they are starting to process more significant transactional and monthly active user fees and therefore, we anticipate the mix of revenues will shift towards a higher percentage that are recurring in nature versus one-time implementation fees.  Since the March 2014 acquisition of Select Mobile Money from DeviceFidelity, we entered into several significant contracts, including Navy Federal Credit Union ("NFCU"), which is the world's largest credit union.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved. They provide guaranteed¹ income for you and your loved ones regardless of market performance. And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.
