Institutional Equities

Our role is to demystify the challenges of navigating and executing orders within highly-fragmented markets. Locating and aggregating actionable liquidity in today's highly-fragmented trading market ecosystem can prove elusive for even the most skilled buy-side traders and PMs. Lampert Capital Markets is unique in that our global, agency-only order execution platform enables institutional clients to efficiently locate liquidity and execute block trades in single stocks, ETFs, ADRs, and leverages our firm's direct market access to all relevant U.S. equities platforms and upwards of 100 international market centers.
We work for our clients, not against them. Unlike traditional "major firm" order execution platforms that internalize and often trade against client orders, Lampert serves a fiduciary; we are devoid of any competing interests or conflicts. This enables us to deliver true best execution.
