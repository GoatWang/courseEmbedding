 Educational Background



B.S. in Electrical Engineering 


University of California - Berkeley

                  University of California Berkeley

National rankings: In a National Research Council analysis of 212 doctoral programs at American universities, 48 Berkeley programs place among the top 10 nationwide.

Faculty awards and honors: There are 8 Nobel Laureates, 32 MacArthur Fellows, and 4 Pulitzer Prize winners among the current faculty.

History of UC Berkeley: Historical highlights, arranged by topic, following the campus's development — from UC's founding in 1868 to a turn-of-the-century building boom, a research explosion in the 1930s, the Free Speech Movement of the '60s, and Berkeley's key role today in science and technology revolutions.

Timeline of discoveries and contributions by UC Berkeley scholars.

Traditions of Cal: Who was the Angel of Death? What's with the "Big C" up there in the hills — and why is it sometimes green? Who wears Oski's jolly bear head and size 54 yellow sweater?

Tours and webcams: Check out what's happening on Sproul Plaza, the campus's true heart. See stunning live views of the Bay Area from the Lawrence Hall of Science's perch in the Berkeley hills.

Chancellor and administration: Information on Chancellor Robert Birgeneau, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost George W. Breslauer, and how the university is organized. Organizational charts are included.

UC System overview and links: On the campuses, laboratories, and medical centers that comprise UC's public educational system, as well as UC's K-12 partnerships, economic impact, and agriculture and environmental resources.

Member, Board of Directors

                    1996 - Current                  


Extreme Networks, Inc.

                    Extreme Networks is committed to delivering
a seamless end-user friendly experience.


Since our founding 15 years and 30 million ports ago, Extreme Networks has always been at the forefront of innovative networking. That tradition continues today with our vision, technology, ability, and focused dedication to deliver an inclusive solution that spans the converged edge to the enterprise core and beyond.

We accomplish this through best-in-class Ethernet technologies; powerful end-point awareness that optimizes the Quality of User Experience by recognizing users, their devices and virtual machines; and ExtremeXOS®, an end-to-end modular, extensible, and always-on operating system that adds intelligence to the network. Further, the power of ExtremeXOS guarantees predictability from the edge to the cloud. Whether the network is a cost of doing business or an ongoing expense, our platforms offer network planners the tools to build a more flexible and cost-effective infrastructure.

This Quality of User Experience is coupled with unequaled price/ performance, sustainability, multi-vendor interoperability, and customer intimacy. In the same way that every network is unique to us, every customer is also unique. Our corporate focus is reflected in this approach to the market.

The value of the new mobility is intrinsic. For end users, it means a consistent, intuitive experience and the productivity, efficiency and satisfaction that come along with it. For CIOs, it means a platform to optimize, even personalize, each network connection from access edge to virtual server, and through that personalization offer the predictability of a Quality User Experience. For the COO or Operations team at a hosting provider, it creates a platform to offer more competitive, feature-rich and valuable services. And for mobile operators, it establishes an environment through which to offer differentiated and personalized services
