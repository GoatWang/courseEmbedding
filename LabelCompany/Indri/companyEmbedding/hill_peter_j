Hill, Peter J Sr
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Hill, Peter J Sr carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Hill, Peter J Sr currently holds license 0401014143 (Architect License), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Hill, Peter J Sr



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Hill, Peter J Sr



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.
