 ARCBEST CORPORATION
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
(Non-Employee Directors – with deferral feature)
 

Participant:XXXXXXXXXX
Grant Date:XXXXX XX,
XXXX
Award
Number:XXXX.XXX
Restricted Stock
Units Awarded:X,XXX
 

This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this “
Agreement ”) is dated as of this XXXX
day of XXXXX XX, XXXX (the “ Grant Date
”), and is between ArcBest Corporation (the “
Company ”) and XXXXXXXXXXX (“
Participant ”).

WHEREAS, the Company, by action of the Board and approval of its
shareholders established the ArcBest Corporation 2005 Ownership
Incentive Plan (the “ Plan ”);

WHEREAS, Participant is a member of the Board and is not employed
by the Company or a Subsidiary;

WHEREAS, the Company desires to encourage Participant to own Common
Stock for the purposes stated in Section 1 of the Plan; and

WHEREAS, Participant and the Company have entered into this
Agreement to govern the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit Award
(as defined below) granted to Participant by the Company. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree as follows:





1.
Definitions





Defined terms in the Plan shall have the same meaning in this
Agreement, except where the context otherwise requires. 





2.
Grant of Restricted Stock
Units





On the Grant Date, the Company hereby grants to Participant an
Award of x,xxx Restricted Stock Units (the “
Award ”) in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan
(as amended from time to time).  Each Restricted Stock
Unit subject to the Award represents the right to receive one Share
(as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Paragraph 13 hereof
and/or Section 13 of the Plan) upon the terms and subject to the
conditions (including the vesting conditions) set forth in this
Agreement and the Plan.  By accepting the Award,
Participant irrevocably agrees on behalf of Participant and
Participant’s successors and permitted assigns to all of the
terms and conditions of the Award as set forth in or pursuant to
this Agreement and the Plan (as such Plan may be amended from time
to time).



 





 







3.
Vesting; Payment









(a)
The Award shall not be vested as of the
Grant Date and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise
vested pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  After
the Grant Date, provided that Participant remains a member of the
Board continuously through the first anniversary of the Grant Date
(the “ Normal Vesting Date ”), the Award shall
become vested with respect to 100% of the Restricted Stock Units on
such Normal Vesting Date.  In addition, prior to the
Normal Vesting Date:



 

(i)  the Award shall become vested with respect to 100%
of the Restricted Stock Units on the first date on or after the
Grant Date that the Participant satisfies the requirements for
Normal Retirement, as defined below, whether or not actual
retirement or separation from service has occurred on that
date.
 
(ii)
on the first date on or after the Grant Date on which Participant
satisfies the requirements for Early Retirement, as defined below,
whether or not actual retirement or separation from service has
occurred on that date, the Award shall become vested with respect
to the number of the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award
multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is equal to
the number of full months between such date and the Grant Date, and
(B) the denominator of which is 12, and the Award shall continue to
vest on the fifteenth day of each subsequent month with respect to
an additional one-twelfth of the number of Restricted Stock Units
subject to the Award until the first day of the month in which the
Normal Vesting Date occurs.   In the month that the
Normal Vesting Date occurs, all Units not previously vested shall
become vested on the date of the month that corresponds to the
Grant Date.

 
For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Normal Retirement" shall mean
Participant's retirement from service as a member of the Board on
or after age 65 so long as Participant has, as of the date of such
retirement, at least 5 years of service with the Company. 
 
For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Early Retirement" shall mean
Participant's retirement from service as a member of the Board with
at least 3 years of Board member service with the Company.
 

Restricted Stock Units that have vested and are no longer subject
to a substantial risk of forfeiture are referred to herein as
"Vested Units."  Restricted Stock Units that are not
vested and generally remain subject to forfeiture are referred to
herein as "Unvested Units."






(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Paragraph 3, the Award shall be subject to earlier acceleration of
vesting and/or forfeiture and transfer as provided in this
Agreement and the Plan.









(c)
Subject to Paragraph 3(d) below, on the
Normal Vesting Date, or, if earlier, the date Participant’s
service as a member of the Board terminates on or after he
satisfied the requirements for accelerated vesting by virtue of
qualifying for Normal Retirement or Early Retirement, Participant
shall be entitled to receive one Share (subject to adjustment under
Paragraph 13 hereof and/or Section 13 of the Plan) for each Vested
Unit in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the Plan.  The Company will transfer such Shares
to







 






Participant or Participant’s
designee subject to (i) Participant’s satisfaction of
any required tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph
6 and (ii) the restrictions, if any, imposed by the Company
under Paragraph 14(f) or otherwise pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. 









(d)
Subject to the satisfaction of all of the
tax withholding obligations described in Section 7 below,
Participant may irrevocably elect to defer the receipt of any
Shares issuable pursuant to Vested Units, other than Units
distributable by reason of Sections 6(b) or (c), by submitting to
the Company an election to defer receipt in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the “ Deferral Election Form
”).  In the event Participant intends to defer the
receipt of any Shares, Participant must submit a proposed Deferral
Election Form to the Company by December 31 of the year preceding
the year of the Grant Date of the Award.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any Shares subject to Vested Units with respect to which
a deferred payment date has been elected shall be immediately
distributed to Participant or Participant’s estate, as
applicable, upon Participant’s death or Disability (as
defined below) or upon a “change in the ownership or
effective control” of the Company or in the “ownership
of a substantial portion of the assets” of the Company within
the meanings ascribed to such terms in Treasury Department
regulations or other guidance issued under Section 409A of the
Code.  Participant hereby represents that he or she
understands the effect of any such deferral of the receipt of
shares under relevant federal, state and local tax laws.




 





(e)
The date upon which Shares are to be
issued under either Paragraph 3(c) or 3(d) is referred to as the
“ Settlement Date .”  The issuance of
the Shares hereunder may be effected by the issuance of a stock
certificate, recording shares on the stock records of the Company
or by crediting shares in an account established on the
Participant’s behalf with a brokerage firm or other
custodian, in each case as determined by the
Company.  Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant
to the Award.





Notwithstanding the above, prior to a Change in Control,
(i) for administrative or other reasons, the Company may from
time to time temporarily suspend the issuance of Shares in respect
of earned Vested Units (whether or not deferred), (ii) the
Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares during any
period when the Company determines that the delivery of Shares
hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable
laws, and (iii) the date on which shares are issued hereunder
may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it
determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other
administrative matters.  Any delay pursuant to 3(e)(ii)
shall only be until such time that the Company determines that the
delivery of shares would no longer violate any Federal, state or
other applicable law.  Notwithstanding the delay for
administrative or other reasons provided for in clauses (i) and
(iii) above, in no event will such issuance of shares be delayed
beyond the later of the end of the calendar year in which the
Settlement Date occurs, or the 15 th day of the third month after the end of
such year, or such other time as permitted under Section 409A of
the Code and the regulations thereunder without the imposition of
any additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, this Agreement or
the Deferral Election Form to the contrary, the Plan, this
Agreement and the Deferral Election Form shall be construed or
deemed to be amended as necessary to comply with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code to avoid the imposition of any
additional or accelerated taxes or other penalties under



3





 



Section 409A of the Code.  The Committee, in its sole
discretion, shall determine the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code applicable to the Plan, this Agreement and the Deferral
Election Form and shall interpret the terms of the Plan, this
Agreement and the Deferral Election Form consistently therewith.
Under no circumstances, however, shall the Company have any
liability under the Plan, this Agreement or the Deferral Election
Form for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or
payable pursuant to the Plan, this Agreement or the Deferral
Election Form, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed
under Section 409A of the Code.





4.
Status of Participant





Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder (including,
without limitation, any voting rights with respect to the Shares
subject to the Award and, except to the extent the Award is
adjusted pursuant to Paragraph 13 hereof and/or Section 14 of the
Plan, the right to receive any payments with respect to dividends
or other distributions paid with respect to the Shares subject to
this Award) with respect to either the Restricted Stock Units
granted hereunder or the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock
Units, unless and until such Shares are issued in respect of Vested
Units, and then only to the extent of such issued Shares.





5.
Effect of Termination of Board
Service; Change in Control









(a)
General .  Except as provided in Paragraphs 5(b) or
(c), upon a termination of Participant’s service as a member
of the Board for any reason, the Unvested Units shall be forfeited
by Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without
payment of any consideration to Participant.




 





(b)
Death; Disability
.  Upon a termination of
Participant’s service as a member of the Board by reason of
Participant’s death or Disability, all Unvested Units shall
vest as of the date of such termination of service and be issued as
soon as administratively possible.  For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term “ Disability ” shall
mean a condition under which Participant either (i) is unable
to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any
medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be
expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a
continuous period of not less than twelve months, or (ii) is,
by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental
impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be
expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve
months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not
less than three months under an accident and health
plan.









(c)
Change in Control
.  All Unvested Units shall
vest as of the date a Change in Control occurs and be issued as
soon as administratively possible so long as with respect to any
amounts that the Company determines to be deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such Change in
Control qualifies as a “change in the ownership or effective
control” of the Company or in the “ownership of a
substantial portion of the assets” of the Company within the
meanings ascribed to such terms in Treasury Department regulations
or other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code.







 







6.
Withholding and Disposition of
Shares





Participant is liable and responsible for all taxes owed in
connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company
takes with respect to any tax reporting or withholding obligations
that arise in connection with the Award. The Company does not make
any representation or undertaking regarding the tax treatment of
the grant or vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of Shares
issuable pursuant to the Award. The Company does not commit and is
under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate
Participant’s tax liability.





7.
Excess Parachute
Payments





Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
of the payments in respect of this Award, together with any other
payments to which Participant has the right to receive from the
Company or any purchaser, successor, or assign, would constitute an
“excess parachute payment” (as defined in Code Section
280G), the payments pursuant to the Award and/or such other plans
or agreements shall be reduced to the largest amount as will result
in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax
imposed by Code Section 4999.





8.
Plan Controls





The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan,
as it exists on the Grant Date and as the Plan is amended from time
to time.  In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the
terms of the Plan shall control, except as expressly stated
otherwise in this Agreement.  The term
“Section” generally refers to provisions within the
Plan; provided, however, the term “Paragraph” shall
refer to a provision of this Agreement. 





9.
Limitation on Rights; No Right to
Future Grants; Extraordinary Item 





By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award,
Participant acknowledges that: (a) Participant’s
participation in the Plan is voluntary and (b) the grant of
the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment or Board
member relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company
shall be under no obligation whatsoever to advise Participant of
the existence, maturity or termination of any of
Participant’s rights hereunder and Participant shall be
responsible for familiarizing himself or herself with all matters
contained herein and in the Plan which may affect any of
Participant’s rights or privileges hereunder.





10.
Committee Authority





Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement or the
Plan, any adjustments required to be made under the Plan, and any
controversy that may arise under the Plan or this Agreement shall
be determined by the Committee in its sole and absolute
discretion.  Such decision by the Committee shall be
final and binding.

                    National Briefing | Washington: A Vote To Strike                
The Teamsters union said workers voted overwhelmingly to strike against the Roadway Corporation, the Yellow Corporation, the Arkansas Best Corporation and a unit of the USFreightways Corporation if the sides fail to reach agreement on a contract by March 31.

                    Arkansas Best's Initial Offering                
The Arkansas Best Corporation, a freight transportation concern based in Fort Smith, Ark., made an initial public offering of 15.7 million common shares yesterday through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation. The shares were priced at $14 a share, with 10.7 million shares being sold by Arkansas Best and the remaining shares being sold by Kelso Best Partners L.P., which currently owns about 80 percent of the company. Kelso Best Partners has granted the underwriting syndicate an option to buy up to an additional 2,355,000 shares of the company's common stock it owns to cover overallotments. After the offering, about 21.7 percent, or about 11.6 percent if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, will be owned by Kelso Best Partners and approximately 11.5 percent will be owned by management. The company's common stock will be traded on the Nasdaq National Market System under the symbol ABFS.

LEAD: Debt











                    Company News; Arkansas Best Bidding Disputed                
LEAD: The Razorback Acquisition Corporation, bested last week by Kelso & Company in bidding for the Arkansas Best Corporation, said that the competition had been unfair. In a letter to Arkansas Best, a trucking company based in Fort Smith, Ark., Razorback said it was informed by Arkansas Best late last Wednesday that the bid deadline was 6 P.M.











                    COMPANY NEWS: BRIEFS                
LEAD: Arkansas Best Corp., Fort Smith, Ark., a freight transportation company, rejected Razorback Acquisition Corp.'s revised tender offer of $23 a share.










BUSINESS PEOPLE

                    Arkansas Best Suitor Gets Takeover Lesson                
LEAD: Emanuel R. Pearlman, the would-be acquirer of the Arkansas Best Corporation, had been in the takeover business all of 48 hours when he got a strong dose of what lies ahead. The target company ignored his phone calls. The newspapers gave his $230 million deal short shrift. And he balks at the suggestion that he is a corporate raider.











                    Bid Made for Arkansas Best                
LEAD: At a time when many classmates are still paying off the burdensome loans they took out for business school, Emanuel R. Pearlman announced yesterday that he would attempt his first hostile takeover.
