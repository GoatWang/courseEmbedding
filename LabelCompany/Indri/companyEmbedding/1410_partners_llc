1410 Partners, LLC, Joins Hunt Mortgage Group

May 11, 2016 | Member News 


On May 6, the staff of 1410 Partners, LLC, joined Hunt Mortgage Group, opening a new west coast office.
John McAlister, Founder and Principal of 1410 Partners, is now a Managing Director with Hunt Mortgage Group and leader of the newly formed west coast office. Sean Spear is also a Managing Director and will continue working with his current clients on their projects. They plan to expand their team over the next several months, including a senior investment banker, financial analyst, and additional support staff.
In an e-mail, McAlister explained, “Assignments on which 1410 Partners is currently engaged will remain unchanged in terms of staffing or our focus. Rather, our new affiliation with Hunt Mortgage Group will allow us to expand our capabilities by having direct access to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA lending programs as well as balance sheet loan capabilities.”
