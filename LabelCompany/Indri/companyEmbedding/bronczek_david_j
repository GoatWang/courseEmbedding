FedEx names Bronczek as president and COO
Move comes 11 months early as TNT integration goes faster than expected.
By DC Velocity Staff



 Comment





 Enlarge
FedEx's executive management structure as of Feb. 1, 2017.
Transport and logistics giant FedEx Corp. has named David J. Bronczek as its president and chief operating officer effective Feb. 1, making the change 11 months earlier than originally planned. Frederick W. Smith remains as the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
Memphis-based FedEx had first announced its plans for the leadership change in September, saying Bronczek would take over the position on Jan. 1, 2018, but accelerated its plans because the integration of TNT into FedEx Express went faster than expected, the company said. FedEx paid $4.8 billion in May 2016 to acquire Dutch delivery firm TNT Express N.V., combining TNT's strong European road haulage network with FedEx's worldwide air infrastructure.
The new year also saw the retirement of T. Michael Glenn, who had served for nearly 20 years as executive vice president for market development and corporate communications. He stepped down on Dec. 31.
Bronczek will assume a new title in the company, with responsibility for marketing, sales, and all FedEx operating companies. He had previously served as CEO of FedEx Express, the company's air and international unit.
Replacing Bronczek as president and CEO of FedEx Express will be David L. Cunningham, who had previously served as regional president of the Asia Pacific Region and most recently as executive vice president and chief operating officer.  In his new position, Cunningham will be responsible for the leadership and direction of the FedEx Express group, which includes FedEx Express and TNT.
"While this was announced last September, substantial progress in integrating the TNT acquisition into FedEx Express now allows us to accelerate Dave [Bronczek's] promotion by 11 months in advance of fiscal year 2018," Smith said in a release. "He is uniquely qualified to take on the position of president and chief operating officer. Under Dave's leadership for the past 17 years, the FedEx Express team has achieved outstanding financial results and service levels."

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
