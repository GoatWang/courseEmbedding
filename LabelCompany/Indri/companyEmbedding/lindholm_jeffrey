Brocade Names Jeff Lindholm as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales 

















Networking Industry Expert Tapped to Drive Growth in Key Customer Segments and Geographies


SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwire - Feb 25, 2013) -  Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD) today announced the appointment of Jeff Lindholm to the position of senior vice president of Worldwide Sales to be effective on March 4. In this role, Mr. Lindholm is responsible for leading the development and execution of the company's overall global sales strategy spanning across all Brocade networking products and solutions. Mr. Lindholm will report directly to Brocade CEO, Lloyd Carney.
Mr. Lindholm is chartered with implementing strategies to expand the company's customer base and to take advantage of new business opportunities that are arising in the networking industry due to key industry trends such as data center virtualization, cloud computing and software-defined networking. His primary objective will be to grow sales revenue within the IP/Ethernet networking market and to maintain leadership in the storage networking market, through OEM and channel partners as well as system integrators and direct sales. 
"After careful evaluation of Brocade's current opportunities in the marketplace and consideration for the future direction of the company, I am confident that Jeff has the right mix of industry knowledge, business acumen and leadership skills to drive continued growth in key customer segments and geographies," said Lloyd Carney, CEO of Brocade. "His extensive background in networking sales and experience with implementing a customer-focused sales approach will undoubtedly solidify Brocade's position as the industry's leading pure-play networking vendor."
With more than 30 years of experience in the high-tech industry, Mr. Lindholm has held a number of sales and marketing leadership positions at networking and telecommunications technology companies. At Juniper Networks, he served in key executive roles including the senior vice president of Worldwide Sales as well as the chief marketing officer. Mr. Lindholm was also senior vice president of Sales and Marketing at Bigband Networks, where he oversaw the direct sales organization and led market development of next-generation video technologies.
Most recently, Mr. Lindholm served as the senior vice president of Field Operations at Arbor Networks, a provider of network security and management solutions for enterprise and service provider networks. There, he was instrumental in leading the expansion of Arbor Networks' footprint and revenues within its core markets. 
"With the ongoing proliferation of cloud computing and the continued acceptance of nascent technologies like fabric-based network architectures and software-defined networking, Brocade is well-positioned to lead in the exciting transformation taking place in the networking industry today," said Jeff Lindholm. "This will require discipline, operational excellence and high levels of collaboration among teams. I am committed to leading a talented sales organization and ensuring that we have the right sales strategy in place that will enable us to quickly respond to customer needs and fully capitalize on these opportunities as they present themselves."
