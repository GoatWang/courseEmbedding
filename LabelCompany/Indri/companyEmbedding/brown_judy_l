Years licensed: Least to mostClear all View mapLitigationIf you have issues with someone and want to sue, you will need a litigation lawyer. Litigation lawyers handle the litigation process and understand all of the ins and outs of the courtroom. A litigation lawyer can also help you decide whether your case is appropriate for a lawsuit, or if it might be better handled through the mediation or arbitration process. The litigation lawyer will research the facts that caused the dispute, and analyze them to identify the appropriate law and how it applies. After this preliminary review, the litigation lawyer gives you an analysis of your rights and an estimate of your ability to be successful in court. The litigation lawyer will know the information you need to present in court as well as the process, procedures, and deadlines you must meet to keep your lawsuit on track.Litigation lawyers in cities near Brooklyn, NYAstoriaBronxFlushingJamaicaJersey CityLong Island CityNew YorkNewarkPatersonStaten IslandTinton FallsYonkersSee all cities in New York Brooklyn, NY attorneys in related practice areasPersonal Injury Lawyers Brooklyn, NYLawsuit / Dispute Attorneys Brooklyn, NYAppeals Lawyers Brooklyn, NYClass Action Attorneys Brooklyn, NYSee all practice areas Brooklyn, NY attorneys by top languagesSpanishFrenchMandarinSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Judy L.
