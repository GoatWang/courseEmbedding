1136 S. Wabash Ave., Chicago
Chicago—CA Residential LLC, the multifamily investment and development division of  CA Ventures, in a joint venture with K Giles LLC, announced it has started construction on a 320-unit mixed-use development.
Located at 1136 S. Wabash Ave. in Chicago’s South Loop, the finished project will be a 26-story tower including 320 luxury apartments, 5,000 square feet of street-level retail space and 141 parking spaces. The apartments will consist of 160 studios, 80 one-bedroom units and 80 two-bedroom units, with floor plans ranging from 389 to 1,027 square feet on floors six through 25.
“Chicago’s South Loop is one of the fastest growing neighborhoods in the city and this building will be located on a very important corner in this neighborhood,” JJ Smith, COO of CA Ventures, told Multi-Housing News. “Between the nearby transit hub, a Trader Joe’s market across the street and the easy access to Chicago’s cultural and lifestyle attractions, there are few locations with a similar combination of neighborhood amenities. The location also offers proximity to a dozen of the city’s higher education institutions and Chicago’s loop business district. This combination will be a draw for renters across the demographic spectrum, ranging from college students and young professionals to downsizers seeking a convenient, urban lifestyle.”
Each apartment will feature high-end kitchens with contemporary cabinetry, full-height, ceramic wall tiles in the bathrooms, quartz countertops with glass tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances, Grohe plumbing fixtures throughout, in-unit washers and dryers, floor-to-ceiling windows and private balconies on select units.
“There is a level of affordability that 1136 S. Wabash will bring to Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood. With studio units making up half the composition of the building’s 320 units, we are able to offer renters-by-choice an amenity-rich environment at attainable price points,” added Smith.
Rooftop deck rendering, which will offer 360-degree views of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.
Offering more than 22,000 square feet of amenity space, the property will include a rooftop deck with multiple landscaped terraces, an outdoor pool and spa, a business center, an entertainment suite, a pet grooming station, seating areas, a state-of-the-art fitness center and yoga studio, meeting pods, a media and gaming room and an outdoor dog run.
The project is scheduled for completion in May 2018 and will be managed by The Habitat Company. Lendlease will oversee construction on the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed tower. According to Smith, CA Ventures is expecting a two year stabilization period with a target of 30 to 40 percent pre-leased prior to first move-ins.

Joint venture breaks ground on new 26-story apartment tower in Chicago’s South Loop











November 3, 2016Newsletter 


A joint venture consisting of K Giles LLC and the multifamily investment and development arm of CA Ventures, CA Residential LLC, has broken ground on a 320-unit, mixed-use development in Chicago’s South Loop. The 29-story transit-oriented apartment building is scheduled for May 2018 delivery at 1136 S. Wabash Avenue, just feet away from the CTA Roosevelt station. Managed by The Habitat Company, the building will include 320 luxury apartments, 5,000 square feet of street-level retail and parking for 141 vehicles. “The South Loop is one of the city’s fastest-growing neighborhoods and we believe demand for housing in this area will only continue to increase as development pushes farther south,” said JJ Smith, COO of CA Ventures. “With 1136 South Wabash, we’ll be able to transform an underutilized parking lot into a modern mixed-use development that will appeal to a wide range of renters by offering a mix of unit sizes, lifestyle-oriented amenities and an unparalleled location at the epicenter of all the South Loop has to offer.”

The CA Ventures project at Wabash and Roosevelt isn’t a student housing project, after all, according to the public relations agency representing the project.





“You had posted a story in early October citing the development as student housing while it is in fact a residential, multifamily rental building which will be open to anyone looking for a highly amenitized – yet attainably priced – rental residence. Lendlease is overseeing construction of the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed tower,” wrote Sara Picchioni Williams, a senior account executive at Taylor Johnson.
Here is a link to the originally published article from October, based on building permit data and previously published material:
Lend Lease (US) builds $58.05 million student housing project at Wabash and Roosevelt

However, recently Williams provided a news release telling the story the way the developers want it to be shared:
CA Ventures and K Giles LLC Announce Start of Construction on 26-Story Mixed-Use Tower in Chicago’s South Loop
Transit-oriented development 1136 South Wabash to include 320 luxury apartments, 5,000 square feet of retail
CHICAGO (October 28, 2016) — CA Residential LLC, the multifamily investment and development division of Chicago-based CA Ventures, in a joint venture with Chicago-based K Giles LLC, announced it has commenced construction on a 320-unit mixed-use development at 1136 S. Wabash Ave. in Chicago’s South Loop. Located steps from the CTA Roosevelt station, which serves the CTA’s Red, Green and Orange lines, the transit-oriented project is scheduled to deliver in May 2018 and will be managed by Chicago-based The Habitat Company.
“The South Loop is one of the city’s fastest-growing neighborhoods and we believe demand for housing in this area will only continue to increase as development pushes farther south,” said J.J. Smith, COO of CA Ventures. “With 1136 South Wabash, we’ll be able to transform an underutilized parking lot into a modern mixed-use development that will appeal to a wide range of renters by offering a mix of unit sizes, lifestyle-oriented amenities and an unparalleled location at the epicenter of all the South Loop has to offer.”
When complete, the 26-story tower will include 320 luxury apartments, 5,000 sq. ft. of street-level retail and parking for 141 vehicles. Residences at 1136 South Wabash, located on floors six through 25, will include 160 studios, 80 one-bedroom/one-bath units and 80 two-bedroom/two-bath units, with floor plans ranging in size from 389 to 1,027 sq. ft.
Each apartment will feature high-end kitchens with contemporary cabinetry, quartz countertops with glass tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances; full-height, ceramic wall tile in baths; Grohe plumbing fixtures throughout; and in-unit washer and dryer. Floor-to-ceiling windows will showcase sweeping views of the downtown skyline and Lake Michigan from nearly every residence. Select units will also feature private balconies.
“We’ve learned that renters want all of the amenities and high-end finishes that today’s luxury apartment towers have to offer but at a more attainable price point,” said Smith. “With units starting under $1,500 per month, 1136 South Wabash will present a relative value compared with other newly developed residential communities in the South Loop.”
In addition to well-appointed residences, 1136 South Wabash will boast more than 22,000 square feet of amenity space, including a rooftop deck with multiple landscaped terraces, seating areas, and an outdoor pool and spa. The building’s fifth floor will house a state-of-the-art fitness center and yoga studio; business center; meeting pods; entertainment suite; media and gaming rooms; pet grooming station; and outdoor dog run.
Residents will also enjoy the convenience of nearby restaurants and retail, including a Trader Joe’s grocery store across the street from the building. And, more than 300 acres of green space will be within walking distance of the community.
“1136 South Wabash is located just north of Wabash and Roosevelt, the heart of the vibrant South Loop neighborhood,” said Keith Giles, principal, K Giles LLC. “There is no other property in the neighborhood that compares to this location with its convenient access to the neighborhood’s most popular shopping, dining and entertainment destinations, not to mention it’s just steps from Grant Park, the Museum Campus and Lake Michigan.”
Lendlease, one of the world’s largest development, property, infrastructure and construction management firms, will oversee construction of the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed tower.
“We are excited to have been selected as the general contractor for this project and to have the opportunity to contribute to the growth of the South Loop’s residential market,” said Jeffrey Riemer, executive vice-president and executive general manager of Lendlease.

SOUTH LOOP — Developer Keith Giles is the latest builder joining the South Loop construction boom. Giles unveiled plans last week for the 24-story, 320-unit apartment tower he wants to build at 1136-40 S. Wabash Ave. And he's hopping on a national trend: Half of those units will be studio "quasi-micro" apartments."We’re trying to meet the demands of younger people that would rather live alone and can only afford under $2,000" rent, Giles said.The project by Giles and Chicago-based partner CA Ventures is the newest addition to a Downtown neighborhood replete with high-profile developments proposed this year. Though Giles' proposed mid-rise won't rise as tall as other proposals in the area, he does believe the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed tower will improve the South Loop. His development site is a city-owned parking lot.

[Solomon Cordwell Buenz]The tower would also include interior parking, street-level retail and a rooftop bar. Giles, a veteran developer, also recently partnered with CA Ventures on the conversion of the Old Colony Building, 407 S. Dearborn St., to dorm-style apartments aimed at students.Deborah Soehlig, president of the Greater South Loop Association that hosted the meeting Nov. 2, said Friday the proposal seemed to be received well by its audience, but her group had yet to tabulate results from a survey handed out after Giles' presentation.The Giles/CA venture is under contract to buy the site from the city for $4.4 million. Giles said his $64-million project does not require a zoning change, and he plans to file for a building permit in January. He expects the tower will open by the end of 2017. For more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:
