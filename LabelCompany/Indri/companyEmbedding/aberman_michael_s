What are analysts saying about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, continues to drive revenues and the company is expanding the drug's label for additional indications. The FDA’s approval of Dupixent was a major boost to the company’s portfolio and Regeneron is evaluating the drug for additional indications like asthma. The approval of Kevzara (sarilumab) for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis both in the U.S.and EU will further diversify the company’s portfolio. On the other hand, although sales of Praluent have failed to impress due to the present payer utilization management restrictions in the U.S. and limited market access in Europe, the drug is expected to have blockbuster potential. Shares of the company have also outperformed the industry in the year so far." (7/4/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "REGN reported Q1:17 U.S." (5/5/2017)
3. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We raise our price target to $412 but maintain our Market Perform rating on REGN following Dupixent approval in adult atopic dermatitis. While the approval was widely expected and reflects the strength of Dupixent's clinical profile, we believe the $37k gross price (~$30k net) is higher than expected (BMO: ~$25k prior) and could lead to even more aggressive management by payors. Thus, while we have updated our model to reflect Dupixent's actual price, we have slowed our ramp on our expectation for increased access restrictions given the therapy's high price." (3/28/2017)
4. Robert W. Baird analysts commented, "We surveyed 30 dermatologists treating ~134 moderate-to-severe AD patients each on their expectations around the launches for Pfizer's Eucrisa and Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent, set for approval tomorrow. Docs highlighted the significant need for new mechanisms and therapeutic alternatives. Importantly, physician sentiment points to a market for Dupixent of about 300,000-350,000 patients, in line with management's expectations. We wouldn't be surprised to see an exceptionally strong launch here, but we continue to point out that consensus expectations are already building that in." (3/28/2017)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 15 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.42)Consensus Price Target: $472.96 (7.89% downside)
