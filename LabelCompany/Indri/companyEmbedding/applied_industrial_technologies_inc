This is the place to go for Industrial Parts and Services in the South Bay!  My Company needed to replace a couple small bearings on a Motor and these guys were very helpful.  This place used to be called King Bearing.







Ordered some repair parts and was delighted by the $8.54 shipping charge on the purchase contract. Was shocked to see the actual invoice shipping charge was $40.89 which more than doubled the cost of the order. I emailed them about the excessive shipping charge. They responded by stealing their invoice back out of my inbox and boosting the shipping charge to $46.71! This used to be a great outfit. It's a pity.

This is the place to go for Industrial Parts and Services in the South Bay!  My Company needed to replace a couple small bearings on a Motor and these guys were very helpful.  This place used to be called King Bearing.

Updated review



Ordered some repair parts and was delighted by the $8.54 shipping charge on the purchase contract. Was shocked to see the actual invoice shipping charge was $40.89 which more than doubled the cost of the order. I emailed them about the excessive shipping charge. They responded by stealing their invoice back out of my inbox and boosting the shipping charge to $46.71! This used to be a great outfit. It's a pity.

I called for a special small bottle of Loctite. They told me that if I ordered y 4pm, it would here the next day, which it was. Excellent service and ordering the equivalent on Amazon would have been 10$ more expensive and more wait. If you need Loctite products for personal or industrial use, call them!

I called for a special small bottle of Loctite. They told me that if I ordered y 4pm, it would here the next day, which it was. Excellent service and ordering the equivalent on Amazon would have been 10$ more expensive and more wait. If you need Loctite products for personal or industrial use, call them!

Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT) a public, American company focused on the manufacture and sale of industrial (including automotive) parts and fluid power components; it also provides modification, repair and installation services for industrial rubber components, such as conveyor belts and hoses.[2]
Company history[edit]
Joseph M. Bruening founded Applied Industrial Technologies, then called the Ohio Ball Bearing Company, in 1923.[3] First year sales totaled $82,000. Over the next few decades, new branches opened and sales rose steadily.
In 1953, the company was renamed Bearings, Inc. As acquisitions were made (Dixie Bearings, Inc., King Bearing, Inc., Mainline Industrial Distributors, Inc.), the company’s product and service offering grew. Bearings, Inc. became an authorized distributor for bearings, power transmission supplies, fluid power components and industrial rubber products.
In 1995, Bearings, Inc. recorded more than a billion dollars in sales for the first time. Acquisitions were made in 1996 (Engineered Sales, Inc.) and 1997 (Invetech Company (parent company of Detroit Ball Bearing, American Bearing and Power Transmission, Moore Bearing, Kentucky Bearing Service and Hewitt Transmission)).
The company’s name was changed to Applied Industrial Technologies in 1997.
Since 1998, Applied has continued to make acquisitions, expanding further in the U.S. (Minnesota Bearing Company, Cincinnati Transmission) but also increasing its presence in Puerto Rico (Rafael Benitez Carrillo), Mexico (Baleros Industriales, S.A. de C.V., Rodamientos y Bandas de la Laguna, S.A. de C.V., VYCMEX S.A. de C.V., Suministros Industriales Enol, S.A. de C.V.) and Canada (Bearing & Transmission, B & T Rubber, HyPOWER Systems, Industrial Equipment Co. Ltd., Groupe GLM,). Through acquisitions (Spencer Industries, Inc., Bay Advanced Technologies, Carolina Fluid Components, DTS Fluid Power, FluidTech, Hughes HiTech, Hydro Air and Power Systems), Applied has also grown its offering of fluid power products and services.[4]

Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT) a public, American company focused on the manufacture and sale of industrial (including automotive) parts and fluid power components; it also provides modification, repair and installation services for industrial rubber components, such as conveyor belts and hoses.[2]
Company history[edit]
Joseph M. Bruening founded Applied Industrial Technologies, then called the Ohio Ball Bearing Company, in 1923.[3] First year sales totaled $82,000. Over the next few decades, new branches opened and sales rose steadily.
In 1953, the company was renamed Bearings, Inc. As acquisitions were made (Dixie Bearings, Inc., King Bearing, Inc., Mainline Industrial Distributors, Inc.), the company’s product and service offering grew. Bearings, Inc. became an authorized distributor for bearings, power transmission supplies, fluid power components and industrial rubber products.
In 1995, Bearings, Inc. recorded more than a billion dollars in sales for the first time. Acquisitions were made in 1996 (Engineered Sales, Inc.) and 1997 (Invetech Company (parent company of Detroit Ball Bearing, American Bearing and Power Transmission, Moore Bearing, Kentucky Bearing Service and Hewitt Transmission)).
The company’s name was changed to Applied Industrial Technologies in 1997.
Since 1998, Applied has continued to make acquisitions, expanding further in the U.S. (Minnesota Bearing Company, Cincinnati Transmission) but also increasing its presence in Puerto Rico (Rafael Benitez Carrillo), Mexico (Baleros Industriales, S.A. de C.V., Rodamientos y Bandas de la Laguna, S.A. de C.V., VYCMEX S.A. de C.V., Suministros Industriales Enol, S.A. de C.V.) and Canada (Bearing & Transmission, B & T Rubber, HyPOWER Systems, Industrial Equipment Co. Ltd., Groupe GLM,). Through acquisitions (Spencer Industries, Inc., Bay Advanced Technologies, Carolina Fluid Components, DTS Fluid Power, FluidTech, Hughes HiTech, Hydro Air and Power Systems), Applied has also grown its offering of fluid power products and services.[4]

Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT) a public, American company focused on the manufacture and sale of industrial (including automotive) parts and fluid power components; it also provides modification, repair and installation services for industrial rubber components, such as conveyor belts and hoses.[2]
Company history[edit]
Joseph M. Bruening founded Applied Industrial Technologies, then called the Ohio Ball Bearing Company, in 1923.[3] First year sales totaled $82,000. Over the next few decades, new branches opened and sales rose steadily.
In 1953, the company was renamed Bearings, Inc. As acquisitions were made (Dixie Bearings, Inc., King Bearing, Inc., Mainline Industrial Distributors, Inc.), the company’s product and service offering grew. Bearings, Inc. became an authorized distributor for bearings, power transmission supplies, fluid power components and industrial rubber products.
In 1995, Bearings, Inc. recorded more than a billion dollars in sales for the first time. Acquisitions were made in 1996 (Engineered Sales, Inc.) and 1997 (Invetech Company (parent company of Detroit Ball Bearing, American Bearing and Power Transmission, Moore Bearing, Kentucky Bearing Service and Hewitt Transmission)).
The company’s name was changed to Applied Industrial Technologies in 1997.
Since 1998, Applied has continued to make acquisitions, expanding further in the U.S. (Minnesota Bearing Company, Cincinnati Transmission) but also increasing its presence in Puerto Rico (Rafael Benitez Carrillo), Mexico (Baleros Industriales, S.A. de C.V., Rodamientos y Bandas de la Laguna, S.A. de C.V., VYCMEX S.A. de C.V., Suministros Industriales Enol, S.A. de C.V.) and Canada (Bearing & Transmission, B & T Rubber, HyPOWER Systems, Industrial Equipment Co. Ltd., Groupe GLM,). Through acquisitions (Spencer Industries, Inc., Bay Advanced Technologies, Carolina Fluid Components, DTS Fluid Power, FluidTech, Hughes HiTech, Hydro Air and Power Systems), Applied has also grown its offering of fluid power products and services.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
