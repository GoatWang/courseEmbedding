Draper Associates closes $190 million seed fund - Brings on outside investors for the first time



 11th April 2016
 Draper Associates




April, 11th, 2016 - San Mateo, CA - Tim Draper, founder of DFJ and the Draper Venture Network and early investor in Skype, Baidu, Tesla, TwitchTV, Hotmail, Cruise Automation, and Thumbtack, announced today that he’s closed a $190 million early stage venture fund under the brand Draper Associates.
                          

                            Draper Associates has historically been a personal investment vehicle for Draper, and this fund represents the first time the opportunity has been offered to outside LPs. “We believe that the venture capital business and finance generally is going through a transformation and we raised this fund to lead that change,” said Draper. “We have created an ecosystem that we believe will give Draper-backed entrepreneurs an edge as they build their businesses.”
                          

                            The fund will focus primarily on leading early-stage investments, with the ability to support companies with follow-on rounds in certain cases. The fund targets the “Global Silicon Valley,” where new technologies are transforming our world. Draper lists FinTech, GovTech, Healthcare, Education, Insurance and Logistics as ‘ripe for transformation,’ and says that the fund is open to any entrepreneur who is willing to challenge the status quo.
                          

                            The core investment team for Draper Associates consists of Tim, Billy Draper, and Andy Tang. The team intends to stay lean and nimble for quick process and decision-making, but expects to work with partners from the Draper Venture Network and select venture partners for additional expertise when needed.
                          

About Draper Associates


Draper Associates is a premiere brand in early-stage venture capital. The entrepreneur-centric firm has built a reputation for venture capital that encourages entrepreneurs to drive their businesses to greatness, to transform industries with new technologies, and to build platforms for extraordinary growth, jobs, and wealth creation.

California Guide
                  Despite its nearly 40 million residents, some regions of California remain happily untouched. Indeed, any travel guide will tout the state’s wide-open wilderness areas as among the best things to see. Dotted with broad meadows, thundering waterfalls, and giant sequoia trees, Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountain range is a magnet for hikers and climbers. Further south in the Sierra range, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks attract nature enthusiasts with white-water rivers, densely forested hiking trails, and the towering General Sherman—one of the largest living trees on Earth.

For all of its natural wonders, California is perhaps best known for its two iconic world capitals. The General Sherman, after all, wouldn’t even reach the halfway point of San Francisco’s Transamerica Pyramid, and it would be lost among the forest of sleek structures that compose L.A.’s iconic skyline. The City by the Bay has earned its reputation as a global arts capital, thanks to a profusion of downtown galleries and world-class museums such as the SFMOMA and the De Young. While visiting the latter in Golden Gate Park, leave time for a stroll through the picturesque Japanese Tea Garden.

Southern California is all about entertainment—from Hollywood’s star-studded Walk of Fame to the themed rides and attractions at parks such as Disneyland and Universal Studios. A visit to Universal even comes with a behind-the-scenes tour that features back-lot views of famous movie sets. Visitors to the theme park can also spend time at CityWalk free of charge, where they can engage in some of L.A.’s finest shopping, dining and club-hopping.

California Guide

Despite its nearly 40 million residents, some regions of California remain happily untouched. Indeed, any travel guide will tout the state’s wide-open wilderness areas as among the best things to see. Dotted with broad meadows, thundering waterfalls, and giant sequoia trees, Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountain range is a magnet for hikers and climbers. Further south in the Sierra range, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks attract nature enthusiasts with white-water rivers, densely forested hiking trails, and the towering General Sherman—one of the largest living trees on Earth.For all of its natural wonders, California is perhaps best known for its two iconic world capitals. The General Sherman, after all, wouldn’t even reach the halfway point of San Francisco’s Transamerica Pyramid, and it would be lost among the forest of sleek structures that compose L.A.’s iconic skyline. The City by the Bay has earned its reputation as a global arts capital, thanks to a profusion of downtown galleries and world-class museums such as the SFMOMA and the De Young. While visiting the latter in Golden Gate Park, leave time for a stroll through the picturesque Japanese Tea Garden.Southern California is all about entertainment—from Hollywood’s star-studded Walk of Fame to the themed rides and attractions at parks such as Disneyland and Universal Studios. A visit to Universal even comes with a behind-the-scenes tour that features back-lot views of famous movie sets. Visitors to the theme park can also spend time at CityWalk free of charge, where they can engage in some of L.A.’s finest shopping, dining and club-hopping.
