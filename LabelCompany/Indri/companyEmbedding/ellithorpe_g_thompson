Thompson was founded by William Thompson in 1932 with a line of single vitamins. To ensure quality and purity, Thompson products were manufactured in house at the company's manufacturing facilities in Crenshaw, California. In keeping with Thompson's philosophy that supplements should be as clean, pure and as natural as possible, the Thompson brand was one of the first to abandon the use of coal tar and synthetic dyes that were standard in the industry in the early years.
The Thompson product line now includes around 200 products, from vitamins and minerals to herbs and specialty supplements. Herbspro.com is proud to carry the entire range of this fine brand.
