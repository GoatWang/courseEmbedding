About Us


The Denali Program, traded by Mike Wanninger, utilizes discretionary,    
fundamentally managed futures and options strategies that focus on all    
agricultural grain markets. Proprietary methodology is used to identify    
potential trading opportunities while keeping the margin to equity ratio to less    
than 10%. Mr. Wanninger, has spent his entire life involved in production    
agriculture. He grew up on a small farm in western Iowa and currently owns    
and operates an extensive farming operation in east central Illinois. He is    
currently a Regional Director of INTL FC Stone, LLC and has over thirty of    
experience in commercial grain hedging, renewable fuels risk management,    
and the over-the-counter grain strategic development divisions of INTL FC    
Stone for the Illinois region.  Mr. Wanninger takes a conservative approach    
with his trading methodology through the use of futures options and spreads    
with a trading bias based upon nearly 30 years of experience in managing    
directional risk exposure and cash grain execution for commercial grain    
industry clients throughout the United States. In additional to his underlying    
fundamental approach in trading the Denali Program extensive use of technical    
analysis is used to more precisely enter and exit strategies.
