        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

The Comprehensive Assessment comprises two main quantitative pillars, namely the Asset Quality Review and the Stress Test.The Asset Quality Review aimed to review the quality of banks' assets, including the adequacy of asset and collateral valuation and related provisions as of 31 December 2013. The Stress Test examined the banks' ability to withstand two hypothetical scenarios in 2014-2016. The two scenarios - the "baseline" scenario and the "adverse" scenario - are those published by the EBA on 29 April 2014.The results of the Comprehensive Assessment published on 26 October 2014 show that the six Luxembourg institutions, that were directly subject to the Comprehensive Assessment, pass the reference thresholds set by the ECBfor the Comprehensive Assessment, i.e. 8% CET1 ratio2 for the Asset Quality Review and 5.5% CET1 ratio for the Stress Test (under the adverse scenario). Further to the Asset Quality Review and the Stress Test, the CET1%solvency ratios of the six Luxembourg institutions remain above 8%, a level that is comfortably above the 5.5% CET1%threshold for the Stress Test set by the ECB. As a consequence, no capital shortfall has been identified for the six Luxembourg institutions3. The results from the standalone Asset Quality Review confirm that the six Luxembourg institutions' assets are appropriately valued and additional prudential provisions are limited. The Stress Test results show that the six institutions are sufficiently resilient to withstand the two hypothetical Stress Test scenarios.The complete Comprehensive Assessment results, including background information, can be obtained from the ECBwebsite at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/ssm/assessment/html/index.en.html.

(Holding of Banque Internationale   Luxembourg and KBL European Private Bankers S.A.)RBC Investor Services Bank S.A.State Street Bank Luxembourg S.A.UBS (Luxembourg) S.A.Since the Comprehensive Assessment is carried out at the highest level of consolidation in participating Member States, the Luxembourg branches and subsidiaries of European banks included in the Comprehensive Assessment are indirectly covered, through the inclusion of the Luxembourg based activities in the consolidated figures of their parent companies.Besides Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat, Luxembourg and Precision Capital S.A., there are a number of subsidiaries and branches from EU banks that serve the domestic retail market. These institutions are (in alphabetical order) Banque BCP S.A. (Luxembourg subsidiary of the French banking group BPCE), Banque de Luxembourg S.A., BGL BNP Paribas, Caixa Geral de Dep³sitos SA, Lisboa (Portugal) (Luxembourg branch) and ING Luxembourg. As a result of the Comprehensive Assessment, no capital shortfall has been identified at the level of the parent companies of these branches and subsidiaries.Resources allocated to the Comprehensive Assessment in LuxembourgThe Comprehensive Assessment required significant resources at the national level. At the CSSF, 20 staff members were permanently involved in the Comprehensive Assessment over the course of the last year. An additional dozen staff members worked for 4 to 6 months on quality assurance with respect to the Asset Quality Review or the Stress Test results. Given that the Asset Quality Review was conducted as a targeted and risk-based exercise focusing on the portfolios with the highest chance of material misstatements, only three Luxembourg institutions4 underwent a Credit File Review. Following sampling, some 1,400 debtors were analysed during the Credit File Review and 800 collateral items valued. Furthermore, 24 collective provisioning challenger models were built and 90 level three non-derivative assets re-valued. The Asset Quality Review also involved third-party audit firms, chosen through a public procurement procedure. At the level of these third parties, more than 100 additional auditors contributed to the execution of the Asset Quality Review.ï® GLOBAL SITUATION OF UNDERTAKINGS FOR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT ANDSPECIALISED INVESTMENT FUNDS AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2014Press release 14/55 of 24 October 2014I.

A total of 2,532 entities have adopted an umbrella structure, which represents 12,431 sub-funds. When adding the 1,368 entities with a traditional structure to that figure, a total of 13,799 entities are active in the financial centre.As regards, on the one hand, the impact of financial markets on Luxembourg UCIs and SIFs (hereafter "UCIs") and, on the other hand, the net capital investment in these UCIs, the following can be said about September 2014.The categories of equity UCIs did not develop homogeneously during the month under review.Thus, in Europe, due to a rebound of industrial activity in some countries and the expansive monetary measures decided by the European Central Bank, the category of European equity UCIs closed the month with price increases.While US equity markets slightly fell despite positive economic data, the category of US equity UCIs nonetheless finished the month in positive territory, as a result, inter alia, of the substantial 4.81% rise of the USD against the EUR.The positive economic data in the United States, the continuing expansive monetary policy in Japan, as well as the depreciation of the yen against the US dollar, had a positive impact on the category of Japanese equity UCIs.The category of Asian equity UCIs saw some slight gains as the stock market losses were offset by the appreciation of the Asian currencies against the euro. Value losses were recorded for Eastern European and Latin American equity UCIs, the scale of the losses for the latter being related to the political and economic uncertainties in Brazil.In September, equity UCI categories registered an overall positive net capital investment.Development of equity UCIs during the month of September 2014*Market variation in %Net issues in %Global market equities0.64%0.42%European equities0.17%-0.57%US equities2.52%-1.44%Japanese equities3.64%0.74%Eastern European equities-1.85%-1.37%Asian equities0.76%0.69%Latin American equities-8.65%-0.12%Other equities-1.31%0.08%* Variation in % of Net Assets in EUR as compared to the previous monthCSSF Newsletter - November 201415Commission de Surveillance du Secteur FinancierAs regards the category of EUR-denominated bond UCIs, the return of long-term government bonds remained broadly unchanged, as the decisions of the European Central Bank to decrease key interest rates and to launch the asset buy-back programme had only a weak impact on bond markets. Furthermore, private sector risk premiums remained relatively stable. Overall, EUR-denominated bond UCIs registered a slight fall in prices during the month under review.In the United States, the positive economic figures and the prospect of a more restrictive monetary policy of the American Federal Reserve made yields of the US bonds, as well as the exchange rate of the USD against the other currencies, climb, which resulted in a rise in the prices of bonds denominated in USD.Given the global growth problems, risk premiums of emerging market bonds increased slightly.

        AUDA is a potent inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase
        

        Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase by AUDA inhibits the metabolism of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and protects end-organs against the damaging effects of salt-sensitive hypertension. AUDA also renders protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and cerebral ischemia.


        		Packaging
				
				

        10, 50 mg in glass bottle
        

        		Application
				
				

        AUDA may be used in soluble epoxide hydrolase-mediated cell signaling studies.
