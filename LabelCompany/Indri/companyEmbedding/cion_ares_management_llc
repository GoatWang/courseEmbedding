About Ares
Market Leader. Experienced Team. Flexible Approach.
Ares Management, L.P. (“Ares” or the “Firm”) is a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager with approximately $100 billion of assets under management ("AUM") and approximately 955 employees. We seek to deliver attractive performance to our investor base across our investment groups and strategies, including credit, private equity and real estate. The firm is headquartered in Los Angeles with offices across the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. Its common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ARES".
 
Ares believes each of its investment groups is a market leader based on assets under management and investment performance. Our three distinct but complementary investment groups have the ability to invest in all levels of a company’s capital structure—from senior debt to common equity. The Firm was built upon the fundamental principle that each group benefits from being part of the broader platform. We believe the synergies from this multi-asset strategy provide our professionals with insights into industry trends, access to significant deal flow and the ability to assess relative value.
 
Since our inception in 1997, we have adhered to a disciplined investment philosophy that focuses on delivering compelling risk-adjusted investment returns throughout market cycles. We strive to maintain a consistent credit-based approach in targeting well-structured investments in high quality businesses and real estate assets. We believe our growth in becoming one of the largest alternative asset managers is a testament to our experienced management team, focus on performance and high quality investor base, which includes large pension funds, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, banks and insurance companies.

Experienced Team. Flexible Capital. Resourceful Sponsor.
Our Private Equity Group has achieved compelling risk-adjusted investment returns for a loyal and growing group of high profile limited partners and has approximately $24.7 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2017. Our Private Equity Group broadly categorizes its investment strategies as corporate private equity, special situations and U.S. power and energy infrastructure. Our private equity professionals have a demonstrated ability to deploy flexible capital, which allows them to stay both active and disciplined in various market environments. The group's activities are managed by three dedicated investment teams in North America, Europe and China. The group manages flagship funds focused primarily on North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe, special situations funds, U.S. power and energy infrastructure funds and related co-investment vehicles and a China growth fund.

North American and European Flexible Capital
Our flagship funds pursue opportunistic majority or shared-control investments in businesses with strong franchises and attractive growth opportunities in North America and Europe. We seek investments in companies with strong existing management teams where our capital can unlock value by serving as a catalyst for growth. Learn More >

Special Situations
We invest opportunistically across a broad spectrum of distressed or mispriced investments, including corporate debt, rescue capital, private asset-backed investments, post-reorganization securities and non-performing portfolios. We seek to capitalize on market trends and dislocated assets by flexibly deploying capital, leveraging our deep credit expertise, proprietary research and robust sourcing model.
Learn More >

Ares EIF
Ares EIF targets U.S. power and energy infrastructure across the power generation, transmission and midstream sectors, and seeks attractive risk-adjusted equity returns with current cash flow and capital appreciation. We have a 30 year track record across investment cycles as one of the first managers focused on the independent power and electric utility industry. Learn More >

China Growth Capital
In Greater China, we primarily target minority growth equity investments in high quality companies that operate industries we believe will be the primary drivers of China’s economic growth over the next decade. We seek outstanding management partners that are in need of both growth capital and constructive equity sponsorship to satisfy a range of balance sheet, governance and strategic needs.

Overview

Value Proposition




Key Contacts



Experienced Leadership.  Investment Discipline.  Dependable Partner.
 
Ares Management, L.P.'s ("Ares") Real Estate Group manages comprehensive public and private equity and debt strategies, with approximately $9.9 billion of assets under management  ("AUM") as of March 31, 2017. With its experienced team, along with its expansive network of relationships, our Real Estate Group capitalizes on opportunities across both real estate equity and debt investing. Our Real Estate Group's equity investments focus on implementing hands-on value creation initiatives to mismanaged and capital-starved assets, as well as new development, ultimately selling stabilized assets back into the market. Our debt strategies leverage our Real Estate Group's diverse sources of capital to directly originate and manage commercial mortgage investments on properties that range from stabilized to requiring hands-on value creation. Our Real Estate Group has achieved significant scale in a short period of time through various acquisitions and successful fundraising efforts. Our Real Estate Group provides investors access to its capabilities through several vehicles: a publicly traded commercial mortgage real estate investment trust ("REIT"), Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (NYSE:ACRE), U.S. and European real estate private equity commingled funds and real estate equity and debt separately managed accounts. Our Real Estate Group's activities are managed by dedicated equity and debt teams in the U.S. and Europe.
 
Our Real Estate Group’s senior leadership averages more than 30 years of relevant real estate investment experience. Our Real Estate Group has approximately 75 investment professionals with a global footprint across nine cities across the U.S. and Europe as of March 31, 2017. We believe our multi-asset class experience, global scale and deep property knowledge differentiate us from other investors in the real estate market.
 
Our Real Estate Group leverages the following core capabilities across our platform:

Experienced Leadership—Stable and deep team that has been market cycle-tested and is established in many local markets across the world
Global Market Perspective—Integrating a global market view with local market knowledge and fundamental asset analysis
Multi-Channel Sourcing—Deep connectivity into local property networks, leading to off-market deal flow
In-House Research—Corporate and industry research to identify and capitalize on market trends

 
Real Estate Equity
 
Our real estate equity team has extensive private equity and property experience in the United States and Europe. Our real estate equity team has approximately 55 investment professionals across six offices and primarily invests in new developments and the repositioning of assets, with a focus on control or majority-control investments. Our real estate equity team primarily targets the United States and Europe. As of March 31, 2017, our real estate equity team advised 39 investment vehicles totaling, in aggregate, approximately $7.2 billion in AUM. Primary areas of focus for our Real Estate Group equity teams include:
 
Real Estate Equity Value-Add Strategy: Our U.S. and European value-add funds focus on undermanaged and under-funded assets, seeking to create value by buying assets at attractive valuations as well as through active asset management of income-producing property types, including multifamily, retail, office, hotel and industrial properties across the United States and Western Europe.
 
Real Estate Equity Opportunistic Strategy: Our U.S. and European opportunistic real estate funds capitalize on increased investor demand for developed and stabilized assets by focusing on manufacturing core assets through development, redevelopment and fixing distressed capital structures across all major property types including multifamily, hotel, office, retail and industrial properties across the United States and Europe.
 
Real Estate Debt
 
Our real estate debt team of approximately 20 professionals directly originates and invests in a wide range of self-originated financing opportunities for middle-market owners and operators of U.S. commercial real estate. As of March 31, 2017, our real estate debt team advised two investment vehicles totalling, in the aggregate, approximately $2.8 billion in AUM. 
 
In addition to managing private funds, we make investments through a specialty finance company, ACRE, primarily focused on directly originating, managing and servicing a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate (“CRE”) debt-related investments. As of March 31, 2017, ACRE had an investment portfolio of approximately $1.4 billion in commitments. ACRE is managed by Ares Commercial Real Estate Management LLC, a subsidiary of Ares.
 
Our Real Estate Debt team focuses on directly originating loans using its extensive national relationships with various owner-operators, sponsors and intermediaries of real estate properties.  We seek to provide flexible financing across a potential borrower’s capital structure.  While we focus on self-originated transactions, we will also selectively pursue secondary market acquisitions and club/syndicated transactions.
 
The following highlights our lending strategy:

Pursue strong risk-adjusted returns by investing in what we believe to be the most attractive position in a given capital structure
Drive internal deal flow primarily through direct origination
Emphasize flexible transactions where our competitive advantages are strongest
Actively manage portfolio through rated special servicer
Lead transactions and remain an active investor
Leverage the power of the Ares platform

 
We believe our principal orientation, flexibility and non-bureaucratic approach differentiate us from other debt capital providers in the commercial real estate middle market. In addition to offering senior and subordinated debt products, we actively provide “stretch senior”, transitional senior and bridge loans in order to customize financing solutions for the specific transaction needs of our clients.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
