Fund Report (unaudited)  For the six months ended December 31, 2013       
Market Conditions  For municipal governments in general, the
economic picture began to brighten in 2013 but the recovery has been progressing at a slow pace. Fiscal strains have softened and many state and local governments have been able to achieve budgetary balance through a combination of cost cutting and
revenue enhancement measures.  Municipal credit quality has continued to improve as most states and many local governments have recovered slowly from
the recession. In particular, state general funds have shown consecutive quarters of growth in personal income tax and sales tax revenue, both important sources of revenue.  Preliminary data from the Rockefeller Institute indicate that while state tax revenue growth slowed in the third quarter of 2013, year-over-year growth was 6.1 percent and personal income tax revenue growth
was 5.3 percent year-over-year. In most states, the overall trend in tax collections for fiscal year 2014 is expected to be positive.  Strong demand for
Variable Rate Demand Notes (VRDNs) has kept short-term tax-exempt rates steady. News in December that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would begin tapering its quantitative easing policy has not had a prominent impact on the short-term municipal market.
 On the year, long-term municipal issuance fell 13 percent in 2013, Thomson Reuters numbers showed. For 2013, $329.8 billion reached the market in
11,267 deals, against $379.6 in 13,115 issues in 2012. Short-term variable-rate short-put issuance slowed 21.7 percent in 2013 to $13.9 billion down from $17.8 billion in 2012.  The state of California saw some improvements during the year. According to the California Legislative Analysts Office, under current policies, California could end the 2014-2015 fiscal year with a $5.6
billion reserve. Assuming continued economic growth in future years, the office projects that revenues will grow faster than expenditures through 2017-2018, when the states projected operating surpluses reach $9.6 billion. 
Income taxes in the most populous U.S. state, fueled largely by capital gains from the performance of the stock market, provide the biggest share of revenue.
Voters in 2012 raised income tax rates to 13.3 percent on those making $1 million or more, the most of any state, and boosted sales levies.  Many of
Californias cities, counties, and school districts have reached the bottom of the credit cycle and are on the path to recovery. Although this outlook is largely driven by the continued improvement at the state level, there are a variety of
local economic and budgetary factors that are also contributing to this view abate.  California may see its credit rating raised if Governor Jerry Brown
persists in paying down debt and revenue continues to outpace spending, according to Standard & Poors (S&P). In early 2013, S&P had raised the most indebted U.S. states rating to A, its sixth-highest level, in January,
saying policy makers had made strides toward improving Californias fiscal health. Continued improvement in the States credit could add to the stability of local credits, especially counties and school districts that rely heavily on state
transfers to fund their operations.

Performance Analysis  As of December 31, 2013, Active Assets California Tax-Free Trust had
net assets of approximately $2.2 billion and an average portfolio maturity of 22 days. For the six-month period ended December 31, 2013, the Fund provided a total return of 0.01 percent. For the seven-day period ended December 31,
2013, the Fund provided an effective annualized yield of 0.01 percent (subsidized) and 0.44 percent (non-subsidized) and a current yield of 0.01 percent (subsidized) and 0.44 percent (non-subsidized), while its 30-day moving average
yield for December was 0.01 percent (subsidized) and 0.44 percent (non-subsidized). Yield quotations more closely reflect the current earnings of the Fund. The non-subsidized yield reflects what the yield would have been had a fee and/or
expense waiver not been in place during the period shown. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 
In the current environment of near-zero interest rates and halting improvement in municipal economies, our strategy has placed an emphasis on maintaining high
levels of liquidity with diligent oversight of credit quality, portfolio maturity and diversification. Daily and weekly VRDOs make up approximately two-thirds of the portfolio. An additional component is allocated to longer variable-rate securities
and the balance of the portfolio is invested in tax-exempt commercial paper and fixed-rate municipal notes and short-maturity bonds. The portfolios weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life (WAL) were 22 and 23 days,
respectively, at month-end.  The tentative state of the economic recovery and the recent pressures in the long-term fixed income markets call for a
watchful approach in the period ahead. We will carefully monitor developments on the state and local government front. We believe that the Fed will maintain short-term interest rates at exceptionally low levels until there is clear evidence that the
economy is on solid footing.  There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as discussed herein or that securities in such
sectors will be held by the Fund in the future.

    Investment Strategy  The Fund will invest in high quality, short-term securities that are normally municipal
obligations that pay interest exempt from federal and California personal income taxes. The Adviser Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., seeks to maintain the Funds share price at $1.00. The Adviser generally invests
substantially all of the Funds assets in California municipal obligations and the Fund has a fundamental policy of investing at least 80 percent of its net assets in securities the interest on which is exempt from federal and California
personal income tax. This policy may not be changed without shareholder approval. In addition, the Fund may invest up to 20 percent of its net assets in securities that pay interest income subject to the alternative minimum tax, and some
taxpayers may have to pay tax on a Fund distribution of this income. For more information, please refer to the section of the Funds Prospectus entitled Tax Consequences.  An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00
per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund.  For More Information 
About Portfolio Holdings  Each Morgan Stanley fund
provides a complete schedule of portfolio holdings in its semiannual and annual reports within 60 days of the end of the funds second and fourth fiscal quarters. The semiannual reports and the annual reports are filed electronically with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form N-CSRS and Form N-CSR, respectively. Morgan Stanley also delivers the semiannual and annual reports to fund shareholders and makes these reports available on its public web site,
www.morganstanley.com. Each Morgan Stanley fund also files a complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the funds first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q and monthly holdings for each money market fund on Form N-MFP. Morgan
Stanley does not deliver these reports to shareholders, nor are the first and third fiscal quarter reports posted to the Morgan Stanley public web site. However, the holdings for each money market fund are posted to the Morgan Stanley public web
site. You may obtain the Form N-Q filings (as well as the Form N-CSR, N-CSRS and N-MFP filings) by accessing the SECs web site, http://www.sec.gov. You may also review and copy them at the SECs public reference room in Washington, DC.
Information on the operation of the SECs public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330. You can also request copies of these materials, upon payment of a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the
SECs e-mail address (publicinfo@sec.gov) or by writing the public reference section of the SEC, Washington, DC 20549-1520.  Householding Notice  To reduce printing and mailing costs, the Fund attempts to eliminate duplicate mailings
to the same address. The Fund delivers a single copy of certain shareholder documents, including shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxy materials, to investors with the same last name who reside at the same address. Your participation in this
program will continue for an unlimited period of time unless you instruct us otherwise. You can request multiple copies of these documents by calling (800) 548-7786, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., ET. Once our Customer Service Center has received your
instructions, we will begin sending individual copies for each account within 30 days.

value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your
account during this period.  Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes  The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical expenses based on the Funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the
Funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing cost of investing in the
Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.  Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only. Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs, and will not help you determine the
relative total cost of owning different funds that have transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads) or exchange fees.

 Expenses are equal to the Funds annualized expense ratio of 0.07% multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied by 186@@/365 (to reflect the one-half year period). If the fund had borne all of its expenses, the annualized expense ratio would have been 0.50%.

Active Assets California Tax-Free Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements n December 31, 2013 (unaudited) 
  1. Organization and Accounting Policies 
Active Assets California Tax-Free Trust (the Fund) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Act), as a
diversified, open-end management investment company. The Funds investment objective is to provide a high level of daily income exempt from federal and California personal income tax as is consistent with stability of principal and liquidity.
The Fund was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on July 10, 1991 and commenced operations on November 12, 1991.  The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies:  A. Valuation of Investments  Portfolio securities are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value, in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the Act. The amortized cost of an instrument is determined by valuing it at its original cost and thereafter amortizing any discount or premium from its face value at a constant rate until
maturity. Investments in mutual funds, including the Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Funds, are valued at the net asset value as of the close of each business day.  B. Accounting for Investments  Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined
by the identified cost method. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized over the life of the respective securities and are included in interest income. Interest income is accrued daily as earned. 
C. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders  Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the close of each business day.
Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid daily. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.  D.
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  E. Indemnifications The Fund enters into contracts
that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
2. Fair Valuation Measurements  Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC
820), defines fair value as the value that the Fund would receive to sell an investment or pay to transfer a liability in a timely transaction with an independent buyer in the principal market, or in the absence of a principal market the most
advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier hierarchy to distinguish between (1) inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in valuing an asset or liability developed based on
market data obtained from 
  16 


Active Assets California Tax-Free Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements n December 31, 2013 (unaudited)  continued   

sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs); and (2) inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use
in valuing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs) and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Various inputs are used in determining
the value of the Funds investments. The inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.   


 

 
 Level 1  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 
 


 

 
 Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
  


 

 
 Level 3  significant unobservable inputs including the Funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments. Factors considered in
making this determination may include, but are not limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange-traded securities), analysis of the issuers financial statements or other
available documents and, if necessary, available information concerning other securities in similar circumstances  The inputs or
methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities and the determination of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment and considers factors specific to each security.  The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Funds investments as
of December 31, 2013.

 Transfers between investment levels may occur as the markets fluctuate and/or the availability of data used in an investments
valuation changes. The Fund recognizes transfers between the levels as of the end of the period. As of December 31, 2013, the Fund did not have any investments transfer between investment levels.

3. Advisory/Administration Agreements  Pursuant to an
Investment Advisory Agreement with Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. (the Adviser), the Fund pays the Adviser an advisory fee, accrued daily and payable monthly, by applying the following annual rates to the net assets of the
Fund determined as of the close of each business day: 0.45% to the portion of the daily net assets not exceeding $500 million; 0.375% to the portion of the daily net assets exceeding $500 million but not exceeding $750 million; 0.325% to the portion
of the daily net assets exceeding $750 million but not exceeding $1 billion; 0.30% to the portion of the daily net assets exceeding $1 billion but not exceeding $1.5 billion; 0.275% to the portion of the daily net assets exceeding $1.5 billion but
not exceeding $2 billion; 0.25% to the portion of the daily net assets exceeding $2 billion but not exceeding $2.5 billion; 0.225% to the portion of the daily net assets exceeding $2.5 billion but not exceeding $3 billion; and 0.20% to the portion
of the daily net assets exceeding $3 billion. For the six months ended December 31, 2013, the advisory fee rate (net of waivers/rebate) was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.01% of the Funds daily net assets. 
Pursuant to an Administration Agreement with Morgan Stanley Services Company Inc. (the Administrator), an affiliate of the Adviser, the Fund pays an
administration fee, accrued daily and payable monthly, by applying the annual rate of 0.05% to the Funds daily net assets.  Under a
Sub-Administration Agreement between the Administrator and State Street Bank and Trust Company (State Street), State Street provides certain administrative services to the Fund. For such services, the Administrator pays State Street a
portion of the fee the Administrator receives from the Fund.  4. Plan of Distribution  Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. (the Distributor), an affiliate of the Adviser and Administrator, is the distributor of the Funds shares and in accordance with a Plan of Distribution (the
Plan) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act, finances certain expenses in connection with the promotion of sales of Fund shares.  Reimbursements for these expenses are made in monthly payments by the Fund to the Distributor, which will in no event exceed an amount equal to a payment at the annual rate of 0.15% of the Funds average daily
net assets during the month. Expenses incurred by the Distributor pursuant to the Plan in any fiscal year will not be reimbursed by the Fund through payments accrued in any subsequent fiscal year. For the six months ended December 31, 2013, the
distribution fee was accrued at the annual rate of 0.10%.  The Distributor, Adviser and Administrator have agreed to waive and/or reimburse all or a
portion of the Funds distribution fee, advisory fee and administration fee, respectively, to the extent that total expenses exceed total income of the Fund on a daily basis. For the six months ended December 31, 2013, the Distributor
waived $1,135,669, the Adviser waived $3,726,577 and the Administrator waived $41,541. These fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year or until such time that

  18 


Active Assets California Tax-Free Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements n December 31, 2013 (unaudited)  continued   

the Funds Board of Trustees, (the Trustees), act to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or expense reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate.
 5. Transactions with Affiliates  The Fund
invests in the Institutional Class of the Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity FundsGovernment Portfolio (the Liquidity Funds), an open-end management investment company managed by the Adviser. Advisory fees paid by the Fund are
reduced by an amount equal to its pro-rata share of the advisory and administration fees paid by the Fund due to its investment in the Liquidity Funds. For the six months ended December 31, 2013, advisory fees paid were reduced by $4,047
relating to the Funds investment in the Liquidity Funds.  A summary of the Funds transactions in shares of the Liquidity Funds during the six
months ended December 31, 2013 is as follows:

 The Fund has an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain independent Trustees of the Fund who will
have served as independent Trustees for at least five years at the time of retirement. Benefits under this plan are based on factors which include years of service and compensation. The Trustees voted to close the plan to new participants and
eliminate the future benefits growth due to increases to compensation after July 31, 2003. Aggregate pension costs for the six months ended December 31, 2013, included in Trustees fees and expenses in the Statement of
Operations amounted to $2,302. At December 31, 2013, the Fund had an accrued pension liability of $57,414, which is included in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. 
The Fund has an unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan (the Compensation Plan), which allows each independent Trustee to defer payment of all, or a
portion, of the fees he or she receives for serving on the Board of Trustees. Each eligible Trustee generally may elect to have the deferred amounts credited with a return equal to the total return on one or more of the Morgan Stanley funds that are
offered as investment options under the Compensation Plan. Appreciation/depreciation and distributions received from these investments are recorded with an offsetting increase/decrease in the deferred compensation obligation and do not affect the
net asset value of the Fund.

 7. Federal Income Tax Status 
It is the Funds intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute all of its taxable and tax-exempt income. Accordingly, no
provision for Federal income taxes is required in the financial statements.  Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.  FASB ASC 740-10, Income Taxes
 Overall, sets forth a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management has concluded there are
no significant uncertain tax positions that would require recognition in the financial statements. If applicable, the Fund recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest Expense and penalties in
Other Expenses in the Statement of Operations. The Fund files tax returns with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, New York and various states. Each of the tax years in the four-year period ended June 30, 2013, remains subject
to examination by taxing authorities.  The tax character of distributions paid may differ from the character of distributions shown in the Statements of
Changes in Net Assets due to short-term capital gains being treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. The tax character of distributions paid during fiscal 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

 The amount and character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from GAAP. These book/tax differences are either considered temporary or permanent in nature. 
  20 


Active Assets California Tax-Free Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements n December 31, 2013 (unaudited)  continued   
Temporary differences are attributable to differing book and tax treatments for the timing of the recognition of gains (losses) on certain investment transactions
and the timing of the deductibility of certain expenses.  Permanent differences, primarily due to nondeductible expenses, resulted in the following
reclassifications among the Funds components of net assets at June 30, 2013:

 At December 31, 2013, the aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is the same as the cost for book purposes. 
8. Accounting Pronouncement  In June 2013, FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update 2013-08 Financial Services  Investment Companies (Topic 946)  Amendments to the Scope, Measurement, and Disclosure Requirements (ASU 2013-08) which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2013. ASU 2013-08 sets forth a methodology for determining whether an
entity should be characterized as an investment company and prescribes fair value accounting for an investment companys non-controlling ownership interest in another investment company. FASB has determined that a fund registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 automatically meets ASU 2013-08s criteria for an investment company. Although still evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2013-08 to the Fund, management expects that the impact of the Funds adoption will
be limited to additional financial statement disclosures.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Trustee Powers

Powers granted to an acting Trustee of this Living Trust include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Trustee will have the same rights and obligations to manage the Property as if the Trustee were the owner of the Property.

The Trustee may lend funds to any borrower where the loan is adequately secured by sufficient collateral and where the loan is reasonable and in the best overall interest of this Living Trust.

The Trustee may make the Final Distribution in any combination of cash and property. Property selection and valuation in the course of the Final Distribution will be made in the good faith discretion of the Trustee and will be binding on all Beneficiaries.

All decisions of the acting Trustee, made in good faith, regarding the management of this Living Trust will be final and binding on all parties.

Homestead Tax Exemption

If the principal residence of the Grantor is held within this Revocable Living Trust, the Grantor maintains the right to possess and inhabit the residence without rent and charge-free, for the duration of their lifetime. This is intended for the purpose of giving the Grantor a beneficial interest and possessor rights in the residence and to ensure that the Grantor does not lose any eligibility for a state homestead tax exemption that they would otherwise qualify for. 

Vote of Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiaries

Where a Beneficiary is a Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary and a vote, consent, or decision of the Qualified Beneficiaries is required, then the parent, custodian or guardian for that Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary, acting in the best interest of that Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary, will be allowed to take the place of that Minor or Adult Dependent Beneficiary for the purpose of that vote, consent, or decision.

Termination of Trust

This Living Trust will terminate where the Property of this Living Trust is exhausted through distributions.

In the event that the acting Trustee concludes that the value of the Property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration and that the aggregate value of the Property is less than $50,000.00 (USD), the acting Trustee may terminate this Living Trust after providing notice to the Qualified Beneficiaries. Where this Living Trust is terminated under this section, the acting Trustee will distribute the Property in a manner consistent with and as described in the distributions sections of this Living Trust.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Trustee Powers

Powers granted to an acting Trustee of this Living Trust include, but are not limited to, the following:

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

Advantages of a living trust



It’s a smart way to avoid probate
Keep more money in the family by avoiding potentially lengthy and expensive court proceedings.

Your affairs get handled if you’re incapacitated
Avoid going to court by appointing a trustee to take charge of your finances according to your instructions.

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?
by Mary S. Yamin-Garone, December 2009





 
 
 
You have worked hard for your money and made every attempt to be a conscientious saver. So it's only natural that you want some control over what happens to your assets after your die. Even if you are a person of modest means, you have an estate—and several strategies to choose from to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes and in a timely fashion: your estate plan. The right strategy depends on your individual circumstances. For some, a living trust can be a useful and practical tool. For others, it may be a waste of time and money. What is a living trust anyway? And how does it differ from a last will?
What Is a Will?
A will is a written document—signed and witnessed—that indicates how your property will be distributed at the time of your death. It is revocable and subject to amendment at any time during your lifetime. It also allows you to appoint a guardian for your minor children. More about writing a will.
What Is a Living Trust?
A living trust provides lifetime and after-death property management. If you are serving as your own trustee, the trust instrument will provide for a successor upon your death or incapacity. Court intervention is not required. Livings trusts also are used to manage property. If a person is disabled by accident or illness, the successor trustee can manage the trust property. As a result, the expense, publicity, and inconvenience of court-supervised distribution of your estate can be avoided.
If a living trust is properly written and funded you can:
Avoid probate on your assets
Plan for the possibility of your own incapacity
Control what happens to your property after you are gone
Use it for any size estate; and
Prevent your financial affairs from becoming a matter of public record
While a trust sounds appealing, there are drawbacks. A living trust is more expensive to set up than a typical will because it must be actively managed after it is created. Most importantly, however, a living trust is useless unless it is funded. A living trust only can control those assets that have been placed into it. If your assets have not been transferred or if you die without funding the trust, the trust will be of no benefit as your estate will still be subject to probate and there may be significant estate tax issues.
Will vs. Living Trust Considerations
There are many positive reasons to establish a trust but do not overlook the fact that it will involve more upfront effort and expense. To determine if you should make the extra effort and invest in the expense of a trust, answer these questions:
Is informal probate an available option? Most states have an expedited or simplified form of probate for estates under a certain dollar threshold (that dollar value varies by state). If your estate could pass under an expedited form of probate, or if you live in a state where probate is not a complex or burdensome process, a will could be appropriate.
Do you have minor children? A trust allows you to establish provisions specifying when a child will be entitled to any assets held in trust.
Do you have children, grandchildren, or other dependents with special needs? In those instances the access or control those heirs have over their inherited property may need to be limited. With a standard will your property can be passed on to those heirs but a will alone does not allow you to exercise much control over their use of the property.
Will your estate be subject to estate taxes? If the value of your estate exceeds the current estate tax threshold, you may wish to consider setting up a trust with tax planning provisions. The estate tax threshold frequently changes, so be sure to check with the IRS to determine whether or not estate tax is a concern for you.
Will you actively manage your estate plan? If not, a living trust may not be a suitable solution. Again, a trust will only be beneficial if assets are transferred into it.
So what is best for you? In many respects, a living trust and a will accomplish similar objectives. A trust, however, allows you to realize other objectives that a will cannot. But those advantages don't come without a price. Whether or not a living trust is better for you than a will depends on whether the additional advantages are worth the cost. When choosing, remember that one size does not fit all. What is right for one person may not be right for everyone. Your estate plan should be prepared in a way that best meets the needs of you and your family.
This article does not address all the intricacies associated with last wills and living trusts. Consulting with a competent attorney can help you make the right decision.

As you're completing our self-guided questionnaire, an attorney is available to answer questions along the way. Once you're done, we'll handle the legal forms and send them to you with instructions on what you need to do to finalize it.





When it's done and beyond
After we've conducted our Peace of Mind ReviewTM and you download and sign your documents, an attorney is available to you for a year to make updates and answer any other legal questions.








Your Estate Plan comes with a Last Will and Testament OR a Living Trust.

Usually, people start the process when major life changes occur, like:




Loss of loved ones
As much as we don't want to think about it, everyone experiences the painful loss of loved ones. It's important to plan for the unexpected to lessen the stress during these unfortunate times.





Marriage
You've probably talked about who gets what and who would be in charge, but it's good to get it in writing so you both know there would be a plan if something unexpected happened.





Kids
More additions to the family, more people to consider. An Estate Plan allows you to plan for your children's future and choose their legal guardians.





Home
Anything you own can be included, but it's usually the big things that come to mind first. You can leave your property or anything else to family and loved ones with an Estate Plan.










Despite its name, Estate Plans aren't just for people with mansions. Here's a simple breakdown:








Last Will & Testament OR Living Trust
You pick one. A Last Will & Testament is where you specify what you want to happen when you're no longer here. A Living Trust allows you to state who receives your things when you pass away, but transfers them to a trust while you're still alive.



Power of Attorney
This allows you to put someone in charge of handling financial and legal matters for you if you're unable to do so (e.g. you're in the hospital and cannot speak for yourself).



Living Will (Advance Healthcare Directive)
This allows you to put someone in charge of making life or death decisions for you if can't (e.g. you don't want to stay on life support if you have a terminal condition, but cannot communicate that yourself).



1 year of attorney advice
This gives you the guidance you need during and after the creation of your Estate Plan. An independent attorney is there to help you update it and answer questions for legal matters such as marriage, personal injury, bankruptcy, home sales, employment agreements, and much more.

Common Questions

How do I know if I need a will or a trust?
This is one of the most common questions that comes up when planning your estate. They accomplish many of the same things, but a Last Will often has to go through the probate process, while a fully funded living trust avoids probate.  But a last will is easy to create, while transferring your assets into a trust can be time consuming and require additional paperwork. However, we know that this simplified explanation is often not enough to help make this difficult decision. It's for that reason that our Estate Plan Bundle comes with a full year of our Personal Legal Plan. You can purchase the bundle, and immediately schedule a consultation with an attorney in your state to help you make this decision. Many people have to decide based on their unique personal factors (state laws, family situation, size of estate etc...), and the help of an attorney is invaluable to fully explore those details.


Do I need to speak with an attorney before starting my documents?
No, but we highly recommend it. Based on your needs, where you live and the value of your assets, a Living Trust may be more appropriate than a Last Will. An attorney who knows the laws of your state is in the best position to provide that guidance. We encourage you to make that determination before starting the Last Will questionnaire.


What if I need to make changes to my documents?
When life changes come up, many people do choose to update their Estate Planning documents, and we make that easy. One key benefit of the Estate Plan Bundle is that it comes with one full year of our Personal Legal Plan. And along with getting advice from attorneys, your membership allows you to revise your documents as often as you need to at no additional cost. 


Are LegalZoom Last Wills and Living Trusts state-specific?
Yes. Our team of experienced attorneys have designed these documents to meet the specific laws and requirements of each U.S. state.


What happens after I order my bundle?
Once you order your bundle, you decide how to start building your Estate Plan. If you have the information you need, you can jump right in and begin filling out our simple online questionnaires. If you have legal questions, you can schedule a consultation with an independent attorney in your state for help. If you have questions about our questionnaire or other technical questions, you can contact our customer care team. Once all of your questions are answered and you've submitted your questionnaires to us, we'll review your work and create your documents, sending them to you in the mail. When they arrive, make sure you're happy with them, and then follow our simple instructions for signing. Once signed, they're done! All that's left is to keep them someplace safe, and know that you can always come back to us if you need to make changes in the future.
