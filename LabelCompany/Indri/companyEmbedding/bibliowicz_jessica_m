But yesterday, he was watching the shares of tiny National Financial Partners, a $413 million revenue financial services firm run by his daughter, Jessica M. Bibliowicz.In its first day of trading, National Financial's shares rose more than $3, to close at $26.25 a share. That was better than the debut of her father's company, then known as Commercial Credit, which rose just an eighth of a point above its offering price on its first day of trading in 1986, Mr. Weill said yesterday.''A little father-daughter competition never hurt anybody,'' Ms. Bibliowicz said. ''It certainly was a good day today.''Mr. Weill was on hand at the New York Stock Exchange with his daughter as she rang the opening bell on a day when, despite some well-publicized turmoil at the top of the exchange, stocks traded as they usually do and even managed to rise.

''I'm absolutely the proud father,'' he said.Ms. Bibliowicz, 43, joined National Financial in 1999, two years after she resigned as mutual funds chief at the Smith Barney unit of Travelers, a predecessor of Citigroup. National Financial is a network of more than 1,300 professionals selling products and services to wealthy individuals and small businesses. The business Ms. Bibliowicz runs, like her father's company, owes much of its growth to acquisitions, buying small financial services firms. Continue reading the main story

National Financial has gone from a $10.5 million loss the year Ms. Bibliowicz joined the company to net income of nearly $13 million for the 12 months ended in June.National Financial's successful stock debut comes at a time when the market for initial public offerings is beginning to recover from a long slump. There have been just 21 public offerings so far this year, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks such offerings. That compares with 50 for all of last year and 406 back in 2000.

''Their timing is good,'' said Kathleen Smith, a portfolio manager of the IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund, managed by Renaissance. Nearly half of the companies that have gone public this year have been financial services companies. These businesses are usually among the first to benefit when the economy starts to recover, she said.Ms. Smith, whose fund bought shares in National Financial's initial offering, was also impressed by Ms. Bibliowicz. ''Not only does she have connections through her dad, she also has the industry expertise,'' she said.At a marketing meeting for the stock offering, Ms. Bibliowicz described the company's ''preferred relationship'' selling the offerings of Travelers Life, a division of Citigroup.But Mr. Weill pointed out that Citigroup did not take National Financial public. ''She got a couple of small firms like Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch,'' which handled the share sale along with J. P. Morgan, he said.Ms. Bibliowicz has a long way to go before her shares are worth as much as her father's $1 billion-plus stake in Citigroup. Based on yesterday's close, her 1.4 percent stake in National Financial was worth close to $12 million.Ms. Bibliowicz did not sell any shares in the public offering.

Why we need precision medicine—now


    By Jessica M. Bibliowicz - 09/01/16 01:00 PM EDT

The launch of President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative is putting a cutting-edge approach to research and patient care on the map.  Academic medical centers have been pioneering the development of precision medicine for more than a decade—and now it’s time for the biopharmaceutical industry to get deeper in the game.The goal of precision medicine is simple: to offer individual patients exactly the right medical care at the right time, by taking their genes, lifestyle, and environment into account.  However, making that vision a reality will require a significant investment of brainpower, technology, and capital.ADVERTISEMENTThe federal government thinks it can be done.  The President’s Precision Medicine Initiative was created to the tune of $200 million in fiscal year 2016—a timely vote of confidence that comes on the heels of twelve years of declining government funding for medical research.  Soon a million or more volunteers will be recruited to join a massive national cohort and share their genetic and health data with researchers at academic medical centers and community health organizations.  Information gleaned from this unprecedented study has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat conditions ranging from diabetes to schizophrenia.At Weill Cornell Medicine, where I serve as chairman of the board, initial efforts have focused on people with cancer.  Patients with advanced disease, who have often run out of other options, come in for DNA sequencing at the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine.  This extra layer of information has prompted doctors to try drugs and combinations that might not have been considered before: an individual with bladder cancer receives a breast cancer drug because of her genetic makeup, for example.  Increasingly, patients are able to beat the odds and live longer, fuller lives, but there are still hurdles to be overcome. Institute director Dr. Mark Rubin and Dr. Himisha Beltran, who leads clinical activities, studied a group of 97 patients and found that more than ninety percent had genetic mutations that could potentially be treated with existing or experimental drugs.  However, only five percent could actually access the medications that were recommended.  The others were unable to enroll in the appropriate clinical trial or to use approved drugs in off-label ways.That’s where the biopharmaceutical industry can really step in.  “Universities excel at identifying biological targets for new drugs and at pinpointing the patients who are more likely to respond to specific treatments.  Industry excels at making drugs and can partner with academia to help implement large-scale clinical trials to test them,” explained Dr. Beltran.  “To get more patients to benefit from precision medicine, we need to work together so that promising drugs end up in the right hands and clinical trials are enrolling the right subsets of people.”Universities and drug companies have a long history of collaborating to develop medicines that have saved and improved the lives of countless individuals.  According to Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health—the country’s biggest source of funding for medical research—these alliances are key to introducing new therapies at a faster pace.“Medical advances that benefit the public generally arise from NIH-funded biomedical research only if actual products are developed and brought to market—and partnerships with the private sector are essential for this translation to succeed,” Collins wrote in a commentary.All signs indicate that precision is the future of medicine.  According to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, thirteen percent of drugs on the market in 2015 had information about genetic markers on the label, up from ten percent just five years earlier.  Leading biotech and pharmaceutical companies predict that their investment in individually tailored therapies will increase by one-third over the coming five years.That gives us reason to hope.  As President Obama’s term draws to a close, perhaps his greatest legacy will be in healthcare and the visionary initiatives he has advanced in this arena.  Hope defined his first campaign for president—and remains a fitting touch point for everyone who has ever been affected by disease.“Precision medicine is all about patients,” Dr. Rubin said.  “Working together with government, with industry, and with the community, academic medical centers are looking for better ways to care for individuals—really just you and me—when we get sick.”Jessica M. Bibliowicz is the chairman of the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medicine and a senior advisor of Bridge Growth Partners.The views expressed by authors are their own and not the views of The Hill.
