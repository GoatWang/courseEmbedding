If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you. After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online, such as yellowpages.com. You can check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.Why should I hire a lawyer?If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, or you need help to navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. Also, during times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you might need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available.What can I have an attorney do for me?When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.

You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship.
The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.
You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Ask as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle.
How much will an attorney cost?You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant. Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Can I ask an attorney about past cases they worked on?You can ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases. You should check their office for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You can also ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.What does a family lawyer do?Family attorneys deal with personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork, such as adoption or inheritance documents.What does a divorce attorney do?Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.What does a personal injury lawyer do?When you're hurt by an outside party, and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.What does a civil attorney do?If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.What does a bankruptcy lawyer do?A bankruptcy lawyer can help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.See more Tips & AdviceSponsoredSarles Frey & Joseph5800 Main St, Buffalo, NY 14221(716) 626-5200WebsiteServices OfferedDirectionsMore InfoTVC Pro DriverServing the Buffalo area.(877) 623-3533WebsiteMore InfoA TRAFFIC TICKET ATTORNEYS CALIFORNIA & NATIONWIDE(36)Serving the Buffalo area.(877) 787-2334Commercial - Taxi - DUI - Or ANY Driver, California & NationwideWebsiteMore InfoLegalFoxServing the Buffalo area.(888) 981-8587Find a Local AttorneyWebsiteMore Info24/7 LegalServing the Buffalo area.(888) 659-7710WebsiteContact UsMore InfoLegal Aid Legal Services Corp.Serving the Buffalo area.(888) 877-7150WebsiteMore InfoCommunity Legal SolutionsServing the Buffalo area.(888) 280-0993We can help!

Some may remember me with the firm of Nicholas, Perot, where I also practiced personal injury from 1991-1998.I have settled millions of dollars worth of negligence/insurance claims for clients ranging from auto accidents to dog bites to just about any type of personal injury..My advertising is mostly word of mouth, and I take pride in the fact that I am accessible, straightforward, and I am told, a great listener and easy to confide in..and "I do not hide behind my secretary", meaning that it is my priority to promptly take and return calls. I can be reached 24/7 at 842-6033 or 491-2049 (716), and I consider my hundreds of injured clients and their concerned families over my lengthy career to be confidential friends as much as confidential clients.And most importantly, each case is as unique as the next and I NEVER take a client for granted: Hence my motto, " A Career of Hundreds of Clients One at a Time."  Any past clients or new clients feel free to call day or night to arrange for a free consultation or to just keep in touch, and always feel free to have someone you know call me to privately talk about any type of legal issue which is of concern to them or you..and make it my concern as well.Sargent & CollinsAlex N. ratedMy experience with Sargent & Collins was positive. They represented me three times in real estate transactions for the past five years. The initial contact with Nicholas Sargent was always brief: I briefly explain my need to the secretary, Nicholas returns my call in the same business day, we speak about property and the contract and he gives me a quote. The rest of the interaction typically goes through one of the paralegals. I like that I can call, or email, or PDF, or fax. I think, overall they represented me in a professional manner, were flexible where it was necessary, and charged a very reasonable amount for the service. Prior to working with Sargent & Collins I hired a lawyer who bitterly disappointed me: on my request to process contract as fast as possible, he quietly left for 1 month vacation, required me to attend city clerk's office to pay and process documentation, and charged me almost twice as much. After that experience, working with Sargent & Collins brought a much needed relief. Can I recommend Sargent & Collins? I believe -- Yes. Lawyers are not your friends, but as long as your request is legitimate and you act professionally, I believe Sargent & Collins will treat you right. Randy S. Margulis, Esq. Attorney At Lawjayshearer ratedHe is such a personable lawyer...He is such a personable lawyer. I had a situation concerning custody and needed to be represented. I had a public defender before him and the guy was hopeless. I retained Randy and he ensured my needs and intentions were fulfilled. He returned every phone call and kept me constantly up to speed on everything was going on in my case. He brings his 'A Game' so to speak to EVERY court hearing. He is an extremely aggressive lawyer who will work hard on your case to get you the results you need. In my court case he left no stone unturned. He is also really honest, fair, and a decent human being who also has the ability to level with you. Don't hesitate to retain him. I recommend him highly. Randy S. Margulis, Esq. Attorney At LawDavid B. ratedVery professional and extremely knowledgeable. I have 0 complaints and recommend Randy's Lawfirm to anyone. I have read the review below from Tammy O. And had a very different experience with Nicole. In my experience If Nicole was unavailable she returned my calls and emails in a timely manner.. Even when she was on vacation and I didnt want to interupt her but needed her, she was there responding to texts and emails. I wish there were more stars to give up unfortunately there is only 5 to give. I never had to hire a lawyer before, after meeting with Randy my intuition told me   he was the best for the job and he is.Fromen John J Attykantinually ratedDirected to the post previous ...Directed to the post previous .. You must have been a victim of his intelligence, I was recommended Mr. Fromen by two Lancaster cops and not only did he far out exceed all of wishes he referenced me to John Bear CEO of Forge Consulting where I got 7% tax free on my reward. Mr. Fromen doesn't advertise because he doesn't need to, look up who the wealthiest people in western NY are. Again, to the person who previously stated that non-sense about Mr. Fromen, you're a LOSER ! Mr. Fromen is the reason why my life is as great as it is. James D Eiss AttyJoy B. ratedJim Eiss provided my husband and myself with excellent service in moving from Canada to the US.  Technically he is excellent and the paperwork is done flawlessly.  More importantly, he understands that he is in a service business;  every phone call I made to his office resulted in my promptly talking with him.  Most importantly, he understands that immigrating is an emotional process and calmly answers questions.  I am not a person who is prone to superlatives; nevertheless, I rate Jim Eiss with the highest of scores.Lorenzo & Cohensangeez2005 ratedSteve Cohen and his staffI personally dealt with Steve and his staff IF any wants the best of the best then I would hire his law firm he is the , He keep you informed of every part of the case , He takes his time to listen to his clients and makes you feel secure and not LOST like most other lawyers do.

Thanks James!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
