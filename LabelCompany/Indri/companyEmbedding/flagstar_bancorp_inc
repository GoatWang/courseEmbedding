History[edit]
Flagstar was founded as a federal savings bank in 1987 under the name First Security Savings Bank. The bank's chairman was Thomas J. Hammond. The initial branch focused on funding regional retail and wholesale mortgage operations.[1] In 1993, FSSB Holding Corporation was established. Security Savings Bank, based in Jackson, Michigan, was purchased in 1994. The company changed its name to Flagstar Bank in 1996.[1] Flagstar Bancorp went public in 1997.[2] In 2001, it moved its stock listing from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[3] By 2009, the bank had 179 branches.[4] Flagstar was affected by the housing-led recession of 2007, and the bank recorded losses from 2008 until the second quarter of 2012.[4] The company raised $1.6 billion in new capital with investments from MP Thrift Investments L.P., the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and public offerings.[5] Flagstar effected 1:10 reverse stock splits in 2010 and 2012 to maintain its New York Stock Exchange listing.[4] The U.S. Department of Treasury sold its preferred stock of Flagstar to private investors in 2013.[6]
Flagstar reached settlements in several cases to move past the legacy issues that arose through its mortgage operations. In May 2013, Flagstar paid a $110 million settlement to MBIA.[7][8] In June 2013, Flagstar reached a $105-million settlement with Assured Guaranty.[9] Flagstar paid a $93.5-million settlement to Fannie Mae in November 2011,[10][11] and $8.9 million to Freddie Mac in December 2013.[12] In September 2014, Flagstar agreed to pay $37.5 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[13]
In August 2016, it was announced that Flagstar had repaid all of the funds it received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[14]
Operations[edit]
Flagstar ranked number 13 on Inside Mortgage Finance's list of Top 50 Mortgage Lenders in 2016.[15] Flagstar Bank services and sub-services loans on a fee basis for others, and services residential mortgages held-for-investment in their own portfolio. In 2016, Flagstar was given the Servicer Total Achievement and Rewards (STAR Award) from Fannie Mae in the General Servicing category.[16]
Community[edit]
In September 2016, Flagstar Bank announced its plans for a $10 million economic development program for Pontiac, Michigan. The five-year initiative is aimed at helping revitalize the Oakland County, MI city. The program includes $5 million for home mortgages including a customized home loan product for Pontiac residents, $2.5 million for small businesses and start-ups, $1.5 million for the previously announced naming rights of the Flagstar Strand Theatre for the Performing Arts along with an investment of $1 million for financial literacy in the community.[17]
Management[edit]
Thomas J. Hammond, founder of Flagstar, served as chairman of Flagstar Bank and Flagstar Bancorp. Mark Hammond became president of the bank in 1995 and CEO in 2002. In 2009, former CEO of Sovereign Bancorp Joseph P. Campanelli was named chairman, president, and CEO of Flagstar Bank and Flagstar Bancorp.[3][18] In 2012, Michael J. Tierney, previously executive vice president and managing director of personal financial services at Flagstar, became president and CEO of the organizations.[19] At that time, former vice chairman and director of Comerica Bank and Comerica Incorporated, John D. Lewis was named chairman and director of the organizations.[20] Alessandro P. DiNello became president, CEO and director of the organizations in 2013.[21]

Controversy[edit]
On February 24, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Flagstar, alleging that it had been improperly approving thousands of residential home mortgage loans for government insurance. On March 13, 2012 it was announced that shareholder rights firm Robbins Umeda LLP was investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of the law by certain officers and directors at Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Flagstar was founded as a federal savings bank in 1987 under the name First Security Savings Bank. The bank's chairman was Thomas J. Hammond. The initial branch focused on funding regional retail and wholesale mortgage operations.[1] In 1993, FSSB Holding Corporation was established. Security Savings Bank, based in Jackson, Michigan, was purchased in 1994. The company changed its name to Flagstar Bank in 1996.[1] Flagstar Bancorp went public in 1997.[2] In 2001, it moved its stock listing from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[3] By 2009, the bank had 179 branches.[4] Flagstar was affected by the housing-led recession of 2007, and the bank recorded losses from 2008 until the second quarter of 2012.[4] The company raised $1.6 billion in new capital with investments from MP Thrift Investments L.P., the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and public offerings.[5] Flagstar effected 1:10 reverse stock splits in 2010 and 2012 to maintain its New York Stock Exchange listing.[4] The U.S. Department of Treasury sold its preferred stock of Flagstar to private investors in 2013.[6]
Flagstar reached settlements in several cases to move past the legacy issues that arose through its mortgage operations. In May 2013, Flagstar paid a $110 million settlement to MBIA.[7][8] In June 2013, Flagstar reached a $105-million settlement with Assured Guaranty.[9] Flagstar paid a $93.5-million settlement to Fannie Mae in November 2011,[10][11] and $8.9 million to Freddie Mac in December 2013.[12] In September 2014, Flagstar agreed to pay $37.5 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[13]
In August 2016, it was announced that Flagstar had repaid all of the funds it received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[14]
Operations[edit]
Flagstar ranked number 13 on Inside Mortgage Finance's list of Top 50 Mortgage Lenders in 2016.[15] Flagstar Bank services and sub-services loans on a fee basis for others, and services residential mortgages held-for-investment in their own portfolio. In 2016, Flagstar was given the Servicer Total Achievement and Rewards (STAR Award) from Fannie Mae in the General Servicing category.[16]
Community[edit]
In September 2016, Flagstar Bank announced its plans for a $10 million economic development program for Pontiac, Michigan. The five-year initiative is aimed at helping revitalize the Oakland County, MI city. The program includes $5 million for home mortgages including a customized home loan product for Pontiac residents, $2.5 million for small businesses and start-ups, $1.5 million for the previously announced naming rights of the Flagstar Strand Theatre for the Performing Arts along with an investment of $1 million for financial literacy in the community.[17]
Management[edit]
Thomas J. Hammond, founder of Flagstar, served as chairman of Flagstar Bank and Flagstar Bancorp. Mark Hammond became president of the bank in 1995 and CEO in 2002. In 2009, former CEO of Sovereign Bancorp Joseph P. Campanelli was named chairman, president, and CEO of Flagstar Bank and Flagstar Bancorp.[3][18] In 2012, Michael J. Tierney, previously executive vice president and managing director of personal financial services at Flagstar, became president and CEO of the organizations.[19] At that time, former vice chairman and director of Comerica Bank and Comerica Incorporated, John D. Lewis was named chairman and director of the organizations.[20] Alessandro P. DiNello became president, CEO and director of the organizations in 2013.[21]

TROY, Mich., Feb. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:    FBC) announced today the signing of a definitive agreement under which it will acquire the Residential Mortgage Delegated Correspondent Lending platform of Stearns Lending, LLC, (Stearns) along with certain related assets. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close within the next 30 days.








Stearns' business consists of approximately 250 correspondent relationships accounting for over $7 billion of agency and governmental residential mortgage loan production annually. Stearns' employees and subcontractors associated with the delegated business will transition to Flagstar. 
"The acquisition of Stearns' correspondent platform gives us a tremendous opportunity to expand our market share in the delegated space," remarked Alessandro P. DiNello, Flagstar's president and chief executive officer. "Throughout our analysis of the business, we have been impressed with the Stearns' team's approach to the correspondent channel, their focus on customer service and their commitment to sound risk management. We believe this team will be a strong cultural fit with the Flagstar team.
"We are excited to add the high-quality team from Stearns. We believe that there is a continued opportunity to grow our market share and expand our relationship with these correspondents. Being a bank, we can offer these new customers additional products and services, deepening our relationships with them," observed DiNello.
Stearns' chief executive officer, Brian Hale, commented, "When we decided to exit this business for strategic reasons, we had two key objectives: first, we wanted to ensure that our network of correspondent lenders – consisting of community banks, credit unions and builder-owned mortgage companies – was with a lender that would continue to serve them well. Equally important, we wanted to make sure that our employees were with a reputable, well-run organization. Flagstar certainly met both our criteria."
Upon closing, the acquisition will make Flagstar the 4th largest correspondent mortgage loan originator in the United States, based on year-to-date volumes through September 30, 2016 as reported by Inside Mortgage Finance. Wells Fargo Securities served as financial advisor to Stearns and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP served as its legal counsel. BuckleySandler LLP served as legal counsel to Flagstar.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
