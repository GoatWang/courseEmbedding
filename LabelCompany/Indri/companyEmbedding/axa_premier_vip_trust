Item 24.
Persons controlled by or under Common Control with Registrant  AXA Equitable controls the Trust by virtue of its ownership of more than 95% of the Trusts shares as of March 31, 2009. All shareholders of the Trust are required to solicit instructions from their
respective contract owners as to certain matters. The Trust may also offer its shares to insurance companies unaffiliated with AXA Equitable, to other series of the Trust and to series of EQ Advisors Trust, a separate registered investment company
managed by AXA Equitable.  On July 22, 1992, AXA Equitable converted from a New York mutual life insurance company to a
publicly-owned New York stock life insurance company. At that time AXA Equitable became a wholly-owned subsidiary of AXA Financial, Inc. (AXA Financial). AXA Financial continues to own 100% of AXA Equitables common stock.
 AXA is the largest shareholder of AXA Financial. AXA owns, directly or indirectly through its affiliates, 100% of the outstanding common
stock of AXA Financial. AXA is the holding company for an international group of insurance and related financial services companies. AXAs insurance operations include activities in life insurance, property and casualty insurance and
reinsurance. The insurance operations are diverse geographically, with activities principally in Western Europe, North America, and the Asia/Pacific area and, to a lesser extent, in Africa and South America. AXA is also engaged in asset management,
investing banking, securities trading, brokerage, real estate and other financial services activities principally in the United States, as well as in Western Europe and the Asia/Pacific area.   


Item 25.
Indemnification  Article VIII of the Agreement and Declaration
of Trust of the Registrant states:  Section 1. Limitation of Liability. A Trustee, when acting in such
capacity, shall not be personally liable to any Person, other than the Trust or a Shareholder to the extent provided in this Article VIII, for any act, omission or obligation of the Trust, of such Trustee or of any other Trustee; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein or in the Delaware Act shall protect any Trustee against any liability to the Trust or to any Shareholder to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the office of the Trustee hereunder.  All persons extending credit to,
contracting with or having any claim against the Trust or a particular Series shall look only to the assets of the Trust or such Series for payment under such contract or claim; and neither the Trustees nor any of the Trusts officers,
employees or agents, whether past, present or future, shall be personally liable therefor. Provided they have exercised reasonable care and have acted under the reasonable belief that their actions are in the best interest of the Trust, the Trustees
and officers of the Trust shall not be responsible or liable for any act or omission or for neglect or wrongdoing of them or any officer, agent, employee, Manager, or Principal Underwriter of the Trust, but nothing contained in this Declaration of
Trust or in the Delaware Act shall protect any Trustee or officer of the Trust against liability to the Trust or to Shareholders to which he or she would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office.  Every note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate
or undertaking and every other act or thing 




whatsoever executed or done by or on behalf of the Trust or the Trustees by any of them in connection with the Trust shall conclusively be deemed to have
been executed or done only in or with respect to his or their capacity as Trustee or Trustees, and such Trustee or Trustees shall not be personally liable thereon.  Section 2. Indemnification of Covered Persons. Every Covered Person shall be indemnified by the Trust to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware Act and other applicable law.  Section 3. Indemnification of Shareholder. If any
Shareholder or former Shareholder of any Series shall be held personally liable solely by reason of his or her being or having been a Shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or former
Shareholder (or his or her heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives or in the case of any entity, its general successor) shall be entitled out of the assets belonging to the applicable Series to be held harmless from and
indemnified against all loss and expense arising from such liability. The Trust, on behalf of the affected Series, shall, upon request by such Shareholder, assume the defense of any claim made against such Shareholder for any act or obligation of
the Series and satisfy any judgment thereon from the assets of the Series.  Article IX of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the
Registrant states:  Section 5. Amendments. Except as specifically provided in this Section 5, the
Trustees may, without Shareholder vote, restate, amend, or otherwise supplement this Declaration of Trust. Shareholders shall have the right to vote on (i) any amendment that would affect their right to vote granted in Article V, Section 1
hereof, (ii) any amendment to this Section 5, (iii) any amendment that may require their vote under applicable law or by the Trusts registration statement, as filed with the Commission, and (iv) any amendment submitted to
them for their vote by the Trustees. Any amendment required or permitted to be submitted to the Shareholders that, as the Trustees determine, shall affect the Shareholders of one or more Series shall be authorized by a vote of the Shareholders of
each Series affected and no vote of Shareholders of a Series not affected shall be required. Notwithstanding anything else herein, no amendment hereof shall limit the rights to insurance with respect to any acts or omissions of Persons covered
thereby prior to such amendment nor shall any such amendment limit the rights to indemnification referenced in Article VIII, Section 2 hereof as provided in the By-Laws with respect to any actions or omissions of Persons covered thereby prior
to such amendment. The Trustees may, without shareholder vote, restate, amend, or otherwise supplement the Certificate of Trust as they deem necessary or desirable.  Article X of the By-Laws of the Registrant states:  Section 3. Advance
Payment of Indemnifiable Expenses. Expenses incurred by an agent in connection with the preparation and presentation of a defense to any proceeding may be paid by the Trust from time to time prior to final disposition thereof upon receipt of an
undertaking by, or on behalf of, such agent that such amount will be paid over by him or her to the Trust if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification; provided, however, that (a) such agent shall have
provided appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust is insured against losses arising out of any such advance payments, or (c) either a majority of the Trustees who are neither Interested Persons of the Trust nor parties to
the proceeding, or independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined, based upon a review of the readily available facts (as opposed to a trial-type inquiry or full investigation), that there is reason to believe that such agent
will be found entitled to indemnification. 


Section 2. D. of the Registrants Investment Management Agreement and Section 2. E of
the Registrants Investment Management Agreement with respect to the AXA Allocation Portfolios and Target Allocation Portfolios each state:  Limitations on Liability. Manager will exercise its best judgment in rendering its services to the Trust, and the Trust agrees, as an inducement to Managers undertaking to do so, that the Manager will not
be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Trust in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, but will be liable only for willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of its duties or obligations in rendering its services to the Trust as specified in this Agreement. Any person, even though an officer, director, employee or agent of Manager, who may be or become an officer, Trustee, employee or agent of
the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or when acting on any business of the Trust, to be rendering such services to or to be acting solely for the Trust and not as an officer, director, employee or agent, or one under the
control or direction of Manager, even though paid by it.  Sections 5. A. and 5. B. of each of the Registrants Investment Advisory
Agreements state:  Liability and Indemnification. A. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Investment Company Act
or any other federal securities law, neither the Adviser nor any of its officers, directors, members or employees (its Affiliates) shall be liable for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation (including legal and other
expenses) incurred or suffered by the Manager or the Trust as a result of any error of judgment or mistake of law by the Adviser or its Affiliates with respect to the Fund, except that nothing in this Agreement shall operate or purport to operate in
any way to exculpate, waive or limit the liability of the Adviser or its Affiliates for, and the Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Manager, all affiliated persons thereof (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the
Investment Company Act) and all controlling persons (as described in Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act)) (collectively, Manager Indemnitees) against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or litigation (including reasonable legal and other expenses) to which any of the Manager Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933 Act, the Investment Company Act, the Advisers Act, or under any other statute, at common law or
otherwise arising out of or based on (i) any willful misconduct, bad faith, reckless disregard or gross negligence of the Adviser in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder or (ii) any untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the Prospectus and SAI, proxy materials, reports, advertisements, sales literature, or other materials pertaining to the Allocated Portion or the omission to state therein a material fact known to the Adviser which was required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished by the Adviser to the Manager or the Trust by the Adviser Indemnitees (as defined below) for
use therein.  B. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Investment Company Act or any other federal securities law, the
Manager and the Trust shall not be liable for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation (including legal and other expenses) incurred or suffered by the Adviser as a result of any error of judgment or mistake of law by the Manager with
respect to the Allocated Portion, except that nothing in this Agreement shall operate or purport to operate in any way to exculpate, waive or limit the liability of the Manager for, and the Manager shall indemnify and hold harmless the Adviser, all
affiliated persons thereof (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act) and all controlling persons (as described in Section 15 of the 1933 Act) (collectively, Adviser Indemnitees) against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation (including reasonable legal and other expenses) to which any of the Adviser Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933 Act, the Investment Company Act, the Advisers Act, or under any other
statute, at common law or otherwise arising out of or based on (i) any willful misconduct, bad faith, reckless disregard or gross negligence of the Manager in the performance of any of its duties or 




obligations hereunder or (ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus and SAI, proxy materials, reports, advertisements,
sales literature, or other materials pertaining to the Fund or the omission to state therein a material fact known to the Manager that was required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such
statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished to the Manager or the Trust.  Section 14 of each of the
Registrants Distribution Agreements states:  The Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor from any
and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which the Distributor may be subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or result from negligent,
improper, fraudulent or unauthorized acts or omissions by the Trust or its officers, trustees, agents or representatives, other than acts or omissions caused directly or indirectly by the Distributor.  The Distributor will indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, its officers, trustees, agents and representatives against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, to which the Trust, its officers, trustees, agents and representatives may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Trust Prospectus and/or SAI or any supplements thereto; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state any material fact required to be stated in the Trust
Prospectus and/or SAI or any supplements thereto or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (iii) other misconduct or negligence of the Distributor in its capacity as a principal underwriter of the Trusts shares and
will reimburse the Trust, its officers, trustees, agents and representatives for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the Distributor shall not be liable in any such instance to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in the Trust Prospectus and/or SAI or any supplement in good faith reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the Preparing Parties specifically for use in the preparation of the Trust Prospectus and/or SAI.
 Number 6 of the Registrants Mutual Funds Service Agreement states:  Limitation of Liability and Indemnification. (a) AXA Equitable shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for
any loss or expense suffered by the Trust, in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except for a loss or expense caused by or resulting from or attributable to willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence on AXA
Equitables part (or on the part of any third party to whom AXA Equitable has delegated any of its duties and obligations pursuant to Section 4(c) hereunder) in the performance of its (or such third partys) duties or from reckless
disregard by AXA Equitable (or by such third party) of its obligations and duties under this Agreement (in the case of AXA Equitable) or under an agreement with AXA Equitable (in the case of such third party) or, subject to Section 10 below,
AXA Equitables (or such third partys) refusal or failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement (in the case of AXA Equitable) or an agreement with AXA Equitable (in the case of such third party) or its breach of any representation
or warranty under this Agreement (in the case of AXA Equitable) or under an agreement with AXA Equitable (in the case of such third party). In no event shall AXA Equitable (or such third party) be liable for any indirect, incidental special or
consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if AXA Equitable (or such third party) has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the action. 


(b) Except to the extent that AXA Equitable may be held liable pursuant to
Section 6(a) above, AXA Equitable shall not be responsible for, and the Trust shall indemnify and hold AXA Equitable harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, costs, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, payments, expenses
and liabilities, including but not limited to those arising out of or attributable to:  (i) any and all actions of AXA
Equitable or its officers or agents required to be taken pursuant to this Agreement;  (ii) the reliance on or use by AXA
Equitable or its officers or agents of information, records, or documents which are received by AXA Equitable or its officers or agents and furnished to it or them by or on behalf of the Trust, and which have been prepared or maintained by the Trust
or any third party on behalf of the Trust;  (iii) the Trusts refusal or failure to comply with the terms of this
Agreement or the Trusts lack of good faith, or its actions, or lack thereof, involving negligence or willful misfeasance;  (iv) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Trust hereunder;  (v) the reliance on or the carrying out
by AXA Equitable or its officers or agents of any proper instructions reasonably believed to be duly authorized, or requests of the Trust;  (vi) any delays, inaccuracies, errors in or omissions from information or data provided to AXA Equitable by data services, including data services providing information in connection with any third party computer
system licensed to AXA Equitable, and by any corporate action services, pricing services or securities brokers and dealers;  (vii) the offer or sale of shares by the Trust in violation of any requirement under the Federal securities laws or regulations or the securities laws or regulations of any state, or in violation of any stop order or other determination or
ruling by any Federal agency or any state agency with respect to the offer or sale of such shares in such state (1) resulting from activities, actions, or omissions by the Trust or its other service providers and agents, or (2) existing or
arising out of activities, actions or omissions by or on behalf of the Trust prior to the effective date of this Agreement;  (viii) any failure of the Trusts registration statement to comply with the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act (including the rules and regulations thereunder) and any other applicable laws, or any untrue statement of a material fact or
omission of a material fact necessary to make any statement therein not misleading in a Trusts prospectus;  (ix)
except as provided for in Schedule B.III., the actions taken by the Trust, its Manager, its investment advisers, and its distributor in compliance with applicable securities, tax, commodities and other laws, rules and regulations, or the failure to
so comply, and  (x) all actions, inactions, omissions, or errors caused by third parties to whom AXA Equitable or the Trust
has assigned any rights and/or delegated any duties under this Agreement at the specific request of or as required by the Trust, its Funds, investment advisers, or Trust distributors. 


The Trust shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential
losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits) even if the Trust has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the action, except when the Trust is required to indemnify AXA
Equitable pursuant to this Agreement.  Number 12(a)(iv) of the Registrants Global Custody Agreement states:  (A) Customer shall indemnify and hold Bank and its directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively the Indemnitees)
harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties, and expenses, including out-of-pocket and incidental expenses and legal fees (Losses) that may be incurred by, or asserted against, the
Indemnitees or any of them for following any instructions or other directions upon which Bank is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. (B) In addition to and not in limitation of the preceding subparagraph, Customer shall
also indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each of them harmless from and against any and all Losses that may be incurred by, or asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them in connection with or arising out of Banks performance under
this Agreement, provided the Indemnitees have not acted with negligence or engaged in willful misconduct. (C) In performing its obligations hereunder, Bank may rely on the genuineness of any document which it reasonably believes in good faith
to have been validly executed.  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be provided to
trustees, officers and controlling persons of the Trust, pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Trust has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Trust of expenses incurred or paid by a trustee, officer or controlling person of the Trust
in connection with the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding or payment pursuant to any insurance policy) is asserted against the Trust by such trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered,
the Trust will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
