Support Questions
 






         How can I get help? 
          




Within the application
Just look for the orange Need Help? tab on the right margin of the screen after you log into your account. 
Contact customer support
Locate your region's support contact details.





         How long will it take to get a confirmation response? 
          




Our average response time for In-Network responders is 48 hours for banks and financial institutions, and approximately 2 weeks for law firms. For Out-of-Network requests, the response time is longer and will increase during peak times. Responders complete confirmations in the order they are received, so if you have a tight deadline, we recommend sending them early. You can send requests in advance of your audit's year end date.





         What is a consolidated confirmation? 
          




You should select the form type based on the product type you are looking to confirm (e.g. asset, liability etc). The Consolidated form type should be used when you want to perform a comprehensive search of the responder's records based on a single account number for an entity. Only one Consolidated request should be submitted per entity per bank (this will cover multiple accounts in one request). Individual confirmations (e.g. asset or liability) should have a separate request for each account.





         I sent a confirmation with errors 
          




If you send a confirmation with an error (for example, the wrong 'As of' Date), you can 'Recall' it if the responder has not yet started work on it. Watch the video above on how to recall a confirmation. If the confirmation cannot be recalled, contact customer support. You must resubmit your confirmation with the correct information. You can do this either before or after you recall the incorrect one.





         My completed confirmation has errors 
          




If you receive a confirmation with errors or omissions, you can 'Re-confirm' this with the responding entity. Re-confirmations are free of charge and are prioritized in front of new requests that the responder receives. View the video on 'Re-confirming a confirmation' at the top of this page.





         How do I update a client authorization? 
          




Changes to client signers must be made at the Client Profile and updated on the Accounts - otherwise, the authorization request cannot be sent to the new signer.





         What's an Engagement Number? 
          




The Engagement Number is your audit firm's internal reference code relating to the audit client used to track time and expenses relating to that client. This is useful for tracking expenses as it will be displayed on certain billing reports.





         What's an Account ID? 
          




Certain forms, such as asset or liability forms, refer to 'Account ID'. This is the unique account identifier or account number relating to the account you want to confirm.





         How do I set up office billing? 
          




There are no license or sign up fees for using Confirmation.com – auditors only pay for confirmations they send. By default, users will be required to pay at the point of initiating a request to a responder. We have office billing arrangements available suitable to firms that want to gain additional efficiencies in processing confirmations. Office billing requires a nominated supervisor to manage the arrangement.

The world's leading provider of online audit confirmations







Our Story
Our Reach
Our Team



Our Story



The concept of electronic audit confirmations all started with Brian Fox, founder of Confirmation.com. Having worked at two of the “Big Four” accounting firms, Brian experienced firsthand how the paper-based process was both inefficient and open to high risk of fraud. In 1999, during his first year at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management, Brian put together a business plan that outlined how the Internet could replace the conventional paper-based confirmation process.








After completing his MBA in 2001, Brian started the company to improve the audit confirmation process for the banking and accounting professions. During the company's early years, the management team was assembled under the leadership of Chris Schellhorn, former President and CEO of Visa Interactive and Managing Director of Integrion, Inc. Early activities included development and testing of the infrastructure for the first secure online confirmation clearinghouse. In 2003, after a few high-profile fraud cases put a spotlight on the inherent weaknesses of the paper-based process, banks and the accounting profession realized more had to be done to prevent confirmation fraud.
As the accounting industry standards evolved to address confirmation fraud-related issues and electronic confirmations, Confirmation.com was there with leadership, expertise, and a powerful solution. Today, Confirmation.com is the most trusted name for secure online audit confirmations worldwide.
Continuing with the mission of ending financial statement fraud, Confirmation.com engaged in a joint venture with CPA.com to build to a private company financial statement clearinghouse. The RIVIO clearinghouse gives (private company) key stakeholders like lenders confidence that the financial statements are not altered and coming from their original source, the CPA firm.  To learn more visit, RIVIO.com.





Who We Are
Confirmation.com provides secure online confirmation services for auditors—those responding to confirmation requests and their shared client. Confirmation.com's patented service provides an all-in-one solution that helps minimize fraud and elevate efficiency for the entire audit confirmation process. Confirmation.com's unique Authentication and Authorization process validates the authenticity and authorization of each user.

Our Story



The concept of electronic audit confirmations all started with Brian Fox, founder of Confirmation.com. Having worked at two of the “Big Four” accounting firms, Brian experienced firsthand how the paper-based process was both inefficient and open to high risk of fraud. In 1999, during his first year at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management, Brian put together a business plan that outlined how the Internet could replace the conventional paper-based confirmation process.








After completing his MBA in 2001, Brian started the company to improve the audit confirmation process for the banking and accounting professions. During the company's early years, the management team was assembled under the leadership of Chris Schellhorn, former President and CEO of Visa Interactive and Managing Director of Integrion, Inc. Early activities included development and testing of the infrastructure for the first secure online confirmation clearinghouse. In 2003, after a few high-profile fraud cases put a spotlight on the inherent weaknesses of the paper-based process, banks and the accounting profession realized more had to be done to prevent confirmation fraud.
As the accounting industry standards evolved to address confirmation fraud-related issues and electronic confirmations, Confirmation.com was there with leadership, expertise, and a powerful solution. Today, Confirmation.com is the most trusted name for secure online audit confirmations worldwide.
Continuing with the mission of ending financial statement fraud, Confirmation.com engaged in a joint venture with CPA.com to build to a private company financial statement clearinghouse. The RIVIO clearinghouse gives (private company) key stakeholders like lenders confidence that the financial statements are not altered and coming from their original source, the CPA firm.  To learn more visit, RIVIO.com.
