All of the NCG Committee members are independent (PDF).
One responsibility of the NCG Committee pursuant to the NCG Committee Mandate (PDF) is to identify individuals qualified to become Board members and recommend potential new Board members.
The NCG Committee seeks to ensure the Board has a sufficient range of skills, expertise and experience to allow the Board to carry out its mandate and functions effectively. The NCG Committee receives and evaluates suggestions for candidates from individual directors, the CEO and from professional search organizations.

Encana Corporation produces, transports and markets natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs). It was formed in 2002 and descends from the 19th century Canadian Pacific Railway and 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' in the 20th century, respectively. All of Encana’s reserves and production are located in North America since other international assets were divested in the mid-2000s. The corporate headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta. Encana has onshore operations in Alberta and northeast British Columbia and a development off the coast of Nova Scotia. In the United States, Encana's subsidiary operates in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Texas, and Louisiana. After incorporating in 2006, Encana Corporation formed two subsidiaries in 2009, with Encana operating in "unconventional natural gas and natural gas liquids exploration, processing, and transportation, and an integrated oil company called Cenovus Energy.
In October 2015, Encana announced it would sell its Colorado oil and gas assets for $900 million.[4]

Canadian operations[edit]
Encana is Canada’s largest natural gas producer (Penty 2012-12 China Institute)[5] with a large land position in western Canada of 7.0 million net acres, of which about 3.2 million net acres are undeveloped.[6]
Encana's natural gas resource plays include: Bighorn in west central Alberta, Coalbed Methane, Cutbank Ridge in northern British Columbia, Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Clearwater in southern Alberta, including the emerging Clearwater Oil play, and Greater Sierra in northeast British Columbia. The Duvernay in west central Alberta is an emerging play.[7] The Deep Panuke project produces and processes natural gas from approximately 250 kilometers offshore southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2013.[8]
As of 31 December 2012[update] Bighorn is a 307,000 gross acres (266,000 net acres) resource play in west central Alberta with Resthaven, Kakwa, Redrock and Berland as primary properties. In 2012, Encana drilled approximately 31 net wells and produced about 242,000 barrels per day of natural gas and approximately 5,800 barrels per day of oil and NGLs.[7]
Cutbank Ridge is in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foothills, southwest of Dawson Creek, British Columbia. As of 31 December 2012[update] Encana controlled about 467,000 gross undeveloped acres (240,000 net acres) over the deep basin Montney formation of which 85,000 net acres have been developed since 2006 near Dawson Creek.[7]
At Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Encana drills into the Montney Formation, where it controls about 254,000 gross undeveloped acres (236,000 net acres). As of 31 December 2012[update], about 26 net wells produced 108,000 barrels per day of natural gas and 2,900 barrels per day of oil and NGLs after royalties. Encana is a 60% owner of the Sexsmith plant, which has a total capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, after it sold compression and gathering lines in the Sexsmith and Pipestone areas to an "unrelated third party". At the same time, the Gordondale sour gas deep cut plant started production with a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to yield 1,700 thousand barrels per day after royalties.[7]
US operations[edit]
Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. is the US subsidiary of Encana Corporation and headquartered in Denver. It has interest in approximately 2.6 million net acres of land in the US, of which 2.1 million net acres were undeveloped as of 2012.[6] In December 2011, Encana closed the sale of the majority of its North Texas natural gas producing properties.[9] As of 2012[update] key resource plays included: the Haynesville Shale in southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas, Jonah Field in Wyoming, Wattenberg Gas Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (abbreviated DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.[10] For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. It also has oil interests in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale on the border between Mississippi and Louisiana.
By 2013 Encana (USA) was funding about 30 different plays.[11]
Production and profits[edit]
At year end 2011, the company’s average production was 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and 24,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.[2] It had more than 3500 employees per its April 2011 prospectus.[10] Since 2012 the company's strategy has been to "divest its low-profit generating assets and focus on the lucrative core business of natural gas and liquids production".[12]
On February 25, 2015 Encana cut $700 million from its 2015 budget after reporting an 85 percent drop in operating profits.[13]
History[edit]
When the Canadian Pacific Railway was formed, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald compensated it for assuming the risk of developing the railroad that bound Canada from coast to coast with the subsurface rights for a checkerboard pattern of most of Alberta and part of Saskatchewan.[14] EnCana inherited these subsurface mineral rights.[citation needed] In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway drilled for water near Medicine Hat, AB and discovered natural gas.[citation needed]
In 1958, Canadian Pacific created 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' to manage its oil and gas properties and its mineral rights.[citation needed]
In 1971, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas merged with 'Central-Del Rio Oils' resulting in 'Pan Canadian Petroleum Limited'.[citation needed]
In 2002, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was spun out of Canadian Pacific Limited. It subsequently merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana.[1] In April 2002, EnCana Corporation launched operations with President and CEO Gwyn Morgan.[15] "Its initial goal [was]... a big company that couldn’t be taken over."[11] that resulted in the disposition of producing assets in Ecuador and the North Sea, as well as exploratory assets in Chad, Ghana, Brazil, Australia, the Mackenzie Delta, and the Middle East.[16]
In spring 2008 residents from Pavillion, Wyoming approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency about changes in water quality from their domestic wells.[17] In May 2008 EnCana announced to split into a gas and an oil company.[18]
In 2009, the EPA announced that it had found hydrocarbon contaminants in residents’ drinking water wells in Pavilion, Wyoming.[17] In November 2009, EnCana split into a company focusing on North American natural gas production representing about two-thirds of the company's production and its reserves, that retained the name EnCana, and an oil company named Cenovus Energy.[18]
In 2011, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index included Encana for the first time.[19] In November 2011, a potential buyer backed out of buying the Pavilion gas field.[20] 2011 net earnings slumped to 128 million from over one billion the year before.[2]
In February 2012, Mitsubishi paid approximately C$2.9 billion for a 40 percent interest in the Cutbank Ridge Partnership with Encana, which involves 409,000 net acres of Montney Formation natural gas lands in northeast British Columbia.[21] In December 2012, Encana announced a $US 2.1 billion joint venture with state-owned, Beijing-based PetroChina[5] through which PetroChina would have received a 49.9 percent stake in Encana’s Duvernay Formation acreage in Alberta. This was in line with the rules that "favor minority stakes over takeovers" since Prime Minister Stephen Harper's December 7, 2012 prohibition of purchases by state-owned enterprises seeking to invest in Canadian oil sands.[5] The deal later fell flat. At the end of 2012, Encana's staff had increased to 4,169 employees.[11]
During 2013 Encana's cash flow decreased. The company cut dividends by more than two thirds, and shares fell by more than 15 per cent. In November 2013 it announced a "restructuring plan", to lay off 20 per cent of its employees, to close its office in Plano, Texas, to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta.[11] It planned to invest three quarters of its 2014 capital into five projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay shale in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska.[11]
In September 2014, Encana announced that it would acquire Athlon Energy Inc for $7.1 billion.[22] In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired Encana's Jonah field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming, from Encana (USA).
Lawsuits[edit]
From 2008 through 2010 Encana (USA) accumulated a "large land position" of 250,000 net acres at an "average $150/acre" in the Collingwood-Utica Shale gas play in Michigan's Middle Ordovician Collingwood formation.[23][better source needed] In May 2012 Encana had paid about $185 an acre for oil and gas rights on 2,156 acres (873 hectares) at an auction by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which was "88 percent less than the average paid two years ago in the area".[24] In July 2012, Reuters reported about e-mails between Encana and Chesapeake Energy, America's second-largest natural gas producer, to divide up Michigan counties state land leases for an October 2010 auction to suppress land prices.[25] In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against Encana and Chesapeake for bid rigging.[26] Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; As of 2014[update] the IRS and SEC are also still investigating.
In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the Judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ's supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ's rules for oil and gas operations.[27] In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did "not have standing", because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case.[28]
In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against Encana Corporation and the British Columbia's Oil and Gas Commission for excessive water use from lakes and rivers for its hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, "granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act".[29]
Criticism[edit]
In northeastern British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community.[30] Encana's hydraulic fracturing operations in the US are visible in the 2010 documentary, Gasland[citation needed], which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, as well as air and soil pollution.
Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a "streamlined regulatory process" without public hearings.[31]
Sustainability[edit]
Annually, Encana publishes a Sustainability Report in which they voluntarily disclose a wide variety of operational statistics including energy usage, emissions intensity, GHG emissions, water usage, flared and vented volumes, reportable spills, reclaimed land, community investment, aboriginal engagement, employee education, ethical controls, governance practices, corruption prevention activities, total staff, attrition, gender ratio's, safety and recordable injuries, and an independent assurance of all statistics.[32] All data is shown annually, benchmarked against prior years. If the metric is trending unfavorably, Encana details how it is addressing the issue.

Encana Corporation produces, transports and markets natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs). It was formed in 2002 and descends from the 19th century Canadian Pacific Railway and 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' in the 20th century, respectively. All of Encana’s reserves and production are located in North America since other international assets were divested in the mid-2000s. The corporate headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta. Encana has onshore operations in Alberta and northeast British Columbia and a development off the coast of Nova Scotia. In the United States, Encana's subsidiary operates in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Texas, and Louisiana. After incorporating in 2006, Encana Corporation formed two subsidiaries in 2009, with Encana operating in "unconventional natural gas and natural gas liquids exploration, processing, and transportation, and an integrated oil company called Cenovus Energy.
In October 2015, Encana announced it would sell its Colorado oil and gas assets for $900 million.[4]

Canadian operations[edit]
Encana is Canada’s largest natural gas producer (Penty 2012-12 China Institute)[5] with a large land position in western Canada of 7.0 million net acres, of which about 3.2 million net acres are undeveloped.[6]
Encana's natural gas resource plays include: Bighorn in west central Alberta, Coalbed Methane, Cutbank Ridge in northern British Columbia, Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Clearwater in southern Alberta, including the emerging Clearwater Oil play, and Greater Sierra in northeast British Columbia. The Duvernay in west central Alberta is an emerging play.[7] The Deep Panuke project produces and processes natural gas from approximately 250 kilometers offshore southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2013.[8]
As of 31 December 2012[update] Bighorn is a 307,000 gross acres (266,000 net acres) resource play in west central Alberta with Resthaven, Kakwa, Redrock and Berland as primary properties. In 2012, Encana drilled approximately 31 net wells and produced about 242,000 barrels per day of natural gas and approximately 5,800 barrels per day of oil and NGLs.[7]
Cutbank Ridge is in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foothills, southwest of Dawson Creek, British Columbia. As of 31 December 2012[update] Encana controlled about 467,000 gross undeveloped acres (240,000 net acres) over the deep basin Montney formation of which 85,000 net acres have been developed since 2006 near Dawson Creek.[7]
At Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Encana drills into the Montney Formation, where it controls about 254,000 gross undeveloped acres (236,000 net acres). As of 31 December 2012[update], about 26 net wells produced 108,000 barrels per day of natural gas and 2,900 barrels per day of oil and NGLs after royalties. Encana is a 60% owner of the Sexsmith plant, which has a total capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, after it sold compression and gathering lines in the Sexsmith and Pipestone areas to an "unrelated third party". At the same time, the Gordondale sour gas deep cut plant started production with a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to yield 1,700 thousand barrels per day after royalties.[7]
US operations[edit]
Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. is the US subsidiary of Encana Corporation and headquartered in Denver. It has interest in approximately 2.6 million net acres of land in the US, of which 2.1 million net acres were undeveloped as of 2012.[6] In December 2011, Encana closed the sale of the majority of its North Texas natural gas producing properties.[9] As of 2012[update] key resource plays included: the Haynesville Shale in southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas, Jonah Field in Wyoming, Wattenberg Gas Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (abbreviated DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.[10] For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. It also has oil interests in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale on the border between Mississippi and Louisiana.
By 2013 Encana (USA) was funding about 30 different plays.[11]
Production and profits[edit]
At year end 2011, the company’s average production was 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and 24,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.[2] It had more than 3500 employees per its April 2011 prospectus.[10] Since 2012 the company's strategy has been to "divest its low-profit generating assets and focus on the lucrative core business of natural gas and liquids production".[12]
On February 25, 2015 Encana cut $700 million from its 2015 budget after reporting an 85 percent drop in operating profits.[13]
History[edit]
When the Canadian Pacific Railway was formed, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald compensated it for assuming the risk of developing the railroad that bound Canada from coast to coast with the subsurface rights for a checkerboard pattern of most of Alberta and part of Saskatchewan.[14] EnCana inherited these subsurface mineral rights.[citation needed] In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway drilled for water near Medicine Hat, AB and discovered natural gas.[citation needed]
In 1958, Canadian Pacific created 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' to manage its oil and gas properties and its mineral rights.[citation needed]
In 1971, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas merged with 'Central-Del Rio Oils' resulting in 'Pan Canadian Petroleum Limited'.[citation needed]
In 2002, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was spun out of Canadian Pacific Limited. It subsequently merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana.[1] In April 2002, EnCana Corporation launched operations with President and CEO Gwyn Morgan.[15] "Its initial goal [was]... a big company that couldn’t be taken over."[11] that resulted in the disposition of producing assets in Ecuador and the North Sea, as well as exploratory assets in Chad, Ghana, Brazil, Australia, the Mackenzie Delta, and the Middle East.[16]
In spring 2008 residents from Pavillion, Wyoming approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency about changes in water quality from their domestic wells.[17] In May 2008 EnCana announced to split into a gas and an oil company.[18]
In 2009, the EPA announced that it had found hydrocarbon contaminants in residents’ drinking water wells in Pavilion, Wyoming.[17] In November 2009, EnCana split into a company focusing on North American natural gas production representing about two-thirds of the company's production and its reserves, that retained the name EnCana, and an oil company named Cenovus Energy.[18]
In 2011, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index included Encana for the first time.[19] In November 2011, a potential buyer backed out of buying the Pavilion gas field.[20] 2011 net earnings slumped to 128 million from over one billion the year before.[2]
In February 2012, Mitsubishi paid approximately C$2.9 billion for a 40 percent interest in the Cutbank Ridge Partnership with Encana, which involves 409,000 net acres of Montney Formation natural gas lands in northeast British Columbia.[21] In December 2012, Encana announced a $US 2.1 billion joint venture with state-owned, Beijing-based PetroChina[5] through which PetroChina would have received a 49.9 percent stake in Encana’s Duvernay Formation acreage in Alberta. This was in line with the rules that "favor minority stakes over takeovers" since Prime Minister Stephen Harper's December 7, 2012 prohibition of purchases by state-owned enterprises seeking to invest in Canadian oil sands.[5] The deal later fell flat. At the end of 2012, Encana's staff had increased to 4,169 employees.[11]
During 2013 Encana's cash flow decreased. The company cut dividends by more than two thirds, and shares fell by more than 15 per cent. In November 2013 it announced a "restructuring plan", to lay off 20 per cent of its employees, to close its office in Plano, Texas, to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta.[11] It planned to invest three quarters of its 2014 capital into five projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay shale in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska.[11]
In September 2014, Encana announced that it would acquire Athlon Energy Inc for $7.1 billion.[22] In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired Encana's Jonah field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming, from Encana (USA).
Lawsuits[edit]
From 2008 through 2010 Encana (USA) accumulated a "large land position" of 250,000 net acres at an "average $150/acre" in the Collingwood-Utica Shale gas play in Michigan's Middle Ordovician Collingwood formation.[23][better source needed] In May 2012 Encana had paid about $185 an acre for oil and gas rights on 2,156 acres (873 hectares) at an auction by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which was "88 percent less than the average paid two years ago in the area".[24] In July 2012, Reuters reported about e-mails between Encana and Chesapeake Energy, America's second-largest natural gas producer, to divide up Michigan counties state land leases for an October 2010 auction to suppress land prices.[25] In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against Encana and Chesapeake for bid rigging.[26] Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; As of 2014[update] the IRS and SEC are also still investigating.
In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the Judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ's supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ's rules for oil and gas operations.[27] In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did "not have standing", because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case.[28]
In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against Encana Corporation and the British Columbia's Oil and Gas Commission for excessive water use from lakes and rivers for its hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, "granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act".[29]
Criticism[edit]
In northeastern British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community.[30] Encana's hydraulic fracturing operations in the US are visible in the 2010 documentary, Gasland[citation needed], which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, as well as air and soil pollution.
Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a "streamlined regulatory process" without public hearings.[31]
Sustainability[edit]
Annually, Encana publishes a Sustainability Report in which they voluntarily disclose a wide variety of operational statistics including energy usage, emissions intensity, GHG emissions, water usage, flared and vented volumes, reportable spills, reclaimed land, community investment, aboriginal engagement, employee education, ethical controls, governance practices, corruption prevention activities, total staff, attrition, gender ratio's, safety and recordable injuries, and an independent assurance of all statistics.[32] All data is shown annually, benchmarked against prior years. If the metric is trending unfavorably, Encana details how it is addressing the issue.

Canadian operations[edit]
Encana is Canada’s largest natural gas producer (Penty 2012-12 China Institute)[5] with a large land position in western Canada of 7.0 million net acres, of which about 3.2 million net acres are undeveloped.[6]
Encana's natural gas resource plays include: Bighorn in west central Alberta, Coalbed Methane, Cutbank Ridge in northern British Columbia, Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Clearwater in southern Alberta, including the emerging Clearwater Oil play, and Greater Sierra in northeast British Columbia. The Duvernay in west central Alberta is an emerging play.[7] The Deep Panuke project produces and processes natural gas from approximately 250 kilometers offshore southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2013.[8]
As of 31 December 2012[update] Bighorn is a 307,000 gross acres (266,000 net acres) resource play in west central Alberta with Resthaven, Kakwa, Redrock and Berland as primary properties. In 2012, Encana drilled approximately 31 net wells and produced about 242,000 barrels per day of natural gas and approximately 5,800 barrels per day of oil and NGLs.[7]
Cutbank Ridge is in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foothills, southwest of Dawson Creek, British Columbia.

At Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Encana drills into the Montney Formation, where it controls about 254,000 gross undeveloped acres (236,000 net acres). As of 31 December 2012[update], about 26 net wells produced 108,000 barrels per day of natural gas and 2,900 barrels per day of oil and NGLs after royalties. Encana is a 60% owner of the Sexsmith plant, which has a total capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, after it sold compression and gathering lines in the Sexsmith and Pipestone areas to an "unrelated third party". At the same time, the Gordondale sour gas deep cut plant started production with a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to yield 1,700 thousand barrels per day after royalties.[7]
US operations[edit]
Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. is the US subsidiary of Encana Corporation and headquartered in Denver. It has interest in approximately 2.6 million net acres of land in the US, of which 2.1 million net acres were undeveloped as of 2012.[6] In December 2011, Encana closed the sale of the majority of its North Texas natural gas producing properties.[9] As of 2012[update] key resource plays included: the Haynesville Shale in southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas, Jonah Field in Wyoming, Wattenberg Gas Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (abbreviated DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.[10] For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. It also has oil interests in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale on the border between Mississippi and Louisiana.
By 2013 Encana (USA) was funding about 30 different plays.[11]
Production and profits[edit]
At year end 2011, the company’s average production was 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and 24,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.[2] It had more than 3500 employees per its April 2011 prospectus.[10] Since 2012 the company's strategy has been to "divest its low-profit generating assets and focus on the lucrative core business of natural gas and liquids production".[12]

In November 2013 it announced a "restructuring plan", to lay off 20 per cent of its employees, to close its office in Plano, Texas, to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta.[11] It planned to invest three quarters of its 2014 capital into five projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay shale in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska.[11]
In September 2014, Encana announced that it would acquire Athlon Energy Inc for $7.1 billion.[22] In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired Encana's Jonah field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming, from Encana (USA).

From 2008 through 2010 Encana (USA) accumulated a "large land position" of 250,000 net acres at an "average $150/acre" in the Collingwood-Utica Shale gas play in Michigan's Middle Ordovician Collingwood formation.[23][better source needed] In May 2012 Encana had paid about $185 an acre for oil and gas rights on 2,156 acres (873 hectares) at an auction by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which was "88 percent less than the average paid two years ago in the area".[24] In July 2012, Reuters reported about e-mails between Encana and Chesapeake Energy, America's second-largest natural gas producer, to divide up Michigan counties state land leases for an October 2010 auction to suppress land prices.[25] In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against Encana and Chesapeake for bid rigging.[26] Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; As of 2014[update] the IRS and SEC are also still investigating.
In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the Judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ's supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ's rules for oil and gas operations.[27] In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did "not have standing", because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case.[28]
In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against Encana Corporation and the British Columbia's Oil and Gas Commission for excessive water use from lakes and rivers for its hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, "granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act".[29]
Criticism[edit]
In northeastern British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community.[30] Encana's hydraulic fracturing operations in the US are visible in the 2010 documentary, Gasland[citation needed], which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, as well as air and soil pollution.
Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a "streamlined regulatory process" without public hearings.[31]
Sustainability[edit]
Annually, Encana publishes a Sustainability Report in which they voluntarily disclose a wide variety of operational statistics including energy usage, emissions intensity, GHG emissions, water usage, flared and vented volumes, reportable spills, reclaimed land, community investment, aboriginal engagement, employee education, ethical controls, governance practices, corruption prevention activities, total staff, attrition, gender ratio's, safety and recordable injuries, and an independent assurance of all statistics.[32] All data is shown annually, benchmarked against prior years. If the metric is trending unfavorably, Encana details how it is addressing the issue.

Encana Corporation produces, transports and markets natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs). It was formed in 2002 and descends from the 19th century Canadian Pacific Railway and 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' in the 20th century, respectively. All of Encana’s reserves and production are located in North America since other international assets were divested in the mid-2000s. The corporate headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta. Encana has onshore operations in Alberta and northeast British Columbia and a development off the coast of Nova Scotia. In the United States, Encana's subsidiary operates in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Texas, and Louisiana. After incorporating in 2006, Encana Corporation formed two subsidiaries in 2009, with Encana operating in "unconventional natural gas and natural gas liquids exploration, processing, and transportation, and an integrated oil company called Cenovus Energy.
In October 2015, Encana announced it would sell its Colorado oil and gas assets for $900 million.[4]

Canadian operations[edit]
Encana is Canada’s largest natural gas producer (Penty 2012-12 China Institute)[5] with a large land position in western Canada of 7.0 million net acres, of which about 3.2 million net acres are undeveloped.[6]
Encana's natural gas resource plays include: Bighorn in west central Alberta, Coalbed Methane, Cutbank Ridge in northern British Columbia, Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Clearwater in southern Alberta, including the emerging Clearwater Oil play, and Greater Sierra in northeast British Columbia. The Duvernay in west central Alberta is an emerging play.[7] The Deep Panuke project produces and processes natural gas from approximately 250 kilometers offshore southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2013.[8]
As of 31 December 2012[update] Bighorn is a 307,000 gross acres (266,000 net acres) resource play in west central Alberta with Resthaven, Kakwa, Redrock and Berland as primary properties. In 2012, Encana drilled approximately 31 net wells and produced about 242,000 barrels per day of natural gas and approximately 5,800 barrels per day of oil and NGLs.[7]
Cutbank Ridge is in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foothills, southwest of Dawson Creek, British Columbia. As of 31 December 2012[update] Encana controlled about 467,000 gross undeveloped acres (240,000 net acres) over the deep basin Montney formation of which 85,000 net acres have been developed since 2006 near Dawson Creek.[7]
At Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Encana drills into the Montney Formation, where it controls about 254,000 gross undeveloped acres (236,000 net acres). As of 31 December 2012[update], about 26 net wells produced 108,000 barrels per day of natural gas and 2,900 barrels per day of oil and NGLs after royalties. Encana is a 60% owner of the Sexsmith plant, which has a total capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, after it sold compression and gathering lines in the Sexsmith and Pipestone areas to an "unrelated third party". At the same time, the Gordondale sour gas deep cut plant started production with a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to yield 1,700 thousand barrels per day after royalties.[7]
US operations[edit]
Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. is the US subsidiary of Encana Corporation and headquartered in Denver. It has interest in approximately 2.6 million net acres of land in the US, of which 2.1 million net acres were undeveloped as of 2012.[6] In December 2011, Encana closed the sale of the majority of its North Texas natural gas producing properties.[9] As of 2012[update] key resource plays included: the Haynesville Shale in southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas, Jonah Field in Wyoming, Wattenberg Gas Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (abbreviated DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.[10] For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. It also has oil interests in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale on the border between Mississippi and Louisiana.
By 2013 Encana (USA) was funding about 30 different plays.[11]
Production and profits[edit]
At year end 2011, the company’s average production was 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and 24,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.[2] It had more than 3500 employees per its April 2011 prospectus.[10] Since 2012 the company's strategy has been to "divest its low-profit generating assets and focus on the lucrative core business of natural gas and liquids production".[12]
On February 25, 2015 Encana cut $700 million from its 2015 budget after reporting an 85 percent drop in operating profits.[13]
History[edit]
When the Canadian Pacific Railway was formed, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald compensated it for assuming the risk of developing the railroad that bound Canada from coast to coast with the subsurface rights for a checkerboard pattern of most of Alberta and part of Saskatchewan.[14] EnCana inherited these subsurface mineral rights.[citation needed] In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway drilled for water near Medicine Hat, AB and discovered natural gas.[citation needed]
In 1958, Canadian Pacific created 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' to manage its oil and gas properties and its mineral rights.[citation needed]
In 1971, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas merged with 'Central-Del Rio Oils' resulting in 'Pan Canadian Petroleum Limited'.[citation needed]
In 2002, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was spun out of Canadian Pacific Limited. It subsequently merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana.[1] In April 2002, EnCana Corporation launched operations with President and CEO Gwyn Morgan.[15] "Its initial goal [was]... a big company that couldn’t be taken over."[11] that resulted in the disposition of producing assets in Ecuador and the North Sea, as well as exploratory assets in Chad, Ghana, Brazil, Australia, the Mackenzie Delta, and the Middle East.[16]
In spring 2008 residents from Pavillion, Wyoming approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency about changes in water quality from their domestic wells.[17] In May 2008 EnCana announced to split into a gas and an oil company.[18]
In 2009, the EPA announced that it had found hydrocarbon contaminants in residents’ drinking water wells in Pavilion, Wyoming.[17] In November 2009, EnCana split into a company focusing on North American natural gas production representing about two-thirds of the company's production and its reserves, that retained the name EnCana, and an oil company named Cenovus Energy.[18]
In 2011, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index included Encana for the first time.[19] In November 2011, a potential buyer backed out of buying the Pavilion gas field.[20] 2011 net earnings slumped to 128 million from over one billion the year before.[2]
In February 2012, Mitsubishi paid approximately C$2.9 billion for a 40 percent interest in the Cutbank Ridge Partnership with Encana, which involves 409,000 net acres of Montney Formation natural gas lands in northeast British Columbia.[21] In December 2012, Encana announced a $US 2.1 billion joint venture with state-owned, Beijing-based PetroChina[5] through which PetroChina would have received a 49.9 percent stake in Encana’s Duvernay Formation acreage in Alberta. This was in line with the rules that "favor minority stakes over takeovers" since Prime Minister Stephen Harper's December 7, 2012 prohibition of purchases by state-owned enterprises seeking to invest in Canadian oil sands.[5] The deal later fell flat. At the end of 2012, Encana's staff had increased to 4,169 employees.[11]
During 2013 Encana's cash flow decreased. The company cut dividends by more than two thirds, and shares fell by more than 15 per cent. In November 2013 it announced a "restructuring plan", to lay off 20 per cent of its employees, to close its office in Plano, Texas, to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta.[11] It planned to invest three quarters of its 2014 capital into five projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay shale in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska.[11]
In September 2014, Encana announced that it would acquire Athlon Energy Inc for $7.1 billion.[22] In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired Encana's Jonah field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming, from Encana (USA).
Lawsuits[edit]

Sustainability[edit]
Annually, Encana publishes a Sustainability Report in which they voluntarily disclose a wide variety of operational statistics including energy usage, emissions intensity, GHG emissions, water usage, flared and vented volumes, reportable spills, reclaimed land, community investment, aboriginal engagement, employee education, ethical controls, governance practices, corruption prevention activities, total staff, attrition, gender ratio's, safety and recordable injuries, and an independent assurance of all statistics.[32] All data is shown annually, benchmarked against prior years. If the metric is trending unfavorably, Encana details how it is addressing the issue.

Canadian operations[edit]
Encana is Canada’s largest natural gas producer (Penty 2012-12 China Institute)[5] with a large land position in western Canada of 7.0 million net acres, of which about 3.2 million net acres are undeveloped.[6]
Encana's natural gas resource plays include: Bighorn in west central Alberta, Coalbed Methane, Cutbank Ridge in northern British Columbia, Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Clearwater in southern Alberta, including the emerging Clearwater Oil play, and Greater Sierra in northeast British Columbia. The Duvernay in west central Alberta is an emerging play.[7] The Deep Panuke project produces and processes natural gas from approximately 250 kilometers offshore southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2013.[8]
As of 31 December 2012[update] Bighorn is a 307,000 gross acres (266,000 net acres) resource play in west central Alberta with Resthaven, Kakwa, Redrock and Berland as primary properties. In 2012, Encana drilled approximately 31 net wells and produced about 242,000 barrels per day of natural gas and approximately 5,800 barrels per day of oil and NGLs.[7]
Cutbank Ridge is in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foothills, southwest of Dawson Creek, British Columbia. As of 31 December 2012[update] Encana controlled about 467,000 gross undeveloped acres (240,000 net acres) over the deep basin Montney formation of which 85,000 net acres have been developed since 2006 near Dawson Creek.[7]
At Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Encana drills into the Montney Formation, where it controls about 254,000 gross undeveloped acres (236,000 net acres). As of 31 December 2012[update], about 26 net wells produced 108,000 barrels per day of natural gas and 2,900 barrels per day of oil and NGLs after royalties. Encana is a 60% owner of the Sexsmith plant, which has a total capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, after it sold compression and gathering lines in the Sexsmith and Pipestone areas to an "unrelated third party". At the same time, the Gordondale sour gas deep cut plant started production with a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to yield 1,700 thousand barrels per day after royalties.[7]
US operations[edit]
Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. is the US subsidiary of Encana Corporation and headquartered in Denver. It has interest in approximately 2.6 million net acres of land in the US, of which 2.1 million net acres were undeveloped as of 2012.[6] In December 2011, Encana closed the sale of the majority of its North Texas natural gas producing properties.[9] As of 2012[update] key resource plays included: the Haynesville Shale in southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas, Jonah Field in Wyoming, Wattenberg Gas Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (abbreviated DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.[10] For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. It also has oil interests in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale on the border between Mississippi and Louisiana.
By 2013 Encana (USA) was funding about 30 different plays.[11]
Production and profits[edit]
At year end 2011, the company’s average production was 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and 24,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.[2] It had more than 3500 employees per its April 2011 prospectus.[10] Since 2012 the company's strategy has been to "divest its low-profit generating assets and focus on the lucrative core business of natural gas and liquids production".[12]
On February 25, 2015 Encana cut $700 million from its 2015 budget after reporting an 85 percent drop in operating profits.[13]
History[edit]
When the Canadian Pacific Railway was formed, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald compensated it for assuming the risk of developing the railroad that bound Canada from coast to coast with the subsurface rights for a checkerboard pattern of most of Alberta and part of Saskatchewan.[14] EnCana inherited these subsurface mineral rights.[citation needed] In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway drilled for water near Medicine Hat, AB and discovered natural gas.[citation needed]
In 1958, Canadian Pacific created 'Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas' to manage its oil and gas properties and its mineral rights.[citation needed]
In 1971, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas merged with 'Central-Del Rio Oils' resulting in 'Pan Canadian Petroleum Limited'.[citation needed]
In 2002, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was spun out of Canadian Pacific Limited. It subsequently merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana.[1] In April 2002, EnCana Corporation launched operations with President and CEO Gwyn Morgan.[15] "Its initial goal [was]... a big company that couldn’t be taken over."[11] that resulted in the disposition of producing assets in Ecuador and the North Sea, as well as exploratory assets in Chad, Ghana, Brazil, Australia, the Mackenzie Delta, and the Middle East.[16]
In spring 2008 residents from Pavillion, Wyoming approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency about changes in water quality from their domestic wells.[17] In May 2008 EnCana announced to split into a gas and an oil company.[18]
In 2009, the EPA announced that it had found hydrocarbon contaminants in residents’ drinking water wells in Pavilion, Wyoming.[17] In November 2009, EnCana split into a company focusing on North American natural gas production representing about two-thirds of the company's production and its reserves, that retained the name EnCana, and an oil company named Cenovus Energy.[18]
In 2011, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index included Encana for the first time.[19] In November 2011, a potential buyer backed out of buying the Pavilion gas field.[20] 2011 net earnings slumped to 128 million from over one billion the year before.[2]
In February 2012, Mitsubishi paid approximately C$2.9 billion for a 40 percent interest in the Cutbank Ridge Partnership with Encana, which involves 409,000 net acres of Montney Formation natural gas lands in northeast British Columbia.[21] In December 2012, Encana announced a $US 2.1 billion joint venture with state-owned, Beijing-based PetroChina[5] through which PetroChina would have received a 49.9 percent stake in Encana’s Duvernay Formation acreage in Alberta. This was in line with the rules that "favor minority stakes over takeovers" since Prime Minister Stephen Harper's December 7, 2012 prohibition of purchases by state-owned enterprises seeking to invest in Canadian oil sands.[5] The deal later fell flat. At the end of 2012, Encana's staff had increased to 4,169 employees.[11]
During 2013 Encana's cash flow decreased. The company cut dividends by more than two thirds, and shares fell by more than 15 per cent. In November 2013 it announced a "restructuring plan", to lay off 20 per cent of its employees, to close its office in Plano, Texas, to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta.[11] It planned to invest three quarters of its 2014 capital into five projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay shale in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska.[11]
In September 2014, Encana announced that it would acquire Athlon Energy Inc for $7.1 billion.[22] In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired Encana's Jonah field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming, from Encana (USA).
Lawsuits[edit]
From 2008 through 2010 Encana (USA) accumulated a "large land position" of 250,000 net acres at an "average $150/acre" in the Collingwood-Utica Shale gas play in Michigan's Middle Ordovician Collingwood formation.[23][better source needed] In May 2012 Encana had paid about $185 an acre for oil and gas rights on 2,156 acres (873 hectares) at an auction by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which was "88 percent less than the average paid two years ago in the area".[24] In July 2012, Reuters reported about e-mails between Encana and Chesapeake Energy, America's second-largest natural gas producer, to divide up Michigan counties state land leases for an October 2010 auction to suppress land prices.[25] In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against Encana and Chesapeake for bid rigging.[26] Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; As of 2014[update] the IRS and SEC are also still investigating.
In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the Judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ's supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ's rules for oil and gas operations.[27] In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did "not have standing", because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case.[28]
In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against Encana Corporation and the British Columbia's Oil and Gas Commission for excessive water use from lakes and rivers for its hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, "granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act".[29]
Criticism[edit]
In northeastern British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community.[30] Encana's hydraulic fracturing operations in the US are visible in the 2010 documentary, Gasland[citation needed], which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, as well as air and soil pollution.
Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a "streamlined regulatory process" without public hearings.[31]
Sustainability[edit]
Annually, Encana publishes a Sustainability Report in which they voluntarily disclose a wide variety of operational statistics including energy usage, emissions intensity, GHG emissions, water usage, flared and vented volumes, reportable spills, reclaimed land, community investment, aboriginal engagement, employee education, ethical controls, governance practices, corruption prevention activities, total staff, attrition, gender ratio's, safety and recordable injuries, and an independent assurance of all statistics.[32] All data is shown annually, benchmarked against prior years. If the metric is trending unfavorably, Encana details how it is addressing the issue.

At Peace River Arch in northwest Alberta, Encana drills into the Montney Formation, where it controls about 254,000 gross undeveloped acres (236,000 net acres). As of 31 December 2012[update], about 26 net wells produced 108,000 barrels per day of natural gas and 2,900 barrels per day of oil and NGLs after royalties. Encana is a 60% owner of the Sexsmith plant, which has a total capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, after it sold compression and gathering lines in the Sexsmith and Pipestone areas to an "unrelated third party". At the same time, the Gordondale sour gas deep cut plant started production with a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to yield 1,700 thousand barrels per day after royalties.[7]

Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. is the US subsidiary of Encana Corporation and headquartered in Denver. It has interest in approximately 2.6 million net acres of land in the US, of which 2.1 million net acres were undeveloped as of 2012.[6] In December 2011, Encana closed the sale of the majority of its North Texas natural gas producing properties.[9] As of 2012[update] key resource plays included: the Haynesville Shale in southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas, Jonah Field in Wyoming, Wattenberg Gas Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (abbreviated DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.[10] For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. It also has oil interests in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale on the border between Mississippi and Louisiana.
By 2013 Encana (USA) was funding about 30 different plays.[11]
Production and profits[edit]
At year end 2011, the company’s average production was 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and 24,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.[2] It had more than 3500 employees per its April 2011 prospectus.[10] Since 2012 the company's strategy has been to "divest its low-profit generating assets and focus on the lucrative core business of natural gas and liquids production".[12]
On February 25, 2015 Encana cut $700 million from its 2015 budget after reporting an 85 percent drop in operating profits.[13]
History[edit]
When the Canadian Pacific Railway was formed, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald compensated it for assuming the risk of developing the railroad that bound Canada from coast to coast with the subsurface rights for a checkerboard pattern of most of Alberta and part of Saskatchewan.[14] EnCana inherited these subsurface mineral rights.[citation needed] In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway drilled for water near Medicine Hat, AB and discovered natural gas.[citation needed]

In 2002, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was spun out of Canadian Pacific Limited. It subsequently merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana.[1] In April 2002, EnCana Corporation launched operations with President and CEO Gwyn Morgan.[15] "Its initial goal [was]... a big company that couldn’t be taken over."[11] that resulted in the disposition of producing assets in Ecuador and the North Sea, as well as exploratory assets in Chad, Ghana, Brazil, Australia, the Mackenzie Delta, and the Middle East.[16]
In spring 2008 residents from Pavillion, Wyoming approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency about changes in water quality from their domestic wells.[17] In May 2008 EnCana announced to split into a gas and an oil company.[18]

In 2011, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index included Encana for the first time.[19] In November 2011, a potential buyer backed out of buying the Pavilion gas field.[20] 2011 net earnings slumped to 128 million from over one billion the year before.[2]
In February 2012, Mitsubishi paid approximately C$2.9 billion for a 40 percent interest in the Cutbank Ridge Partnership with Encana, which involves 409,000 net acres of Montney Formation natural gas lands in northeast British Columbia.[21] In December 2012, Encana announced a $US 2.1 billion joint venture with state-owned, Beijing-based PetroChina[5] through which PetroChina would have received a 49.9 percent stake in Encana’s Duvernay Formation acreage in Alberta. This was in line with the rules that "favor minority stakes over takeovers" since Prime Minister Stephen Harper's December 7, 2012 prohibition of purchases by state-owned enterprises seeking to invest in Canadian oil sands.[5] The deal later fell flat. At the end of 2012, Encana's staff had increased to 4,169 employees.[11]
During 2013 Encana's cash flow decreased. The company cut dividends by more than two thirds, and shares fell by more than 15 per cent. In November 2013 it announced a "restructuring plan", to lay off 20 per cent of its employees, to close its office in Plano, Texas, to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta.[11] It planned to invest three quarters of its 2014 capital into five projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay shale in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, extending into Wyoming and Nebraska.[11]
In September 2014, Encana announced that it would acquire Athlon Energy Inc for $7.1 billion.[22] In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired Encana's Jonah field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming, from Encana (USA).
Lawsuits[edit]
From 2008 through 2010 Encana (USA) accumulated a "large land position" of 250,000 net acres at an "average $150/acre" in the Collingwood-Utica Shale gas play in Michigan's Middle Ordovician Collingwood formation.[23][better source needed] In May 2012 Encana had paid about $185 an acre for oil and gas rights on 2,156 acres (873 hectares) at an auction by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which was "88 percent less than the average paid two years ago in the area".[24] In July 2012, Reuters reported about e-mails between Encana and Chesapeake Energy, America's second-largest natural gas producer, to divide up Michigan counties state land leases for an October 2010 auction to suppress land prices.[25] In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against Encana and Chesapeake for bid rigging.[26] Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; As of 2014[update] the IRS and SEC are also still investigating.
In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the Judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ's supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ's rules for oil and gas operations.[27] In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did "not have standing", because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case.[28]
In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against Encana Corporation and the British Columbia's Oil and Gas Commission for excessive water use from lakes and rivers for its hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, "granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act".[29]
Criticism[edit]
In northeastern British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community.[30] Encana's hydraulic fracturing operations in the US are visible in the 2010 documentary, Gasland[citation needed], which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, as well as air and soil pollution.
Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a "streamlined regulatory process" without public hearings.[31]
Sustainability[edit]
Annually, Encana publishes a Sustainability Report in which they voluntarily disclose a wide variety of operational statistics including energy usage, emissions intensity, GHG emissions, water usage, flared and vented volumes, reportable spills, reclaimed land, community investment, aboriginal engagement, employee education, ethical controls, governance practices, corruption prevention activities, total staff, attrition, gender ratio's, safety and recordable injuries, and an independent assurance of all statistics.[32] All data is shown annually, benchmarked against prior years. If the metric is trending unfavorably, Encana details how it is addressing the issue.

CAPP's Guiding Principles on Hydraulic Fracturing
Digging Deeper: Get the Facts on Hydraulic Fracturing (CAPP Video)











Responsible Products Program
We have developed and implemented a company-wide program to manage the chemical additives or products we use in our hydraulic fracturing operations.
Our Responsible Products Program helps ensure that the hydraulic fracturing fluid products we use in our operations are as safe, effective and as environmentally responsible as possible. The program categorizes the products we use based on their potential health and environmental impacts. After we have assessed a specific product, we are then able to make a decision as to whether that product is allowed to be used in our operations.
Encana prohibits the use of  hydraulic fracturing fluid products containing diesel fuels, the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury, 2-Butoxyethanol (2-BE) or benzene, and we will inform our suppliers/vendors that any product containing these additives cannot be used in our hydraulic fracturing operations.
How does the Responsible Products Program Work?
Our Responsible Products Program is a risk-based product assessment and management program. All of the hydraulic fracturing fluid products we use are carefully assessed based on their potential risk to human health or the environment. The program’s components include: 

Collecting product data and information (primarily from Material Safety Data Sheets).
Assessing the products using our CAPP Responsible Product Assessment Tool.
Classifying the products into one of three categories.
Identifying and implementing any required operational practices and/or controls, to ensure responsible use of the products or eliminating the products from use.

What is the classification criteria based on?
To ensure that all of our product assessments are thorough, objective and accurate, we developed the Responsible Product Assessment Tool , in conjunction with a third party toxicology service provider and which has been endorsed by CAPP (Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers). This tool , which we we now call the CAPP Responsible Product Assessment Tool  uses government databases and information from Environment Canada, the European Union, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygenists as the basis for its classification.

Why Energy Producer Encana’s Stock Has Leaped Higher After Earnings

Calgary-based energy producer Encana Corp. (NYSE: ECA) on Friday reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, shattering the consensus estimate of $0.04 per share. Revenue climbed to $1.08 billion, well above the consensus estimate of $796.65 million. In the year-ago quarter, Encana posted EPS of $0.10 and revenue of $364 million.
Operating expenses fell to $762 million from $1.27 billion in the second quarter of 2016, and operating income totaled $321 million after posting a loss of $912 million a year ago. Net earnings totaled $331 million compared with 2016 second-quarter loss of $601 million. 


Cash flow from operations improved to $351 million from $278 million, juiced by a corporate margin of $12.09 per barrel of oil equivalent, up by 25% year over year.

The company lowered its 2017 total production guidance slightly, to a range of 310,000 to 320,000 barrels per day from 320,000 to 330,000 barrels, primarily in natural gas production. In its core areas, however, Encana expects production to rise by 25% to 30%.
Cash costs are now estimated at $3.60 to $4.00 a barrel, down from $3.75 to $4.25 in the prior outlook. Capex guidance was unchanged at $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for the year.
Chief Executive Officer Doug Suttles said:
“Our updated guidance reflects our strong performance, efficiency and confidence. We are generating significant momentum and are well positioned for 2018 when we expect to grow within cash flow, even if commodity prices remain at today’s levels.”
In a presentation accompanying the earnings announcement, Encana said 75% of second-half production is hedged on oil, gas, and natural gas liquids.
Although Encana did not specify its hedged price, the company’s hedge positions were almost certainly entered into late last year and early this year when crude oil prices were at their recent highs. Most other producers did the same thing and that is one reason why low prices for crude oil have had little impact on production. Producers have locked in higher prices for the rest of this year, and some have even bought hedges for the first part of next year.
Encana’s realized price per barrel on its U.S. second-quarter crude oil production was $46.14 per barrel. Its hedges added $2.17 per barrel.
The company’s stock rose 2.6% to $9.91 a share in late morning trading as is in a 52-week price range of $7.50 to $13.85. Trading volume is already almost 50% higher than the daily average of 12.2 million shares. The stock’s 12-month price target is $12.91.

Encana Corp. is named in three large lawsuits that attempt to link damages from climate change to industry’s alleged attempts to hinder action to address it.In the latest of a growing number of such lawsuits around the world, the Calgary-based company is one of 20 energy majors and their subsidiaries facing claims from three California communities. They allege the companies have deliberately sown misinformation and doubt on climate change and are at least partially responsible for related damages such as shoreline erosion.

“Defendants ... have known for nearly a half century that unrestricted production and use of their fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes our climate,” says the lawsuit filed by the City of Imperial Beach.“They have nevertheless engaged in a co-ordinated, multi-front effort to conceal and deny their own knowledge of those threats, discredit the growing body of publicly available scientific evidence, and persistently create doubt in the minds of customers, consumers, regulators, the media, journalists, teachers, and the public about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution.”Encana has not responded to requests for comment.The lawsuits, filed Monday in California, draw on legal precedents used against tobacco companies, which reached a U.S. settlement of $368.5 billion in 1998.“The plaintiffs have an uphill battle, but these are plausible claims,” said Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.Burger said that, like tobacco companies, the energy industry knew its business was creating problems. Reports quoting documents from Exxon’s archives suggest its management was told by its own scientists about greenhouse gases and climate change as early as 1977.Instead of addressing the problem, the lawsuits allege, industry deployed think tanks, lobbyists and other means to obscure the science and resist regulation — much like the tobacco industry.“You have a similar history of corporate malfeasance,” said Burger.But the climate lawsuits will have a much tougher time linking specific damages to industry actions, he said.“To get from pulling it out of the ground all the way through the chain of manufacture, marketing, combustion — and through the climate change reality and then to sea-level rise causing specific impacts in these places — is a much longer chain of causation.”Similar lawsuits have been thrown out.Vic Sher, the lawyer handling the litigation, said his lawsuits avoid conflicts with federal law that disallowed earlier attempts.Fresh reports have made industry attempts to block change much clearer, he said. As well, research now allows scientists to make direct links between greenhouse gases, sea-level rise and individual producers.“That causal connection we can now tie to particular companies.”The claim alleges the defendants are collectively behind about 20 per cent of total CO2 emissions between 1965 and 2015.“It’s an enormous volume and a substantial contribution to the problem,” Sher said.Kate Sears, supervisor for Marin County just north of San Francisco, said her communities are already suffering.Previously rare flooding tides now occur about 15 times a year, she said. The only roads in and out for some coastal communities have been submerged.A county assessment concluded in April that within 15 years, tidal flooding could threaten at least $15.5-billion in public and private assets, from homes to schools to wetlands.“Climate change is not a theoretical problem for us,” Sears said. “It’s very, very real.”Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor who has published research on similarities between climate change and tobacco liability, said the cases are highly relevant to Canada as different court systems try to deal with the issue.“Everyone’s watching to see what different courts are doing, especially countries that share that common law tradition,” he said. “There’s a cumulative effect — you start to see more and more of these.”A report in March for the United Nations counted 654 cases in 24 countries that dealt with the science of climate change and mitigation efforts.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.16      Net Money Flow ($)  6.11 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
