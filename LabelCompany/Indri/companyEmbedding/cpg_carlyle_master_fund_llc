The Carlyle Group has drawn in nearly $108 million for Carlyle Private Equity Access Fund 2014 since last November, as the New York firm reaches out to high net-worth individuals to broaden its investor base beyond big institutions.
After filing its first Form D for the fund on Nov. 11, Carlyle disclosed nearly $38 million in February and added roughly $20 million a month since then to reach its total as of June 17.
Carlyle is working with Raymond James and LPL Financial to target investors through the respective firms’ wealth channels, according to a source. The names of both firms are listed on the Form D filings for the fund.
A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment.
The fund provides investors with access to various Carlyle private equity funds for qualified purchasers – people with at least $5 million in investable assets, according to a source. The minimum $250,000 commitment is evenly divided between a small number of Carlyle funds.
Currently, the firm is raising capital for several pools. In the first quarter, it drew in a combined $4.4 billion for Carlyle Europe Partners IV, Carlyle Realty Partners VII and Carlyle Equity Opportunity Fund II, its mid-market buyout pool, and others.
The Access fund is Carlyle’s second fund aimed at individuals. CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund tipped the scales at $551 million at the end of 2014. That pool, managed by Central Park Group, invests in dozens of funds and secondary stakes in funds, including a few that aren’t run by Carlyle. CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund is for “accredited” investors, meaning those with at least $1 million in assets not including their residence, and takes minimum investments of $50,000.
Not every initiative aimed at individuals has panned out for Carlyle. The firm has moved to liquidate Carlyle Core Allocation Fund, which drew in $53 million, and the Carlyle Enchanced Commodity Real Return Fund, which had no assets disclosed and was shuttered before it drew in any commitments, according to reports.
For years, Carlyle co-CEO David Rubenstein has been on the stump in support of opening up private equity to individuals. The macro trend of traditional pensions in the form of defined benefit plans giving way to defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s may fuel interest in other asset classes outside stocks and bonds, he said. But he has said it will take time to become a major force.
“All of the legal issues haven’t been resolved … but, inevitably, there will be a desire by people who have IRAs, 401(k)s and other kind of vehicles to participate [in private equity],” Rubenstein said recently. “It’s probably a generational thing before you see a big impact on numbers for firms like ours.”

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Feeder Fund and the Master Fund are continuously offered non-diversified closed-end management investment companies registered under the Act and organized as Delaware limited liability companies. The Feeder Fund operates as a feeder fund in a master-feeder structure and intends to invest substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Master Fund invests primarily in “alternative” investment funds with an emphasis on private equity funds (e.g., buyout, growth, and mezzanine).
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Central Park Group, LLC, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and serves as investment adviser to the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund.
3. The Feeder Fund continuously offers its Units [1] 
           in private placements in reliance on the provisions of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. Units of the Feeder Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system. Applicants do not expect that any secondary market will develop for the Units.
4. The Feeder Fund currently offers a single class of Units (the “Class A Units”) at net asset value per Unit subject to a sales load and annual asset-based distribution fee. The Feeder Fund proposes to offer an additional Unit class (the “Class I Units”) at net asset value that may (but would not necessarily) be subject to a front-end sales load and an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. Both classes would be subject to minimum purchase requirements.
5. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to unitholders, the Feeder Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Units at their then current net asset value in accordance with rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”) pursuant to written tenders by unitholders.[2] 
           Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Feeder Fund's board of trustees (“Board”), in its sole discretion.[3] 
           The Adviser Start Printed Page 28905anticipates to recommend that the Board authorize the Feeder Fund to offer to repurchase Units from unitholders quarterly.
6. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser, or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser acts as investment adviser, and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Units through tender offers conducted in compliance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.[4] 

7. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or distribution fees will comply with the provisions of rule 2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”) as if that rule applied to the Feeder Fund.[5] 
           Applicants also represent that the Feeder Fund will disclose in its Confidential Memorandum, the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Units offered for sale by the Confidential Memorandum, as is required for open-end, multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, the Feeder Fund will disclose its expenses in unitholder reports, and disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads in its Confidential Memorandum.[6] 
           The Feeder Fund will also comply, and will contractually require its placement agency to comply, with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding Confidential Memorandum disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Feeder Fund.[7] 

8. The Feeder Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of Units based on the net assets of the Feeder Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of a Feeder Fund allocated to a particular class of Units will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding Unit of that class. Applicants state that the Feeder Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
9. In the event the Feeder Fund imposes a CDSC, the applicants will comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, as if that rule applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the Feeder Fund will comply with rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Units
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Units of the Feeder Fund may be prohibited by section 18(c). Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Units of the Feeder Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Feeder Fund to issue multiple classes of Units.[8] 

3. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of unitholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Feeder Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Units and provide investors with a broader choice of unitholder options. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that the Feeder Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
CDSCs
4. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Feeder Fund will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Feeder Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Feeder Fund will apply the CDSC (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the CDSC) uniformly to all unitholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an Start Printed Page 28906affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit the Feeder Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

Deputy Secretary.

The Early Withdrawal Fee will equally apply to all investors of the Feeder Fund, regardless of class, consistent with section 18 of the Act and rule 18f-3 under the Act. To the extent the Feeder Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled variations of, or eliminate the Early Withdrawal Fee, it will comply with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as if it were a CDSC and such waiver, scheduled variation or elimination will apply uniformly to all unitholders of the Feeder Fund.

Private equity giant Carlyle Group is shutting down the two mutual funds it launched just a year ago

  Washington

  (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP has decided to liquidate the two
  mutual funds it launched last year, regulatory filings showed
  this week, as the private equity firm seeks other ways to gain
  more traction with so-called liquid alternative funds.


  Developing mutual funds has historically been challenging for
  private equity firms because the average buyout fund is illiquid,
  with a typical life span of 10 years. But as these firms
  diversified into relatively more liquid alternative assets, such
  as credit and hedge funds, they have sought to widen their base
  beyond institutional investors.


  Next month, Carlyle will close Carlyle Global Core Allocation
  Fund, which has $50 million in net assets with a mandate to
  invest across equities, debt, real estate, commodities and
  currencies using exchange-traded funds, according to a filing
  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


  Carlyle Enhanced Commodity Real Return Fund, which had a mandate
  to invest in asset classes such as energy and metals, but never
  took off, will also be wound down, according to a second filing.


  The move leaves Carlyle with Diversified Global Asset Management
  Corp (DGAM), a funds-of-hedge-funds manager it acquired in
  February 2014, as its main platform for launching liquid
  alternative products.

  DGAM has developed a number of liquid alternative funds aimed
  primarily at institutional investors, rather than the retail
  investors who invest in mutual funds.


  Some of these DGAM alternative funds could be marketed soon,
  according to a person with knowledge of Carlyle's plans who was
  not authorized to discuss them publicly. These products perform
  better in the current low-volatility market environment, rather
  than the high-volatility environment that the mutual funds would
  have thrived on, that person added.


  Carlyle could decide to launch another mutual fund in the future,
  the person said.


  A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment.


  The strategic shift comes one year after Carlyle hired Jeff
  Holland, a former senior executive at mutual fund conglomerate
  BlackRock Inc, to lead efforts to introduce alternative assets to
  eligible individual investors.


  Carlyle has also developed other products aimed at increasing the
  liquidity of its traditionally illiquid offerings.


  A captive feeder fund called CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund LLC,
  which allows individuals with net worth in excess of $1 million
  to commit as little as $50,000 to its private equity fund
  portfolio, had $550 million in net assets at the end of December.


  A business development company called Carlyle GMS Finance Inc,
  which lends to midsize U.S. companies, had $338.3 million in net
  assets at the end of last year. Carlyle plans to eventually take
  that vehicle public.


  Washington-based Carlyle, founded in 1987 by David Rubenstein,
  William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello, had $194 billion in assets
  under management as of the end of December.

The information required to be included in Part C is set forth under the appropriate Item, so numbered, in Part C of the Registration Statement.

�
�
PART A
�
Responses to Items 1, 2, 3.2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Part A have been omitted pursuant to Paragraph 3 of Instruction G of the General Instructions to Form N-2.
�
Responses to certain Items required to be included in Part A of this Registration Statement are incorporated herein by reference from the Registration Statement on Form N-2 of CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund, LLC (the "Feeder Fund"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2012 (the "Feeder Fund's Registration Statement").��The Feeder Fund and CPG Carlyle Private Equity Master Fund, LLC (the "Master Fund") are organized in what is commonly referred to as a "master-feeder" structure.��The Feeder Fund is the initial feeder fund in this "master-feeder" structure and the Master Fund anticipates that it may from time to time permit feeder funds in addition to the Feeder Fund to invest in the Master Fund.��Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined shall have the
respective meanings set forth in the Feeder Fund's Registration Statement.
�
ITEM 3.����������������������FEE TABLE.
�
This table describes the fees and expenses that you will pay if you buy and hold limited liability company interests ("Interests") in the Master Fund.��Because the Master Fund has no operating history, many of these expenses are estimates.
�




 Management Fee(1)�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 


 1.20% 



 Other Expenses�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 


 0.55% 



 Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses(2)�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 


 1.33% 


 �  
 �  


 Total Annual Expenses(3)�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 


 3.08% 


 �  
�


�




� ����


 (1) 


 The Management Fee is payable by the Master Fund, but will be borne indirectly by Investors as a result of the Feeder Fund's investment in the Master Fund.��The Master Fund will pay the Adviser the Management Fee�at�the annual rate of 1.20% of the Master Fund's net asset value.��For purposes of determining the Management Fee payable to the Adviser for any quarter, net asset value will be calculated prior to any reduction for any fees and expenses of the Master Fund, including, without limitation, the Management Fee payable to the Adviser. 


 � 
 � 


 (2) 


 Includes the fees and expenses of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund intends to invest based upon estimated net assets of the Master Fund of $300 million.��Some or all of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund intends to invest charge carried interests, incentive fees or allocations based on the Investment Funds' performance.��The Investment Funds in which the Master Fund intends to invest generally charge a management fee of 1.00% to 1.75%, and approximately 20% of net profits as a carried interest allocation, subject to�a clawback.��The "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" disclosed above are based on historic returns of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund�anticipates investing, which may change substantially over time and, therefore, significantly affect "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses."��The�1.33% shown as "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" reflects operating expenses of the Investment
Funds (i.e., management fees, administration fees and professional and other direct, fixed fees and expenses of the Investment Funds).��The�"Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" disclosed above, however, do not reflect any performance-based fees or allocations paid by the Investment Funds that are calculated solely on the realization and/or distribution of gains, or on the sum of such gains and unrealized appreciation of assets distributed in-kind, as such fees and allocations for a particular period may be unrelated to the cost of investing in the Investment Funds.

 The Adviser has entered into an "Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement" with the Feeder Fund for a one-year term beginning with the commencement of operations (the "Initial Closing Date") and ending on the one year anniversary thereof (the "Limitation Period") to limit the amount of "Specified Expenses" (as described below) borne by the Feeder Fund (whether borne directly or indirectly through and in proportion to, the Feeder Fund's interest in the Master Fund) during the Limitation Period to an amount not to exceed 0.75% per annum of the Feeder Fund's net assets (the "Expense Cap").��"Specified Expenses" is defined to include all expenses incurred in the business of the Feeder Fund, provided that the following expenses are excluded from the definition of Specified Expenses:��(i) the Feeder Fund's proportional share of (a) the Management Fee, (b) fees, expenses, allocations,
carried interests, etc. of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund invests, (c) transaction costs of the Master Fund associated with the acquisition and disposition of secondary interests, (d) interest payments incurred by the Master Fund, (e) fees and expenses incurred in connection with a credit facility, if any, obtained by the Master Fund and (f) extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole discretion of the Adviser) of the Master Fund; and (ii) (a) the Sub-Placement Agent Fee, (b) interest payments incurred by the Feeder Fund, (c) fees and expenses incurred in connection with a credit facility, if any, obtained by the Feeder Fund, (d) taxes and (e) extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole discretion of the Adviser) of the Feeder Fund.��These expenses will be in addition to the expenses of the Feeder Fund that may be limited by the Adviser to 0.75% of the Feeder Fund's net assets.��To the extent that the Adviser bears Specified Expenses, it is
permitted to receive reimbursement for any expense amounts previously paid or borne by the Adviser, for a period not to exceed three years from the date on which such expenses were paid or borne by the Adviser, even if such reimbursement occurs after the termination of the Limitation Period, provided that the Specified Expenses have fallen to a level below the Expense Cap and the reimbursement amount does not raise the level of Specified Expenses in the month the reimbursement is being made to a level that exceeds the Expense Cap.

ITEM 10.�������������������� CAPITAL STOCK, LONG-TERM DEBT, AND OTHER SECURITIES.

�

ITEM 10.1.���������������� CAPITAL STOCK.
�
 The Master Fund is organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware and intends to be classified as a partnership for income tax purposes.��The rights of each Member in the Master Fund will be established and governed by the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Master Fund, dated and effective as of December 14, 2012 (the "LLC Agreement").��A Member and its advisers should carefully review the LLC Agreement, as each Member will agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.��The following is a summary description of certain provisions of the LLC Agreement.��The description of such provisions is not definitive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the LLC Agreement.��For purposes of this Item 10.1, capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings set forth in the LLC Agreement.��Reference should be
made to the complete text of the LLC Agreement. 

�
 Management and control of the business of the Master Fund is vested in its Board of Directors (the "Board"), which shall have the right, power and authority, on behalf of the Master Fund and in its name, to exercise all rights, powers and authority of "managers" under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "Delaware Act") and to do all things necessary and proper to carry out the objective and business of the Master Fund and its duties hereunder.��No Director shall have the authority individually to act on behalf of or to bind the Master Fund except within the scope of such Director's authority as delegated by the Board.��Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in the LLC Agreement, (i) each Director shall be vested with the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Master Fund as are customarily vested in each director of a Delaware corporation and (ii) each Independent
Director shall be vested with the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Master Fund as are customarily vested in each Director of a closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act that is organized as a Delaware corporation who is not an "interested person" of such company as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. During any period in which the Master Fund shall have no Directors, the Adviser shall continue to serve as investment adviser to the Master Fund and shall have the authority to manage the business and affairs of the Master Fund, but only until such time as one or more Directors are elected by the Members or the Master Fund is dissolved in accordance with Section 6.1 of the LLC Agreement. 
�
Each Member agrees not to treat, on his personal return or in any claim for a refund, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Master Fund.��The Board shall have the exclusive authority and discretion to make any elections required or permitted to be made by the Master Fund under any provisions of the Code or any other revenue laws.
�
Members shall have no right to participate in and shall take no part in the management or control of the Master Fund's business and shall have no right, power or authority to act for or bind the Master Fund.��Members shall have the right to vote on any matters only as provided in the LLC Agreement or on any matters that require the approval of the holders of voting securities under the Investment Company Act or as otherwise required in the Delaware Act.
�
The Board may delegate to any person any rights, power and authority vested by the LLC Agreement in the Board to the extent permissible under applicable law.
�
Actions requiring the vote of the Members may be taken at any duly constituted meeting of the Members at which a quorum is present.��Meetings of the Members may be called by the Board or by Members holding a majority of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by all Members, and may be held at such time, date and place as the Board shall determine.��The Board shall arrange to provide written notice of the meeting, stating the date, time and place of the meeting and the record date therefor, to each Member entitled to vote at the meeting within a reasonable time prior thereto.��Failure to receive notice of a meeting on the part of any Member shall not affect the validity of any act or proceeding of the meeting, so long as a quorum shall be present at the meeting.��Only matters set forth in the notice of a meeting may be voted on by the Members at a meeting.��The presence in person or by proxy of Members holding one-third
of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by all Members as of the record date shall constitute a quorum at any meeting.��In the absence of a quorum, a meeting of the Members may be adjourned by action of a majority of the Members present in person or by proxy without additional notice to the Members.��Except as otherwise required by any provision of the LLC Agreement or of the 1940 Act, (i) those candidates receiving a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of Members shall be elected as Directors, and (ii) all other actions of the Members taken at a meeting shall require the affirmative vote of Members holding a majority of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by those Members who are present in person or by proxy at such meeting.
�
Each Member shall be entitled to cast at any meeting of Members a number of votes equivalent to such Member's Voting Interest.��The Board shall establish a record date not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the date of any meeting of Members to determine eligibility to vote at such meeting and the number of votes which each Member will be entitled to cast thereat, and shall maintain for each such record date a list setting forth the name of each Member and the number of votes that each Member will be entitled to cast at the meeting.
�
A Member may vote at any meeting of Members by a proxy properly executed in writing by the Member and filed with the Master Fund before or at the time of the meeting.��A proxy may be suspended or revoked, as the case may be, by the Member executing the proxy by a later writing delivered to the Master Fund at any time prior to exercise of the proxy or if the Member executing the proxy shall be present at the meeting and decide to vote in person.��Any action of the Members that is permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Members may be taken without a meeting if consents in writing, setting forth the action taken, are signed by Members holding a majority of the total number of votes eligible to be cast or such greater percentage as may be required in order to approve such action.
�
Except as otherwise provided in the LLC Agreement, no Member or other person holding an Interest or portion thereof acquired from a Member has the right to withdraw from the Master Fund or require the Master Fund to redeem or repurchase its Interest or any portion thereof.��The Board may, from time to time and in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may determine, cause the Master Fund to offer to repurchase Interests or portions thereof from Members, including the Adviser or any of its affiliates, pursuant to written tenders.��In determining whether the Master Fund should offer to repurchase Interests or portions thereof from Members pursuant to written requests, the Board may consider the following factors, among others:
�




� 


(1)


whether any Members have requested to tender Interests or portions thereof to the Master Fund;



�




� 


(2)


the liquidity of the Master Fund's assets (including fees and costs associated with disposing of its interests in underlying Investment Funds);



�




� 


(3)


the investment plans and working capital requirements of the Master Fund;



�




� 


(4)


the relative economies of scale of the tenders with respect to the size of the Master Fund;



�




� 


(5)


the history of the Master Fund in repurchasing Interests or portions thereof;



�




� 


(6)


the availability of information as to the value of the Master Fund's investments in underlying Investment Funds;



�




� 


(7)


the existing conditions of the securities markets and the economy generally, as well as political, national or international developments or current affairs;



�




� 


(8)


the anticipated tax consequences of any proposed repurchases of Interests or portions thereof; and



�




� 


(9)


the recommendations of the Adviser.



�
The Board shall cause the Master Fund to repurchase Interests or portions thereof pursuant to written tenders only on terms fair to the Master Fund and to all Members (including persons holding Interests acquired from Members), as applicable.
�
The Board may cause the Master Fund to repurchase Interests or portions of a Member or any person acquiring an Interest or portion thereof from or through a Member if the Board determines or has reason to believe that:
�




� 


 (1) 


 such an Interest or portion thereof has been transferred in violation of Section 4.4 of the LLC Agreement, or such an Interest or portion thereof has vested in any person by operation of law as the result of the death, dissolution, bankruptcy or incompetency of a Member; 



�




� 


(2)


if any transferee does not meet any investor eligibility requirements established by the Master Fund from time to time;



�




� 


(3)


ownership of such an Interest or portion thereof by a Member or other person will cause the Master Fund to be in violation of, or require registration of any Interest or portion thereof under, or subject the Master Fund to additional registration or regulation under, the securities, commodities or other laws of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction;



�




� 


(4)


continued ownership of such an Interest or portion thereof may be harmful or injurious to the business or reputation of the Master Fund, the Adviser or the Board, or may subject the Master Fund or any of the Members to an undue risk of adverse tax or other fiscal consequences;



�




� 


(5)


any of the representations and warranties made by a Member in connection with the acquisition of an Interest or portion thereof was not true when made or has ceased to be true;



�




� 


(6)


with respect to a Member subject to special laws or regulations, the Member is likely to be subject to additional regulatory or compliance requirements under these special laws or regulations by virtue of continuing to hold an Interest or portion thereof;



�




� 


(7)


the account balance of the Member falls below $25,000; or



�




� 


(8)


it would be in the interests of the Master Fund, as determined by the Board, for the Master Fund to repurchase an Interest or a portion thereof.



�
Repurchases of Interests or portions thereof by the Master Fund shall be payable in non-interest bearing promissory notes, unless the Board, in its discretion, determines otherwise, or, in the discretion of the Board, in Securities (or any combination of Securities and cash) of equivalent value.��All such repurchases shall be subject to any and all conditions as the Board may impose and shall be effective as of a date set by the Board after receipt by the Master Fund of all eligible written tenders of Interests or portions thereof.��The amount due to any Member whose Interest or portion thereof is repurchased shall be equal to the net asset value of such Member's Capital Account or portion thereof as applicable as of the effective date of repurchase, after giving effect to all allocations to be made to such Member's Capital Account as of such date.
�
The Master Fund shall be dissolved at any time there are no Members, unless the Master Fund is continued in accordance with the Delaware Act, or upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
�




� 


(1)


upon the affirmative vote to dissolve the Master Fund by the Board;



�




� 


(2)


upon the determination of the Members not to continue the business of the Master Fund at a meeting called by the Adviser in accordance with Section [2.6(c)] of the LLC Agreement when no Director remains to continue the business of the Master Fund or if the required number of Directors is not elected within 60 days after the date on which the last Director ceased to act in that capacity;



�




� 


(3)


at the election of the Adviser to dissolve the Master Fund; or



�




� 


(4)


as required by operation of law.



�

 Subject to applicable law, if, at any time after the first two full years of the Master Fund's operations, a Member submits to the Master Fund a written request to commence a repurchase offer and the Master Fund does not, within two years from the date of such written request, commence a repurchase offer for at least 5% of the net assets of the Master Fund, the Master Fund promptly will thereafter offer to all then Members the opportunity to remain in the Master Fund or elect to contribute all or any portion of their Interests to a special purpose vehicle (an "SPV") that will seek to liquidate at least 90% of its assets within three full fiscal years of such contribution.��Any such SPV will not bear any investment advisory or investment management fees after the three fiscal year period. 
�

 Except as provided above, Members shall not have the authority, by vote or otherwise, to dissolve or cause the dissolution of the Master Fund.��Dissolution of the Master Fund shall be effective on the day on which the event giving rise to the dissolution shall occur, but the Master Fund shall not terminate until the assets of the Master Fund have been liquidated in accordance with Section 6.2 of the LLC Agreement and the Certificate has been canceled. 
�
 Upon the dissolution of the Master Fund as provided in Section 6.1 of the LLC Agreement, the Board, acting directly or through a liquidator it selects, shall liquidate, in an orderly manner, the business and administrative affairs of the Master Fund, except that if the Board is unable to perform this function, a liquidator elected by Members holding a majority of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by all Members shall liquidate, in an orderly manner, the business and administrative affairs of the Master Fund.��Net Profit and Net Loss during the period of liquidation shall be allocated pursuant to Article V of the LLC Agreement.��The proceeds from liquidation shall, subject to the Delaware Act, be distributed in the following manner: 
�




� 


(1)


in satisfaction (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof) of the debts and liabilities of the Master Fund, including the expenses of liquidation (including legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection therewith), but not including debt and liabilities to Members, up to and including the date that distribution of the Master Fund's assets to the Members has been completed, shall first be paid on a pro rata basis;



�




� 


(2)


such debts, liabilities or obligations as are owing to the Members shall be paid next in their order of seniority and on a pro rata basis; and



�




 �  


 ( 3) 


 the Members shall be paid next on a pro rata basis the positive balances of their respective Capital Accounts after giving effect to all allocations to be made to such Members' Capital Accounts for the accounting period ending on the date of the distributions under Section 6.2(a)(3) of the LLC Agreement. 



�
 Anything in Section 6.2 of the LLC Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, but subject to the priorities set forth in Section 6.2(a) of the LLC Agreement (described above), upon dissolution of the Master Fund, the Board or other liquidator may distribute ratably in kind any assets of the Master Fund; provided, however, that if any in-kind distribution is to be made (i) the assets distributed in kind shall be valued pursuant to Section 7.3 of the LLC Agreement as of the actual date of their distribution and charged as so valued and distributed against amounts to be paid under Section 6.2(a) of the LLC Agreement (described above), and (ii) any profit or loss attributable to property distributed in-kind shall be included in the Net Profit or Net Loss for the Fiscal Period ending on the date of such distribution. 
�

 Except as otherwise provided under applicable law, none of the Members, Directors, nor, except to the extent provided in Section 3.7 of the LLC Agreement and in the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser shall be liable personally for the Master Fund's debts, obligations or liabilities, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member or manager of the Master Fund, except that a Member may be obligated to make capital contributions to the Master Fund and other payments pursuant to the LLC Agreement and to repay any funds wrongfully distributed to such Member.��Notwithstanding any other provision of the LLC Agreement, the Adviser, in the exercise of its functions on behalf of the Master Fund, may require a Member to contribute to the Master Fund, at any time or from time to time, whether
before or after the dissolution of the Master Fund or after such Member ceases to be a member of the Master Fund, such amounts as the Adviser, in its discretion, determines are necessary to meet the Master Fund's debts, obligations or liabilities (not to exceed for any Member the aggregate amount of any distributions, amounts paid in connection with a repurchase of such Member's Interest and any other amounts received by such Member from the Master Fund during or after the Fiscal Year in which any debt, obligation or liability of the Master Fund arose or was incurred); provided however, that each Member shall contribute only his pro rata share of the aggregate amount requested based on such Member's Capital Account in the Fiscal Year in which the debt, obligation or liability arose or was incurred as a percentage of the aggregate Capital Accounts of all Members of the Master Fund in such Fiscal Year; and provided
further that the provisions of Section 2.10 of the LLC Agreement shall not affect the obligations of Members under the Delaware Act.
