Scott Copeland Talent Talent Agency Service Review from Bend, Oregon




                                    Paid the $1500 for my daughter as a retainer. We got NOTHING! He is a TOTAL scam... She only saw him a few times, all he could tell her is get down to a size 26. She's a tall larger bone young girl and he knew this was not possible, Scott took complete advantage of her...

Scott Copeland Talent - Loss of $1,500 retainer fee 




                                    My child is a minor and was approached in a mall by one of Copeland's young scouts.  Not knowing anything about the business my husband handed over the $1,500 and paid $800 for over the computer lessons.  When we stopped the lessons we were told it was a shame because...

Scott Copeland Talent




                                    I currently referred a model to Scott Copeland who is becoming very successful. If you do what Scott says and don't gain weight, Scott will introduce you to his top clients. A lot of his talent has become very successful. And it's not about money with Scott. Rather...

Scott Copeland Talent Scam




                                    Scott Copeland told me he would be able to book me work for his talent agency. Instead, he charged me a $1500 retainer fee that he would never actually refund to me. I had to pay an additional $1000 for two photo-shoots and a few hundred for comp cards. After spending...

If you don't find an answer to your question, please contact us so we can help you. 
Click on the links below to view answers:











How can you tell if a scroll is running backwards?

 

Three phase scrolls can rotate in either direction depending on how it is wired. If running in reverse rotation the compressor will have elevated sound levels, reduced current draw and suction pressures will not drop along with a non rise in discharge pressure. The compressor will eventually trip on motor protector.



Where do I find what the approved refrigerants are for compressors?

 

Compressor refrigerant ratings are based on engineering design, displacement and motor specifications. These and other factors are used to determine the refrigerant type and application. This information is found using the Online Product Information section of our website, or by contacting your nearest Authorized Emerson Wholesaler.



How can the BTU rating of a compressor be determined?

 

Capacity ratings for Copeland® compressors are found on our published performance curves. These curves can be obtained through our wholesalers or from the Online Product Information section of our website. To use these curves, convert the measured suction and discharge pressure readings to their corresponding evaporating and condensing temperatures using a pressure/temperature chart for the refrigerant being used. Plotting those temperatures on the performance curve tables will reveal the BTU/H ratings, amperage, and watts.



What is the recommended super heat of Copeland® compressors?

 

To insure proper compressor cooling and lubrication the minimum operating compressor superheat is 20 0F.



What is the discharge temperature limit of Copeland® compressors?

 

Typically the maximum DLT is 225 0F. However, this temperature can vary depending on specific applications.



How do you check oil pressure on a semi-hermetic compressor?

 

Net oil pressure is found by subtracting the crankcase pressure from the pressure measured at the oil pump outlet.



Can I mix Polyol Ester (POE) and Mineral Oil (MO) together?

 

When using CFC or HCHC refrigerants, POE and MO can be mixed. The exception is R12 that only uses MO or Alkyl Benzene Mineral Oil (ABMO) blend. HFC refrigerants can only use POE oil.



Where do I find what contactor a compressor takes?

 

Contactors can be found in the Application Bulletin 10-1244. These bulletins can be located using the Online Product Information section of our website, or by contacting your local Authorized Emerson Wholesaler.



Where can I find what starting components a compressor takes?

 

The best place to see what starting components a compressor takes is on this website under Online Produce Information. Other sources include the Emerson Climate Technologies, Inc. Electrical Handbook and product information sheet, however use caution on when referring to the product information sheets as these may be out dated and contain obsolete information.



What is the viscosity of POE oil?

 

The viscosity of oils used in Copeland® compressors is selected by design of the compressors and varies from 22 to 32 (centistokes). Refer to Emerson publication No. 93-11-R12 for further details.



Does Emerson have published Cross Reference Information?

 

Yes. To cross an obsolete compressor or unit to what supersedes it, or to cross a competitor to a Copeland® compressor, log into the Online Product Information section of our website and look under Supersession.



Where do I find the bolt torque specifications for Copelametic compressors?

 

Bolt torque specifications for Copelametic compressors can be found in the Application Bulletins, 4-1219. These bulletins are located using the Online Product Information section of our website, or by contacting your local Authorized Emerson Wholesaler.



Can I add an additive to the oil in a system?

 

No. Additives are not permitted. Refer to Application Bulletin 17-1282.



How can I determine the type and quantity of oil in a compressor?

 

This information can be found on the compressor nameplate. The oil type will be abbreviated, for example MIN, meaning mineral oil or POE, meaning polyol ester oil. The oil amount is the number found beneath the oil type and is a unit measure of fluid ounces (US). So if it says 265, which means 265 fluid ounces.



Are laser and delta reed valve plate kits interchangeable?

 

Due to engineering design differences of the compressor bodies and valve methods, valve plate kits are not interchangeable.
