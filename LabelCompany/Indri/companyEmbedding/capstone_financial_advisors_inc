1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Risk Management & Asset Protection


Mitigating risk is an important part of a wealth management strategy. We offer a full array of risk management services, which include advice on property and casualty insurance, and asset protection structures.
Limiting the exposure of personal assets from risks associated with your professional or business interests is vital to safeguarding against litigation. These strategies can be as simple as obtaining an appropriate amount of liability insurance, or as complex as creating trusts that make it more difficult for a creditor to discover and seize your assets. Regardless of the strategy, you can take comfort in knowing that Capstone will go the distance to protect the assets you have worked hard to build, and will recommend strategies that are in the best interest of you and your family. Services offered include:

Coverage analysis
Liability exposure management
Facilitation and recommendation of property and casualty coverage
Recommendations for personal insurance, including life, health, long-term care and disability

Investment Strategies


  


Equity Strategies


Global Equity IncomeLarge Cap Core GrowthTheta/Growth




Generate current income and long-term growth of capital.


Capstone’s Global Equity Income strategy pursues its objective through investment in U.S. and non-U.S. dividend paying stocks that have demonstrated above-median yield, increasing dividends, and favorable earnings growth. We invest in the common stocks of companies that represent a broad spectrum of the global economy. Although the strategy invests primarily in large-cap stocks, it is also able to invest in mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The non-U.S. investments are primarily in the form of depositary receipts which are U.S. dollar-denominated instruments representing securities of non-U.S. issuers that are traded in the U.S. The primary benchmark for the strategy is the S&P Global 1200 Index. The secondary benchmark is the S&P 500 Index.





Brochure




Performance & Characteristics




Commentary







Consistently provide above average, long-term growth with controlled risk through the management of diversified growth-oriented portfolios.


Capstone’s Large Cap Core Growth Equity Portfolio offers investors a separately managed account consisting of high quality, large capitalization growth stocks. We believe that our disciplined, bottom-up approach, which combines objective, quantitative analysis with subjective stock evaluation, will provide above average long-term growth in our clients’ portfolios, while at the same time explicitly controlling for portfolio risk. This universe is screened using several measures which fall under five basic criteria as follows: free cash flow, rising earnings estimates, quality of earnings, relative strength and stock valuation. The benchmark is the Russell 1000 Growth Index.





Brochure




Performance & Characteristics




Commentary







Provide income and capital appreciation with less volatility than the stock market.


A “buy-write” strategy, also called a “covered call,” is an investment strategy in which the investor buys a stock or a basket of stocks and writes (or sells) call options that cover the stock position. The strategy can enhance portfolio returns under certain market conditions and reduce volatility. In down markets, the option premium received cushions the price decline in an equity portfolio. The trade-off is that in strong equity markets, the upside potential of the equity investment is limited. Capstone’s “Theta/Growth” strategy provides investors with equity market participation while enhancing income potential and reducing risk. This approach is appropriate for investors looking for capital appreciation, higher yields, and reduced risk levels.

Fixed Income Strategies


Taxable Fixed IncomeIntermediate Fixed IncomeCurrent Income PortfolioMunicipal Fixed Income




Provide income and capital appreciation together with capital preservation through the management of high-quality domestic bonds.


Capstone’s Fixed Income Portfolios offer investors a separately managed account consisting primarily of intermediate-maturity, government, agency, and corporate bonds. We base our fixed-income approach on the belief that superior long-term returns can be achieved with less-than-market risk by focusing on high quality securities, and by adding value through active duration management and the selective rotation of market sectors and the securities within those sectors.





Brochure




Performance & Characteristics




Commentary





Provide capital preservation, current income, and capital appreciation.


This style is less interest-rate sensitive and less volatile than the fixed income market and allocates assets to U.S. Treasuries, Agencies, Investment Grade Corporates, and Mortgage-Backed bonds that are less than 10-year maturities.




Brochure




Performance & Characteristics




Commentary







Optimize a multi-sector fixed income portfolio for income.


Clients invest in an investment grade fixed income vehicle seeking the highest possible levels of interest and dividend income, while maintaining a conservative intermediate duration. Capstone designs CIP Portfolios for investors primarily seeking the highest possible absolute returns associated with liquid, intermediate-term, U.S. Fixed Income Securities.





Brochure




Performance & Characteristics




Commentary





Maximize after-tax income and preserve capital. Capstone seeks to reduce risk levels in portfolios by managing duration and investing in tax-free securities with ratings of “A” and higher.


Capstone’s municipal bond investment philosophy is to structure a portfolio consisting of “A” or higher rated bonds (at time of purchase) as rated by either Moody’s or S&P. Our municipal bond investments focus on essential services and general obligations with short- to intermediate-term maturity and duration currently less than the Barclays Quality Intermediate Municipal Bond Index. By emphasizing bond characteristics and overall structure, we attempt to maximize the portfolio’s current (coupon) income and taxable equivalent yields. Capstone’s access to institutional market relationships provides an opportunity to select from a diverse inventory of municipal bonds at competitive prices, enabling us to efficiently manage portfolios.

Performance & Characteristics




Commentary







 


Balanced Accounts


Balanced Core


Provide long-term growth and current income with controlled risk through the management of primarily intermediate-duration bonds and growth-oriented stocks.


Capstone’s Balanced Core Portfolio combines Large Capitalization Core Growth with Fixed Income. This strategy seeks to provide a balance of growth and income. The allocation ranges between 40% and 60% stocks and bonds and can be customized to fit individual needs.

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.
3The RIABiz listing of the 10 most influential figures in the Registered Investment Advisor industry is in recognition of notable, driven and influential executives who are advancing their firms and are considered to be influential in the RIA business. Investor experience/returns were not considered as part of this ranking.
4Presented by the International Association of Registered Financial Consultants (IARFC). Candidates must hold a professional designation and must have disseminated their comments on financial topics by having them widely published in articles, journals, books, etc. They must have provided outstanding personal service or leadership in the financial services industry. Nominees must have participated in some aspect of financial education to the public or to other members of the profession. Investor experience/returns were not considered.

	  Take charge of your financial life today.

	  
Managing your money is like anything else that you want to do well. It takes practice, patience—and most of all—a plan to do it right.
That’s why advice from a Financial Professional can help you organize all of your finances—everyday spending, investments, retirement accounts, college savings, insurance and more. So you can feel more prepared for whatever might happen, both today and tomorrow.
Getting started may feel challenging. But with our help and a financial plan to guide you, you can soon feel more confident about the road ahead.

Right onthe Money!
Nice work—you’ve created the same budget that Financial Professionals recommend, balancing todayʼs needs and wants with tomorrowʼs goals. Ready to learn even more about making the most of your financial life?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
