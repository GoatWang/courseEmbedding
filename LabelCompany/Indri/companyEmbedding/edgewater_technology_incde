	Edgewater Reports First Quarter 2017 Results







	WAKEFIELD, Mass., May 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edgewater Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:EDGW), a leading consulting firm that helps business leaders drive transformational change through its unique selection of business and technology services and specialized product-based solutions, reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.




	First Quarter 2017 Financial Results vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter




	Total revenue was $29.1 million compared to $31.9 million


	Service revenue was $25.1 million compared to $28.2 million


	Gross profit was $10.0 million, or 34.3% of total revenue, compared to $10.8 million, or 33.7% of total revenue


	Gross profit margin related to service revenue was 35.2% compared to 35.4%


	Utilization was 74.3% compared to 72.7%


	Net loss of $(2.7) million, or $(0.21) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $(763,000), or $(0.06) per diluted share


	Cash flow used in operating activities was $3.7 million compared to cash flow used in operating activities of $5.2 million; and


	Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $313,000, or 1.1% of total revenue (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term), compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million, or 4.3% of total revenue.




	Management Commentary



	“Over the past several weeks, we have begun the process of analyzing and modeling the intrinsic value of the Company and its operating units,” commented Jeffrey Rutherford, Edgewater’s chairman, interim president and interim CEO. “We are excited about the value creation potential of each of the Company’s three service offerings. 


	“As we move forward, we are completely focused on our efforts to drive shareholder value.  Through the strategic investment in sales and marketing and the elimination of unnecessary general and administrative spending, along with continued focus on consultant utilization, we have a clear and executable plan for the enhancement of shareholder value.


	“In terms of pure operational performance, excluding non-routine charges, the first quarter results were in-line with our expectations.  Service revenue was within our guidance range, and we increased sales and marketing efforts and spend rates to address the disruption in our sales pipeline activity associated with a vendor push to accelerate the adoption of new cloud-based applications.


	 “We anticipate second quarter 2017 service revenue will be in the range of $25.0 million to $26.0 million.  This will be essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2017 and down on a year-over-year basis.  Our second quarter 2017 service revenue projection continues to reflect the disruption we are experiencing from customers contemplating their adoption strategy for could-based applications.”

	Forward-Looking Statements



	This Press Release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements concerning our expected second quarter 2017 service revenue, the intrinsic value of the Company and its operating units, the value creation potential of each of the Company’s three service offerings, our ability to drive shareholder value and our ability to successfully execute a plan for the enhancement of shareholder value.  Forward-looking statements inherently involve certain risks and uncertainties, although they are based on our current plans or assessments which are believed to be reasonable as of the date of this Press Release. Factors that may cause actual results, goals, targets or objectives to differ materially from those contemplated, projected, forecasted, estimated, anticipated, planned or budgeted in such forward-looking statements include, among others, the following possibilities: (1) failure to obtain new customers or retain significant existing customers; (2) the loss of one or more key executives and/or employees; (3) changes in industry trends, such as a decline in the demand for Enterprise Resource Planning and Enterprise Performance Management solutions, custom development and system integration services and/or declines in industry-wide information technology spending, whether on a temporary or permanent basis and/or delays by customers in initiating new projects or existing project milestones; (4) inability to execute upon growth objectives; (5) adverse developments and volatility involving geopolitical or technology market conditions; (6) unanticipated events or the occurrence of fluctuations or variability in the matters identified under “Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K; (7) delays in, or the failure of, our sales pipeline being converted to billable work and recorded as revenue; (8) termination by clients of their contracts with the Company or inability or unwillingness of clients to pay for the Company's services, which may impact the Company's accounting assumptions; (9) inability to recruit and retain professionals with the high level of information technology skills and experience needed to provide the Company's services; (10) failure to expand outsourcing services to generate additional revenue; (11) any changes in ownership of the Company or otherwise that would result in a limitation of the net operating loss carry forward under applicable tax laws; (12) the possibility that activist stockholders may wage proxy contests or gain representation on or control of the Board of Directors, causing disruption and/or uncertainty to the Company's business, customer relationships and employee retention; (13) the failure of the marketplace to embrace advisory and product-based consulting services; (14) difficulties and costs associated with transitioning to the cloud; (15) the inability to achieve the expected synergies from our 2015 acquisitions; and/or (16) changes in the Company's utilization levels.  In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors described above as well as the risks outlined under “Part I - Item IA. Risk Factors” in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2017. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated, projected, anticipated, planned or budgeted in any such forward-looking statements.


	Although the Company believes that the expectations in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, growth, earnings per share or achievements. However, neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Press Release to conform such statements to actual results.

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures



	Edgewater reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management believes, however, that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the Company’s business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results. Certain of the information set forth herein and certain of the information presented by the Company from time to time may constitute non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have presented herein a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. As noted below, the foregoing measures have limitations and do not serve as a substitute and should not be construed as a substitute for GAAP performance, but provide supplemental information concerning our performance that our investors and we find useful.


	Edgewater views Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue as important indicators of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA measures are important performance metrics because they facilitate the analysis of our results, exclusive of certain non-cash items, including items which do not directly correlate to our business operations. 


	The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them, are outlined below:



	Income tax provision

	. The exit of our former significant unrelated operations in 2000 and 2001 created significant net operating loss carry-forwards and deferred tax assets, and the tax provisions that we take under GAAP, for which there is no corresponding federal tax payment obligation for us, and the adjustments that we make to our deferred tax asset, based on the prospects and anticipated future profitability of our ongoing operations, can be significant and can obscure, either significantly, or in part, period-to-period changes in our core operating results.



	Depreciation and amortization

	. We incur expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets that is primarily related to the various acquisitions we have completed. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because the amortization of intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency, and is significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the individual acquisition transactions, which also vary substantially in frequency from period-to-period.



	Stock-based compensation expense

	. We incur stock-based compensation expense under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, “

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	.” We exclude this non-cash expense as we do not believe it is reflective of business performance. The nature of stock-based compensation expense also makes it very difficult to estimate prospectively, since the expense will vary with changes in the stock price and market conditions at the time of new grants, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and different award types, making the comparison of current results with forward-looking guidance potentially difficult for investors to interpret. Edgewater believes that non-GAAP financial measures of profitability, which exclude stock-based compensation, are widely used by analysts and investors.



	Adjustments to contingent consideration earned, at fair value

	. We are required to remeasure the fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions each reporting period until the contingency is settled. Any changes in fair value are recognized as a current period operating expense. The Company believes that excluding these adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because they are related to acquisition events and make it difficult to evaluate core operating results.



	Direct acquisition costs

	. We incur direct transaction costs related to acquisitions which are expensed in our GAAP financial statements. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effects of direct acquisition-related costs as we believe these transaction-specific expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and make it difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results.



	Consent solicitation expenses.

	  Consent solicitation expenses are expenses incurred to respond to activities and inquiries of Ancora Advisors LLC and Lone Star Value Management (“Lone Star”), including associated consent solicitations, and a subsequent settlement agreement with Lone Star. The Company has not incurred significant expenses in connection with such matters in historical periods, and these costs are not considered core operating activities. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these costs in order to provide investors with the ability to compare our period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.



	Other expense, net.

	We record periodic interest and other (income) and expense amounts in connection with our cash and cash equivalents, capital lease obligations, (gains) and losses on foreign currency transactions and the recognition of the recorded discount on accrued contingent earnout consideration. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude (income) expense associated with these items as we believe such (income) expense is inconsistent in amount and frequency and makes it difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results.



	Named executive officer severance

	. In March 2017, we incurred expense associated with the termination of employment of certain named executive officers of the Company.  Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the severance-related expense associated with the termination of these individuals as we believe that such expense is not consistent with the normally recurring operations of our Company and it makes it difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our operating performance.


	We believe that Adjusted EBITDA metrics provide qualitative insight into our current performance; we use these measures to evaluate our results, the performance of our management team and our management’s entitlement to incentive compensation; and we believe that making this information available to investors enables them to view our performance the way that we view our performance and thereby gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results, in general, and from period to period.

	Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue are Non-GAAP performance measures and are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP Net Income (Loss). Adjusted EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) less other expense, net, plus income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, adjustments to contingent consideration earned, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, direct acquisition costs, consent solicitation expenses and named executive officer severance. Adjusted EBITDA as a % of Total Revenue is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.




	Named executive officer severance excludes stock-based compensation expense associated with the acceleration of vesting provisions on certain equity awards as this expense is reported as a part of stock-based compensation expense.

	Significant Improvement in Key Operating Metrics




	WAKEFIELD, Mass., March 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edgewater Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:EDGW), a leading consulting firm that helps business leaders drive transformational change through its unique selection of business and technology services and specialized product-based solutions, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year periods ended December 31, 2016.




	Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter




	Total revenue was $29.8 million compared to $28.4 million;


	Service revenue was $25.6 million compared to $24.3 million;


	Gross profit was $12.0 million, or 40.2% of total revenue, compared to $9.8 million, or 34.4% of total revenue;


	Gross profit margin related to service revenue was 41.9% compared to 34.7%; 


	Utilization was 72.9% compared to 67.2%;


	Net loss was $(3.4) million, or $(0.28) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(4.6) million, or $(0.40) per diluted share.  Net loss during the fourth quarter of 2016 included a $3.5 million non-cash charge associated with an increase in the valuation allowance provided against the carrying value of our deferred tax attributes;


	Cash flow provided by operating activities was $5.4 million compared to $2.4 million; and


	Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $3.1 million, or 10.4% of total revenue (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term), compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million, or 5.7% of total revenue.




	Full Year 2016 Financial Results vs. Same Year-Ago Period




	Total revenue was $126.5 million compared to $116.7 million;


	Service revenue was $109.5 million compared to $98.8 million;


	Gross profit was $46.2 million, or 36.5% of total revenue, compared to $39.6 million, or 33.9% of total revenue;


	Gross profit margin related to service revenue was 38.3% compared to 35.0%; 


	Utilization was 73.5% compared to 69.5%;


	Net loss was $(2.8) million, or $(0.23) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(4.1) million, or $(0.35) per diluted share.  Net loss during 2016 included a $3.7 million non-cash charge associated with an increase in the valuation allowance provided against the carrying value of our deferred tax attributes;


	Cash flow provided by operating activities was $6.6 million compared to $3.3 million; and


	Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $9.9 million, or 7.8% of total revenue (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term), compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million, or 5.8% of total revenue.




	Management Commentary



	“In 2016, Edgewater posted 11% service revenue growth.  Furthermore, the Company achieved significantly improved gross margins, service revenue gross margins, utilization, and Adjusted EBITDA,” stated Shirley Singleton, Edgewater’s chairman, president and CEO.   “We made significant strides with respect to expanding our cloud revenue-based service offerings, with cloud-based service revenue representing 19% of our service revenue in 2016, as compared to 15% in 2015.


	“As we have previously discussed, solution providers, like Edgewater, are seeing a gap between the rise of cloud adoption and the sun-setting of legacy on premise applications.  There are noticeable differences in the approach to address this gap being taken by the two major channels we service.


	“We believe that Microsoft appears to be achieving a faster rate of cloud traction as they have taken a more holistic approach to moving their products to the cloud.  During the fourth quarter, Edgewater Fullscope reported strong cloud sales of Dynamics365.  We fully expect the majority of 2017 service revenue generated by this offering to be primarily cloud-based.


	“The Oracle channel still appears to have considerable activity in the on-premise arena.  Edgewater Ranzal has been working hard to adjust its sales and marketing strategies to accommodate Oracle’s slower and more methodical roll-out of cloud modules.  The acceleration of our cloud service revenue growth in the Oracle channel is highly dependent on the gradual availability of new cloud products and the customers’ desire to leverage their existing on premise software applications.


	“Our consulting practice continues to show acceleration in providing advisory services for digital transformation and the cloud.


	“We anticipate that service revenue will be in the range of $25.0 million to $26.0 million during the first quarter of 2017.   For the full year 2017, the Company is targeting low single-digit service revenue growth and doubling its cloud-based service revenue on a year-over-year basis.”

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures



	Edgewater reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management believes, however, that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the Company’s business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results. Certain of the information set forth herein and certain of the information presented by the Company from time to time may constitute non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have presented herein a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. As noted below, the foregoing measures have limitations and do not serve as a substitute and should not be construed as a substitute for GAAP performance, but provide supplemental information concerning our performance that our investors and we find useful.


	Edgewater views Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue as important indicators of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA measures are important performance metrics because they facilitate the analysis of our results, exclusive of certain non-cash items, including items which do not directly correlate to our business operations. 


	The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them, are outlined below:



	Income tax provision

	. The exit of our former significant unrelated operations in 2000 and 2001 created significant net operating loss carry-forwards and deferred tax assets, and the tax provisions that we take under GAAP, for which there is no corresponding federal tax payment obligation for us, and the adjustments that we make to our deferred tax asset, based on the prospects and anticipated future profitability of our ongoing operations, can be significant and can obscure, either significantly, or in part, period-to-period changes in our core operating results.



	Depreciation and amortization

	. We incur expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets that is primarily related to the various acquisitions we have completed. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because the amortization of intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency, and is significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the individual acquisition transactions, which also vary substantially in frequency from period-to-period.



	Stock-based compensation expense

	. We incur stock-based compensation expense under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, “

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	.” We exclude this non-cash expense as we do not believe it is reflective of business performance. The nature of stock-based compensation expense also makes it very difficult to estimate prospectively, since the expense will vary with changes in the stock price and market conditions at the time of new grants, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and different award types, making the comparison of current results with forward-looking guidance potentially difficult for investors to interpret. Edgewater believes that non-GAAP financial measures of profitability, which exclude stock-based compensation, are widely used by analysts and investors.



	Adjustments to contingent consideration earned, at fair value

	. We are required to remeasure the fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions each reporting period until the contingency is settled. Any changes in fair value are recognized as a current period operating expense. The Company believes that excluding these adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because they are related to acquisition events and make it difficult to evaluate core operating results.



	Direct acquisition costs

	. We incur direct transaction costs related to acquisitions which are expensed in our GAAP financial statements. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effects of direct acquisition-related costs as we believe these transaction-specific expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and make it difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results.



	Consent solicitation expenses.

	  Consent solicitation expenses are expenses incurred to respond to activities and inquiries of Ancora Advisors LLC and Lone Star Value Management (“Lone Star”), including associated consent solicitations, and a subsequent settlement agreement with Lone Star. The Company has not incurred significant expenses in connection with such matters in historical periods, and these costs are not considered core operating activities. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these costs in order to provide investors with the ability to compare our period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.



	Other expense, net.

	We record periodic interest and other (income) and expense amounts in connection with our cash and cash equivalents, capital lease obligations, (gains) and losses on foreign currency transactions and the recognition of the recorded discount on accrued contingent earnout consideration. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude (income) expense associated with these items as we believe such (income) expense is inconsistent in amount and frequency and makes it difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results.


	We believe that Adjusted EBITDA metrics provide qualitative insight into our current performance; we use these measures to evaluate our results, the performance of our management team and our management’s entitlement to incentive compensation; and we believe that making this information available to investors enables them to view our performance the way that we view our performance and thereby gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results, in general, and from period to period.

	Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue are Non-GAAP performance measures and are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP Net Income. Adjusted EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income less other expense, net, plus taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, adjustments to contingent consideration earned, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, direct acquisition costs and consent solicitation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA as a % of Total Revenue is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this annual report. This annual report may contain certain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Item 1A. - Risk Factors" and under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  Overview  Edgewater Technology, Inc. helps the C-suite drive transformational change through its unique selection of business and technology services and channel-based solutions.  Classic consulting disciplines (such as business advisory, process improvement, organizational change management, M&A due diligence, and domain expertise) are blended with technical services (such as digital transformation, technical roadmaps, data and analytics services, custom development and system integration) to help organizations leverage investments in legacy IT assets to create new digital business models.  The Company delivers product based consulting in both the Enterprise Performance Management ("EPM") and Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") areas both on premise and in the cloud. Within the EPM offering, our Oracle channel, Edgewater Ranzal provides Business Analytics solutions leveraging Oracle EPM, BI and Big Data technologies. Within the ERP offering, our Microsoft channel, Edgewater Fullscope delivers Dynamics AX ERP, Business Intelligence and CRM solutions primarily in the manufacturing space.  Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations  Revenue.  The Company derives its service revenue from time and materials-based contracts, fixed-price contracts and retainer-based arrangements. Time and materials-based contracts represented 84.0% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Fixed-price contracts represented 10.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue pursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. Retainer-based contracts represented 5.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue under retainer-based contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period, as outlined within the respective contract.  Provisions for estimated profits or losses on incomplete projects are made on a contract-by-contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such profits or losses are determined. The Company did not recognize any significant losses on contracts during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. On many projects, we are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses such as airfare, lodging and meals. These reimbursements are included as a component of revenue and cost of revenue. The aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers, the total number of our projects that require travel and whether our arrangements with our customers provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project-related expenses.  With the offering of a product-based consulting model, software revenue will continue to be a meaningful portion of our revenues. Software revenue, driven by resales of Microsoft Dynamics AX product, represented 8.3%, 9.3% and 7.2% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Software and maintenance revenue are recognized upon delivery, except in the infrequent situation where the Company provides maintenance services, in which case the related maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance  - 28 -  Table of Contents  period (while the software revenue is recognized upon delivery). Software revenue is expected to fluctuate between quarters, dependent on our customers' demand for such third-party off-the-shelf software. Fluctuations in software revenue may have an impact upon our periodic operating performance, including gross margin.  Operating Expenses.  The largest portion of our operating expenses consists of cash and non-cash compensation and benefits associated with our project consulting personnel and related expenses. Non-cash compensation includes share-based compensation expense arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees. Project personnel expenses also consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with our professional staff. Other related expenses include travel, subcontracting costs, third-party vendor payments and non-billable expenses associated with the delivery of services to our customers. We consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance. The relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base, the prices we charge our customers and the non-billable costs associated with securing new customer engagements and developing new service offerings. The remainder of our recurring operating expenses consists of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our customer-serving professionals, such as professional development and recruiting, marketing and sales, and management and administrative support. Professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training, content development and delivery costs. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs. Management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations, including finance, information systems, human resources, facilities (including the rent of office space) and other administrative support for project personnel.  The Company regularly reviews its fees for services, professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that its services and compensation are competitive within the industry and that its overhead costs are balanced with its revenue levels. In addition, we monitor the progress of customer projects with customer senior management. The Company manages the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements. However, a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned. In addition, because most of our customer engagements are terminable by our customers without penalty, an unanticipated termination of a customer project could require us to maintain underutilized employees. While professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements, the Company must also maintain a sufficient number of consulting professionals to oversee existing customer engagements and to participate in sales activities to secure new customer assignments.  Direct Acquisition Costs.  The Company incurred $430 thousand of direct acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which were related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of M2 Dynamics in the year ended December 31, 2015. Incurred expenses included investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting and other professional fees directly associated with completion of the acquisitions.  The Company incurred $1.8 million of direct acquisition costs related to the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of Zero2Ten, Branchbird and M2 Dynamics in the year ended December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company incurred approximately $613 thousand of direct acquisition costs associated with the March 13, 2015 Zero2Ten Acquisition. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company incurred approximately $340 thousand of direct acquisition costs associated with the August 17, 2015 Branchbird Acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company incurred approximately $801 thousand of direct acquisition costs associated with the December 21, 2015 M2 Dynamics Acquisition. Incurred expenses included investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting and other professional fees directly associated with completion of the acquisitions.  - 29 -  Table of Contents  Consent Solicitation Expense.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $187 thousand of legal and advisory expenses in connection with its defense against a consent solicitation. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred $495 thousand of legal and advisory expenses in connection with its defense against a consent solicitation. No such expenses were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014.  Adjustments to Fair Value of Contingent Consideration.  The Company remeasures the estimated carrying value of contingent consideration each quarter, with any changes (income or expense) in the estimated fair value recorded as an operating expense (classified as change in fair value of contingent earnout consideration). Accretion of the contingent earnout liability is classified as other expense on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $8.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively, accrued in connection with the contingent earnout obligations associated with the Zero2Ten, Branchbird, and M2 Dynamics Acquisitions. The decrease in accrued contingent earnout consideration is driven by the payment of $3.9 million related to the completion of the first Zero2Ten earnout period and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to fair value of the remaining liabilities, partially offset by accretion of the contingent liabilities.  Growth Through Acquisitions.  The Company's goal is to position itself as one of the leading providers of transformational classic and product-based consulting services in North America by growing its customer base, leveraging its industry expertise to enhance its service offerings and continuing to make disciplined strategic acquisitions. Previous acquisitions, including, but not limited to its acquisitions of Zero2Ten, Branchbird and M2 Dynamics, have further expanded its geographical footprint, increased its vertical expertise and provided more scale to our organization. The Company will continue to evaluate the possibility of growth through acquisition in future years.  Company Performance Measurement Systems and Metrics.  The Company's management monitors and assesses its operating performance by evaluating key metrics and indicators on an ongoing basis. For example, we regularly review performance information related to annualized revenue per billable consultant, periodic consultant utilization rates, gross profit margins, average bill rates and billable employee headcount. Edgewater has also developed internal Enterprise Performance Management systems which aid us in measuring our operating performance and consultant utilization rates. The matching of sales opportunities to available skill sets in our consultant base is one of our greatest challenges, and therefore, we monitor consultant utilization closely. These metrics, along with other operating and financial performance metrics, are used in evaluating management's overall performance. These metrics and indicators are discussed in more detail under "Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015," included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements may be affected. The accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:   Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets;   Revenue Recognition;  - 30 -  Table of Contents   Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets;   Purchase Price Allocation; and   Valuation of Contingent Earnout Consideration.  Senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. See "Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included elsewhere herein, which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP. We have identified the policies listed below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations.  Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.  In determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from different treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. In evaluating our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we must project future levels of taxable income. This assessment requires significant judgment. Recovery of the deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving such projections and failure to do so would result in an increase in the valuation allowance in a future period. We have net deferred tax assets that have arisen primarily as a result of timing differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. Our ability to realize a deferred tax asset is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. As is our practice, we assess, on a routine periodic basis, the estimated future realizability of the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis. Our periodic assessments take into consideration both positive evidence (future profitability projections for example) and negative evidence (historical cumulative loss position for example) as it relates to evaluating the future recoverability of our deferred tax assets.  As of December 31, 2016, the gross carrying value of the Company's net deferred tax assets was $27.2 million. This amount consisted of approximately $6.4 million in federal NOL carryforwards, $0.4 million in state NOL carryforwards, $1.1 million in available federal credits, $2.8 million in future tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense and $8.3 million in net deferred tax assets related to other temporary differences.  The Company maintained a $8.2 million and $4.5 million valuation allowance against the gross carrying value of its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, in connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated future realizability of our net deferred tax attributes, we recorded a non-cash tax charge of $3.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in connection with an increase to the previously established valuation allowance recorded against the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets.  The Company considers scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters, including the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable, in assessing the need for and the amount of the valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or we adjust these estimates in the future periods, further adjustments to our valuation allowance may be recorded, which could materially impact our financial position and net (loss) income in the period of the adjustment.  - 31 -  Table of Contents  Revenue Recognition.  Our Company recognizes revenue primarily through the provision of consulting services and the resale of third-party, off-the-shelf software and maintenance.  We recognize revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we enter into generally fall into three specific categories: time and materials, fixed-price and retainer. Time and materials-based contracts represented 84.0%, 82.3% and 90.2% of service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue related to our service offerings is recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. When a customer enters into a time and materials, fixed-price or a periodic retainer-based contract, we recognize revenue in accordance with our evaluation of the deliverables in each contract. If the deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we then measure and allocate the consideration from the arrangement to the separate units, based on reliable evidence of fair value for each deliverable.  Revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue pursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. Over the course of a fixed-price contract, we routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the proportional performance on our fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. This method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of costs and revenue earned can be made, based on historical experience and milestones identified in any particular contract. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion, revenue is recognized upon completion of performance, subject to any warranty provisions or other project management assessments as to the status of work performed.  If our initial estimates of the resources required or the scope of work to be performed on a fixed-price contract are inaccurate, or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period, a provision for estimated losses on incomplete projects is made. Any known or probable losses on projects are charged to operations in the period in which such losses are determined. A formal project review process takes place quarterly, although projects are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Management reviews the estimated total direct costs on each contract to determine if the estimated amounts are accurate, and estimates are adjusted as needed in the period revised estimates are made. No material losses were recognized on fixed-price contracts during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.  We also perform services on a periodic retainer basis under infrastructure service contracts, which include monthly hosting and support services. Revenue under periodic retainer-based contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period, as outlined within the respective contract. In the event additional services are required, above the minimum retained or contracted amount, then such services are billed on a time and materials basis.  Typically, the Company provides warranty services on its fixed-price contracts related to providing customers with the ability to have any "design flaws" remedied and/or have our Company "fix" routine defects. The warranty services, as outlined in the respective contracts, are provided for a specific period of time after a project is complete. The Company values the warranty services based upon historical labor hours incurred for similar services at standard billing rates. Revenue related to the warranty provisions within our fixed-price contracts is recognized as the services are performed or the revenue is earned. The warranty period is typically for a 30-60 day period after the project is complete.  We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We establish billing terms at the time at which the project deliverables and/or milestones are agreed. Our standard payment terms are 30 days from invoice date. Out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses charged to customers are reflected as revenue.  - 32 -  Table of Contents  Customer prepayments, even if nonrefundable, are deferred (classified as deferred revenue) and recognized over future periods as services are performed. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a deferred liability of approximately $349 thousand and $406 thousand, respectively, which is included in the financial statement caption of "deferred revenue" related to customer prepayments.  Software revenue represents the resale of certain third-party off-the-shelf software and related maintenance and is recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction, whereby we have credit risk and we set the price to the end user. In the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the software sale transaction and act as an agent, software revenue will be recorded on a net basis. Revenue from software resale arrangements represented 8.3%, 9.3% and 7.2% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The majority of the software sold by the Company is delivered electronically. For software that is delivered electronically, we consider delivery to have occurred when the customer either (a) takes possession of the software via a download (that is, when the customer takes possession of the electronic data on its hardware), or (b) has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware pursuant to an agreement or purchase order for the software.  The Company enters into multiple element arrangements which typically include software, post-contract support (or maintenance), and consulting services. Consistent with the software described above, maintenance that is in the form of a pass through transaction is recognized upon delivery of the software, as all related warranty and maintenance is performed by the primary software vendor and not the Company. Maintenance fee revenue for the Company's software products, which is inconsequential in all years presented, is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements, which are generally for a one-year period. The Company has established Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") with respect to the services provided, for which revenue is recognized as the services are performed.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable that have been deemed to have a high risk of collectability. Management reviews its accounts receivable balances on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables are potentially uncollectible. Management further analyzes historical collection trends and changes in its customer payment patterns, customer concentration and credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be potentially uncollectible, along with a general reserve, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts.  Billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue or bad debts as appropriate in the period the risk is identified.  Based on the information available, management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, future write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance.  Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  Business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually, on December 2, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We record intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition. Our intangible assets consist primarily of non-compete  - 33 -  Table of Contents  arrangements, customer relationships and trade names and trademarks. We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or based on estimated future cash flows to approximate the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset will be utilized.  Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing the "fair value" methodology. Factors the Company considers important that could trigger an interim review for impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:  ? Significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;  ? Significant changes in the manner of its use of acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business;  ? Significant negative industry or economic trends;  ? Significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period; and  ? Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two-step process. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit (the "First Step"). If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, a second step must be followed to calculate impairment (the "Second Step"). Otherwise, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date. In its review of the carrying value of the goodwill, the Company determines fair values for the reporting units using the Income Approach, or more specifically the Discounted Cash Flow Method, and the Market Approach, . . .

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
