  	   	          INNOCAP  					THIS GUY IS THE REAL DEAL!   					CLICK ANY PICTURE TO ENLARGE &  					SOME HAVE VIDEOS        					         CLICK PICTURE TO WATCH  					NAT-GEO SHOW ABOUT PAUL        					        INNOCAP, Inc. is a world class leader in deep ocean technology used to locate, salvage and bring historical impact from deep sea projects. With over 50 years of combined experience, the dynamic duel leadership of Paul Tidwell and Chris Dubea complement each other’s strengths to bring Innocap a broad spectrum of opportunity on the high seas. This company is built on the knowledge and experience to handle deep sea projects from conception to final market, with its leadership having accomplished the world’s deepest salvage dive as yet undertaken, going to 17,580 feet in the I-52 project. Innocap’s strategic plan, however, looks beyond a single event or discovery to the wealth of recovered gold and ceramic artifacts that have yet to be recovered.  						National governments have come to understand that it is in their interest to encourage investment in recovery by private companies. Changes in national laws regarding permits and recovery rights make artifact exploration much more profitable and secure from legal disputes in those countries. Individual artifact explorers have found significant items that they wish to sell but need a more experienced and knowledgeable entity to bring these items together in collections for sale. These items aggregate to significant artifact inventories for which Innocap will receive representational fees, combined with revenues from Innocap’s own recoveries of rare Ming and Song Dynasty and other rare porcelain items. An important Innocap planned project in this gameplan will be to assemble one the largest collections of recovered sunkentreasures for auction, sale and tour. This process will include a simultaneous on-site, television and internet treasure auction following a year-long tour. Innocap will be the lead company in this enterprise, with other partners participating under Innocap’s direction. Negotiations are well underway for the first of these big projects. 						   Finding “treasure” is only part of Innocap’s goal. Just as important are the revenues and notoriety that will come from the stories of the search and discovery. By unveiling the mystery of the “stories behind the treasure” and validating their legitimacy, Innocap will break new ground in providing unique, exciting digital and video products for the entertainment and educational markets. Multimedia programming and delivery is one of the most dynamic industries in the world. What began with television on three networks just a few years ago has become a 500 channel cable and satellite television business today. The Internet puts this on a global platform. The emphasis of the past decade has been on the creation, integration and standardization of hardware systems, both in terms of production hardware and delivery systems. In that race for dominance in the entertainment and educational world, Innocap, Inc. has as its core philosophy that the “value added” which brings high demand for recovered treasure and other artifacts is not just their rarity and intrinsic content value, but the allure which the story of the their loss and recovery brings to those who value this kind of investment. Thus, the “telling of the story” is an essential element in strategic product marketing. Fortunately, the story itself has worth of its own in this multimedia age and becomes a profit center for software and ancillary promotional products.
