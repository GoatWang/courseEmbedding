Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns.

We provide a full suite of business search and intelligence services that facilitate client investigations into personal property, company, individual verification, and commercial viability.

Why Us?


ASIC Reports
With our complete access to ASIC's databases, search a range of reports and documents relating to chosen companies, organisations and individuals.



Credit and Bankruptcy 
Uncover the financial track record, credit history and any unlawful activity of a particular company, vital in determining the viability of a potential business partner.



Business Names
This is your key to the Australian Business Register (ABR), where you can apply for a business name or renew an existing business name for one or three years.



Company Registration
This is your starting point in establishing a company – register it here with ASIC to receive a Certificate of Registration and an Australian Company Number (ACN).



Land Title Data
Through our partnership with national regulatory bodies, a catalogue of Land Title Data reports and documents are available for a number of Australian states.



 Police Background Checks
A criminal record may leave an applicant unsuitable or forbidden from a particular role. A Police Check returns a report containing an individual's personal and criminal history. 



Property Reports
A Property Report delivers a detailed analysis on a chosen property, providing specifications, sales history and price data – an ideal tool for property buyers.



Vehicle Reports
A Vehicle Report delivers a detailed analysis on a chosen vehicle, providing specifications, price data and vehicle history that may be withheld by the seller.



Domain Registration
Register a domain name with any extension (e.g .com.au, .net, .org) to ensure it belongs to you, preventing anybody else from securing the name.



Web Hosting
After registering a domain name, choose from a range of hosting options that suit your personal or business needs and establish your own website.



PropertyChecker
PropertyChecker helps you stay informed about a particular property to more accurately determine its true value to you. (Australian Patent 2014100449)



DIY Web Builder
Design your own fully functional and industry-specific website with this easy-to-use application that will complement your domain and hosting while saving time and money.
