            Robert Fagenson: Millionaire CEO Wins $65K In N.Y. Lottery                    
Jonathan Franks



Robert Fagenson was able to add another $65,000 to his income by simply being a winner in the state Lotto.
The New York Post reports that the Wall Street millionaire was able to win his “chump change” as a second-place prize in the state Lotto drawing that was conducted last week.
Out of the six Lotto numbers that were selected, according to the report, Robert Fagenson was able to hit five of them. The 66-year-old CEO was even able to hit the bonus number, which allowed him to rake in $65,243.
In an interview with the New York Post, Fagenson opened up about his lottery win and his reassurance of the state Lotto in general.
“I was just wondering if the system really worked. Now I know it actually works.”
For over 20 years, Robert Fagenson has maintained a consistent routine of playing the state lottery. Reports confirm that Robert uses the same numbers twice a week — a combination of his wife’s birthday, their wedding anniversary, and the birthdays of his two daughters.
Each year, Fagenson sends a check in the amount of $290 to the lottery in exchange for the chance to win big in the drawing.
That adds up to an estimated $5,800 that Fagenson has spent on the lottery over the past two decades alone. Based on that calculation, he was able to generate a major return on his long-term investment from a single win.
The New York Post reports that Robert Fagenson plans to keep playing the lotto each week. The fact that he was able to win $65,000 and hit five out of six numbers is probably all the motivation that he needs to do so.
However, the bigger picture of Fagenson’s finances shows why $65,000 might be considered “chump change” for him. According to the Wall Street Journal, Fagenson donated the same amount of money that he won from the state Lotto — $65,000 — to an animal charity based in Long Island back in 2011.
According to the Daily Mail, public records show that Fagenson also owns a Manhattan apartment that is worth approximately $2.8 million.
A native of New York, Fagenson graduated from Syracuse University over 40 years ago back in 1970.
The majority of his career thus far has been spent on the New York Stock Exchange. During his tenure with the NYSE, Fagenson served as a governor of the trading floor and also spent time serving on the board of directors.
Robert Fagenson is now the CEO of Fagenson and Co., a firm that has specialized in money management and investment brokerage for five decades.
