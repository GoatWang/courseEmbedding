First of all we are proud to present a new upcoming star � Peter Heding.Peter has been around for a few years now, but this spring he officially announced that he is making pipes full time.Peter has a PSD in diabetes and has been working full time with research and lab work in the medicinal industries. He has now quit his job to concentrate 100% on the pipes � call that dedication.Peter is a born natural talent when it comes to pipe making and we are sure he will do well in a world with Kent�s, Teddy�es and Tokutomi�s. We wish him all the luck.We actually got the first two pipes from his brand new workshop and if they set the standard, it�s looking very promising.
