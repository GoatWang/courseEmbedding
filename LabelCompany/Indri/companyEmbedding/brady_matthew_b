Salman Rushdie, in his novel  “The Ground Beneath Her Feet”  (1999), described what we see in a photograph as “a moral decision taken in one-eighth of a second.”In the early days of photography, those moral decisions took longer to process. When Mathew Brady, the Civil War-era photographer, took a portrait, the shutter remained open for 10 to 15 seconds or more, long enough for a bit of wind, or the hint of a smile, to ruin everything. His subjects often had their heads stabilized by an unseen vise.Brady (1823-96) was America’s first great portrait photographer, Richard Avedon and Annie Leibovitz rolled into one. Those long exposure times were a gift of sorts to a country that was still young. What Brady’s images lacked in spontaneity they more than made up for in gravitas. He defined a nation’s dignified visual sensibility.“Mathew Brady: Portraits of a Nation” is a new biography from Robert Wilson, the editor of The American Scholar. It’s a compact, straightforward, unblinking volume that has some of the attributes of its subject.If I sometimes wanted more expressiveness from it — if I wished it were a literary document as well as an historical one — well, you can’t have everything. The book is sober history, a flinty chunk of Americana.

Almost no one smiled in Brady’s photographs. Smiles are elusive, too hard then to bottle. One of the things Mr. Wilson makes plain about Brady, however, is that he himself had a terrific smile. In his presence, one observer said, you felt “the light of an Irish shower sun.” Continue reading the main story

Brady’s personal charm helped make him the favorite of presidents, generals, celebrities and royalty. He photographed Lincoln, Grant and Lee as well as Twain and Whitman and Dolley Madison and Daniel Webster. In the 1840s and 1850s, he set up a large gallery in downtown Manhattan. He was “Brady of Broadway.”

Not a lot is known about his early life. Brady was raised in upstate New York, near Lake George. His father was an Irish immigrant. Brady made it to Manhattan about the time the daguerreotype did. He manufactured leather cases for photographic equipment before going into the photography business himself. He opened his first studio in 1844.Anyone who has seen Ken Burns’s documentary “The Civil War” knows how beautifully he learned to pan across Brady’s photographs from that war, among the first in history to leave a detailed photographic record. The details of Brady’s war years are both funny and revealing about the age.He accompanied the Union Army to its first major battle, at Bull Run, and the experience scared him to death. He’d apparently shown up wearing a white linen duster, a straw hat and a gold watch fob. “Did he have any idea what war was like?” Mr. Wilson asks. “If so, why did he dress for it like a French landscape painter?”

Brady lost his Bull Run images in the tumult and rarely went near a battlefield again. He sent teams of photographers to the war’s fronts instead. He ran something like an early version of the Magnum agency.There’s been abiding controversy about who actually took many of the photographs attributed to Brady. Mr. Wilson wades through these issues patiently, almost photo by photo. He mostly comes to his subject’s defense.“The idea that Brady stifled his photographers, or took undue credit for work that was theirs — undue by the standards of their day, not ours — is based on supposition and not evidence, and seems wrongheaded,” Mr. Wilson comments. “Brady allowed his photographers not only to freelance for the Army while working for him, but also to copyright the photographs they took while in his employ.”Brady’s biggest photographic accomplishment may have been the familiar image he took of the defeated General Lee in Richmond shortly after the South had surrendered at Appomattox. “It was supposed that after his defeat it would be preposterous to ask him to sit,” Brady said later in an interview. “I thought that to be the right time for the historic picture.”Brady was right. “Who but Brady could have pulled off this photographic and journalistic coup?” Mr. Wilson asks. Among the reasons he could do so is that, because of his longtime interest in photographing military men, he’d known Lee since the Mexican War.

In the photographs, the author notes, the grizzled Lee “summons the strength of his unusual personal dignity for Brady’s camera, showing no trace of the humiliation of defeat but only a self-possessed seriousness.” He “gave the South a hero to cling to in those dark days after the war, and for decades to come.”

Brady’s career went slowly downhill after the war. There were bankruptcies. Some said he drank too much. Even late in life, however, as his health was failing, friends would report things like how “at the sight of me his face lit up with his characteristic winning smile.”Brady’s early photographs of Lincoln had helped imprint the politician on the public mind. “Brady and the Cooper Institute made me president,” Lincoln supposedly said, referring to a speech he gave in the Great Hall at Cooper Union during the 1860 campaign.When Lincoln received a request for a photograph, he responded by writing that while he was in New York, “I was taken to one of those places where they get up such things, and I suppose they got my shadow and can multiply copies indefinitely.”Brady understood the history he was helping to make. As an advertisement for one of his portrait services once warned, accurately if heavy-handedly, “You cannot tell how soon it may be too late.”

Mathew B. Brady (May 18, 1822 – January 15, 1896) was one of the earliest photographers in American history, best known for his scenes of the Civil War.
He studied under inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in America. Brady opened his own studio in New York in 1844, and photographed Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, among other celebrities. When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself.
After the war, these pictures went out of fashion, and the government did not purchase the master-copies as he had anticipated. Brady’s fortunes declined sharply, and he died in debt.

Early life[edit]




Lithograph of Brady, c. 1845


Brady was born on May 18, 1822, in Warren County, New York near Lake George, the youngest of three children of Irish immigrant parents, Andrew and Samantha Julia Brady.[1] He himself originally said that he was born in Ireland.[2]
Career[edit]
At age 16, Brady moved to Saratoga, New York, where he met portrait painter William Page, and became Page's student. In 1839, the two traveled to Albany, New York, and then to New York City, where Brady continued to study painting with Page, and also with Page's former teacher, Samuel F. B. Morse.[3] Morse had met Louis Jacques Daguerre in France in 1839, and returned to the US to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images. At first, Brady's involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes.[4] But soon he became the center of the New York artistic colony that wished to study photography. Morse opened a studio and offered classes; Brady was one of the first students.[5][better source needed]
In 1844, Brady opened his own photography studio in New York,[6] and by 1845, he began to exhibit his portraits of famous Americans, including the likes of Senator Daniel Webster and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In 1849, he opened a studio in Washington, D.C. where he met Juliet (whom everybody called 'Julia') Handy, whom he married in 1851 and lived with on Staten Island.[7][8] Brady's early images were daguerreotypes, and he won many awards for his work; in the 1850s ambrotype photography became popular, which gave way to the albumen print, a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the American Civil War photography.
In 1850, Brady produced The Gallery of Illustrious Americans, a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures. The album, which featured noteworthy images including the elderly Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to Brady’s work and artistry.[3] In 1854, Parisian photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri popularized the carte de visite and these small pictures (the size of a visiting card) rapidly became a popular novelty; thousands were created and sold in the United States and Europe.
In 1856, Brady placed an ad in the New York Herald offering to produce "photographs, ambrotypes and daguerreotypes."[9] This inventive ad pioneered, in the US, the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements.[10]
Civil War documentation[edit]

Soldier guarding arsenal Washington, D.C., 1862


At first, the effect of the Civil War on Brady's business was a brisk increase in sales of cartes de visite to departing soldiers. Brady readily marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers' images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in The New York Daily Tribune that warned, "You cannot tell how soon it may be too late."[4] However, he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself. He first applied to an old friend, General Winfield Scott, for permission to travel to the battle sites, and eventually he made his application to President Lincoln himself. Lincoln granted permission in 1861, with the proviso that Brady finance the project himself.[1]
His efforts to document the American Civil War on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned Brady his place in history. Despite the dangers, financial risk, and discouragement by his friends, Brady was later quoted as saying "I had to go. A spirit in my feet said 'Go,' and I went." His first popular photographs of the conflict were at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture. While most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken, Brady came under direct fire at the First Battle of Bull Run, Petersburg, and Fredericksburg.




Portrait of Brady by Charles Loring Elliott, 1857


He also employed Alexander Gardner,[11] James Gardner, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, William Pywell, George N. Barnard, Thomas C. Roche, and seventeen other men, each of whom was given a traveling darkroom, to go out and photograph scenes from the Civil War. Brady generally stayed in Washington, D.C., organizing his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally. However, as author Roy Meredith points out, "He [Brady] was essentially the director. The actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important, but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important, if not more so than just 'snapping the shutter.'"[12]
This may have been due, at least in part, to the fact that Brady's eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the 1850s. Many of the images in Brady’s collection are, in reality, thought to be the work of his assistants. Brady was criticized for failing to document the work, though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image. Because so much of Brady’s photography is missing information, it is difficult to know not only who took the picture, but also exactly when or where it was taken.
In October 1862 Brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the Battle of Antietam in his New York gallery, titled The Dead of Antietam. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America. This was the first time that many Americans saw the realities of war in photographs, as distinct from previous "artists' impressions".
Mathew Brady, through his many paid assistants, took thousands of photos of American Civil War scenes. Much of the popular understanding of the Civil War comes from these photos. There are thousands of photos in the US National Archives and the Library of Congress taken by Brady and his associates, Alexander Gardner, George Barnard and Timothy O'Sullivan.[11] The photographs include Lincoln, Grant, and soldiers in camps and battlefields. The images provide a pictorial cross reference of American Civil War history. Brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes, as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still in order for a clear photo to be produced.[13]
Following the conflict, a war-weary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war, and Brady’s popularity and practice declined drastically.
Later years and death[edit]




Photograph of Brady, c. 1889


During the war, Brady spent over $100,000 to create over 10,000 plates. He expected the US government to buy the photographs when the war ended. When the government refused to do so he was forced to sell his New York City studio and go into bankruptcy. Congress granted Brady $25,000 in 1875, but he remained deeply in debt. The public was unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the war after it had ended, and so private collectors were scarce. Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, he died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications following a streetcar accident.
Brady's funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
Levin Corbin Handy, Brady's nephew by marriage, took over Brady's photography business after his death.
Legacy[edit]




Photograph of Abraham Lincoln taken by Brady on the day of Lincoln's Cooper Union speech


Brady photographed 18 of the 19 American Presidents from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley. The exception was the 9th President, William Henry Harrison, who died in office three years before Brady started his photographic collection. Brady photographed Abraham Lincoln on many occasions. His Lincoln photographs have been used for the $5 bill and the Lincoln penny. One of his Lincoln photos was used by the National Bank Note Company as a model for the engraving on the 90c Lincoln Postage issue of 1869.[14]
The thousands of photographs which Mathew Brady's photographers (such as Alexander Gardner and Timothy O'Sullivan) took have become the most important visual documentation of the Civil War, and have helped historians and the public better understand the era.
Brady photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including:


Ulysses S. Grant
Nathaniel Banks
Don Carlos Buell
Ambrose Burnside
Benjamin Butler
Joshua Chamberlain
George Custer
David Farragut
John Gibbon
Winfield Hancock
Samuel P. Heintzelman
Joseph Hooker
Oliver Otis Howard
David Hunter
John A. Logan
Irvin McDowell
George McClellan
James McPherson
George Meade
Montgomery C. Meigs
David Dixon Porter
William Rosecrans
John Schofield
William Sherman
Daniel Sickles
Henry Warner Slocum
George Stoneman
Edwin V. Sumner
George Thomas
Emory Upton
James Wadsworth
Lew Wallace


On the Confederate side, Brady photographed: Jefferson Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, James Longstreet, James Henry Hammond, and Robert E. Lee.[15] Brady also photographed Lord Lyons, the British ambassador to Washington during the Civil War.
Photojournalism and honors[edit]
Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism.[16] He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a "corporate credit line." In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled “Photo by Brady;” however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others.[17]
As perhaps the best-known US photographer in the 19th century, it was Brady's name that came to be attached to the era's heavy specialized end tables which were factory-made specifically for use by portrait photographers. Such a "Brady stand" of the mid-19th century typically had a weighty cast iron base for stability, plus an adjustable-height single-column pipe leg for dual use as either a portrait model's armrest or (when fully extended and fitted with a brace attachment rather than the usual tabletop) as a neck rest. The latter was often needed to keep models steady during the longer exposure times of early photography. While Brady stand is a convenient term for these trade-specific articles of studio equipment, there is no proven connection between Brady himself and the Brady stand's invention circa 1855.[18]
Following considerable controversy around the racist history of city founder W. Tate Brady, for whom a major street and neighborhood was named, the City Council of Tulsa, OK on August 15, 2013, voted to retain the name Brady Street, but that it would now honor Mathew B. Brady instead.
Books and documentaries[edit]
Brady and his Studio produced over 7,000 pictures (mostly two negatives of each). One set "after undergoing extraordinary vicissitudes," came into U.S. government possession. His own negatives passed in the 1870s to E. & H. T. Anthony & Company of New York, in default of payment for photographic supplies. They "were kicked about from pillar to post" for 10 years, until John C. Taylor found them in an attic and bought them; from this they became "the backbone of the Ordway–Rand collection; and in 1895 Brady himself had no idea of what had become of them. Many were broken, lost, or destroyed by fire. After passing to various other owners, they were discovered and appreciated by Edward Bailey Eaton," who set in motion "events that led to their importance as the nucleus of a collection of Civil War photos published in 1912 as The Photographic History of the Civil War.[19]
Some of the lost images are mentioned in the last episode of Ken Burns' 1990 documentary on the Civil War. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.[20]
Exhibitions[edit]
On September 19, 1862, two days after the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of combat on U.S. soil with more than 23,000 killed, wounded or missing, Mathew Brady sent photographer Alexander Gardner and his assistant James Gibson to photograph the carnage. In October 1862, Brady displayed the photos by Gardner at Brady's New York gallery under the title "The Dead of Antietam."[21] The New York Times published a review.[22]
In October 2012, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine displayed 21 original Mathew Brady photographs from 1862 documenting the Civil War's Battle of Antietam.[21]

Mathew B. Brady (May 18, 1822 – January 15, 1896) was one of the earliest photographers in American history, best known for his scenes of the Civil War.
He studied under inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in America. Brady opened his own studio in New York in 1844, and photographed Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, among other celebrities. When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself.
After the war, these pictures went out of fashion, and the government did not purchase the master-copies as he had anticipated. Brady’s fortunes declined sharply, and he died in debt.

Early life[edit]




Lithograph of Brady, c. 1845


Brady was born on May 18, 1822, in Warren County, New York near Lake George, the youngest of three children of Irish immigrant parents, Andrew and Samantha Julia Brady.[1] He himself originally said that he was born in Ireland.[2]
Career[edit]
At age 16, Brady moved to Saratoga, New York, where he met portrait painter William Page, and became Page's student. In 1839, the two traveled to Albany, New York, and then to New York City, where Brady continued to study painting with Page, and also with Page's former teacher, Samuel F. B. Morse.[3] Morse had met Louis Jacques Daguerre in France in 1839, and returned to the US to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images. At first, Brady's involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes.[4] But soon he became the center of the New York artistic colony that wished to study photography. Morse opened a studio and offered classes; Brady was one of the first students.[5][better source needed]
In 1844, Brady opened his own photography studio in New York,[6] and by 1845, he began to exhibit his portraits of famous Americans, including the likes of Senator Daniel Webster and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In 1849, he opened a studio in Washington, D.C. where he met Juliet (whom everybody called 'Julia') Handy, whom he married in 1851 and lived with on Staten Island.[7][8] Brady's early images were daguerreotypes, and he won many awards for his work; in the 1850s ambrotype photography became popular, which gave way to the albumen print, a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the American Civil War photography.
In 1850, Brady produced The Gallery of Illustrious Americans, a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures. The album, which featured noteworthy images including the elderly Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to Brady’s work and artistry.[3] In 1854, Parisian photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri popularized the carte de visite and these small pictures (the size of a visiting card) rapidly became a popular novelty; thousands were created and sold in the United States and Europe.
In 1856, Brady placed an ad in the New York Herald offering to produce "photographs, ambrotypes and daguerreotypes."[9] This inventive ad pioneered, in the US, the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements.[10]
Civil War documentation[edit]

Soldier guarding arsenal Washington, D.C., 1862


At first, the effect of the Civil War on Brady's business was a brisk increase in sales of cartes de visite to departing soldiers. Brady readily marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers' images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in The New York Daily Tribune that warned, "You cannot tell how soon it may be too late."[4] However, he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself. He first applied to an old friend, General Winfield Scott, for permission to travel to the battle sites, and eventually he made his application to President Lincoln himself. Lincoln granted permission in 1861, with the proviso that Brady finance the project himself.[1]
His efforts to document the American Civil War on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned Brady his place in history. Despite the dangers, financial risk, and discouragement by his friends, Brady was later quoted as saying "I had to go. A spirit in my feet said 'Go,' and I went." His first popular photographs of the conflict were at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture. While most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken, Brady came under direct fire at the First Battle of Bull Run, Petersburg, and Fredericksburg.




Portrait of Brady by Charles Loring Elliott, 1857


He also employed Alexander Gardner,[11] James Gardner, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, William Pywell, George N. Barnard, Thomas C. Roche, and seventeen other men, each of whom was given a traveling darkroom, to go out and photograph scenes from the Civil War. Brady generally stayed in Washington, D.C., organizing his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally. However, as author Roy Meredith points out, "He [Brady] was essentially the director. The actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important, but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important, if not more so than just 'snapping the shutter.'"[12]
This may have been due, at least in part, to the fact that Brady's eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the 1850s. Many of the images in Brady’s collection are, in reality, thought to be the work of his assistants. Brady was criticized for failing to document the work, though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image. Because so much of Brady’s photography is missing information, it is difficult to know not only who took the picture, but also exactly when or where it was taken.
In October 1862 Brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the Battle of Antietam in his New York gallery, titled The Dead of Antietam. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America. This was the first time that many Americans saw the realities of war in photographs, as distinct from previous "artists' impressions".
Mathew Brady, through his many paid assistants, took thousands of photos of American Civil War scenes. Much of the popular understanding of the Civil War comes from these photos. There are thousands of photos in the US National Archives and the Library of Congress taken by Brady and his associates, Alexander Gardner, George Barnard and Timothy O'Sullivan.[11] The photographs include Lincoln, Grant, and soldiers in camps and battlefields. The images provide a pictorial cross reference of American Civil War history. Brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes, as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still in order for a clear photo to be produced.[13]
Following the conflict, a war-weary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war, and Brady’s popularity and practice declined drastically.
Later years and death[edit]




Photograph of Brady, c. 1889


During the war, Brady spent over $100,000 to create over 10,000 plates. He expected the US government to buy the photographs when the war ended. When the government refused to do so he was forced to sell his New York City studio and go into bankruptcy. Congress granted Brady $25,000 in 1875, but he remained deeply in debt. The public was unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the war after it had ended, and so private collectors were scarce. Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, he died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications following a streetcar accident.
Brady's funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
Levin Corbin Handy, Brady's nephew by marriage, took over Brady's photography business after his death.
Legacy[edit]




Photograph of Abraham Lincoln taken by Brady on the day of Lincoln's Cooper Union speech


Brady photographed 18 of the 19 American Presidents from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley. The exception was the 9th President, William Henry Harrison, who died in office three years before Brady started his photographic collection. Brady photographed Abraham Lincoln on many occasions. His Lincoln photographs have been used for the $5 bill and the Lincoln penny. One of his Lincoln photos was used by the National Bank Note Company as a model for the engraving on the 90c Lincoln Postage issue of 1869.[14]
The thousands of photographs which Mathew Brady's photographers (such as Alexander Gardner and Timothy O'Sullivan) took have become the most important visual documentation of the Civil War, and have helped historians and the public better understand the era.
Brady photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including:


Ulysses S. Grant
Nathaniel Banks
Don Carlos Buell
Ambrose Burnside
Benjamin Butler
Joshua Chamberlain
George Custer
David Farragut
John Gibbon
Winfield Hancock
Samuel P. Heintzelman
Joseph Hooker
Oliver Otis Howard
David Hunter
John A. Logan
Irvin McDowell
George McClellan
James McPherson
George Meade
Montgomery C. Meigs
David Dixon Porter
William Rosecrans
John Schofield
William Sherman
Daniel Sickles
Henry Warner Slocum
George Stoneman
Edwin V. Sumner
George Thomas
Emory Upton
James Wadsworth
Lew Wallace


On the Confederate side, Brady photographed: Jefferson Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, James Longstreet, James Henry Hammond, and Robert E. Lee.[15] Brady also photographed Lord Lyons, the British ambassador to Washington during the Civil War.
Photojournalism and honors[edit]
Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism.[16] He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a "corporate credit line." In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled “Photo by Brady;” however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others.[17]
As perhaps the best-known US photographer in the 19th century, it was Brady's name that came to be attached to the era's heavy specialized end tables which were factory-made specifically for use by portrait photographers. Such a "Brady stand" of the mid-19th century typically had a weighty cast iron base for stability, plus an adjustable-height single-column pipe leg for dual use as either a portrait model's armrest or (when fully extended and fitted with a brace attachment rather than the usual tabletop) as a neck rest. The latter was often needed to keep models steady during the longer exposure times of early photography. While Brady stand is a convenient term for these trade-specific articles of studio equipment, there is no proven connection between Brady himself and the Brady stand's invention circa 1855.[18]
Following considerable controversy around the racist history of city founder W. Tate Brady, for whom a major street and neighborhood was named, the City Council of Tulsa, OK on August 15, 2013, voted to retain the name Brady Street, but that it would now honor Mathew B. Brady instead.
Books and documentaries[edit]
Brady and his Studio produced over 7,000 pictures (mostly two negatives of each). One set "after undergoing extraordinary vicissitudes," came into U.S. government possession. His own negatives passed in the 1870s to E. & H. T. Anthony & Company of New York, in default of payment for photographic supplies. They "were kicked about from pillar to post" for 10 years, until John C. Taylor found them in an attic and bought them; from this they became "the backbone of the Ordway–Rand collection; and in 1895 Brady himself had no idea of what had become of them. Many were broken, lost, or destroyed by fire. After passing to various other owners, they were discovered and appreciated by Edward Bailey Eaton," who set in motion "events that led to their importance as the nucleus of a collection of Civil War photos published in 1912 as The Photographic History of the Civil War.[19]
Some of the lost images are mentioned in the last episode of Ken Burns' 1990 documentary on the Civil War. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.[20]
Exhibitions[edit]
On September 19, 1862, two days after the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of combat on U.S. soil with more than 23,000 killed, wounded or missing, Mathew Brady sent photographer Alexander Gardner and his assistant James Gibson to photograph the carnage. In October 1862, Brady displayed the photos by Gardner at Brady's New York gallery under the title "The Dead of Antietam."[21] The New York Times published a review.[22]
In October 2012, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine displayed 21 original Mathew Brady photographs from 1862 documenting the Civil War's Battle of Antietam.[21]

Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, he died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications following a streetcar accident.
Brady's funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
Levin Corbin Handy, Brady's nephew by marriage, took over Brady's photography business after his death.
Legacy[edit]




Photograph of Abraham Lincoln taken by Brady on the day of Lincoln's Cooper Union speech


Brady photographed 18 of the 19 American Presidents from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley. The exception was the 9th President, William Henry Harrison, who died in office three years before Brady started his photographic collection. Brady photographed Abraham Lincoln on many occasions. His Lincoln photographs have been used for the $5 bill and the Lincoln penny. One of his Lincoln photos was used by the National Bank Note Company as a model for the engraving on the 90c Lincoln Postage issue of 1869.[14]
The thousands of photographs which Mathew Brady's photographers (such as Alexander Gardner and Timothy O'Sullivan) took have become the most important visual documentation of the Civil War, and have helped historians and the public better understand the era.
Brady photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including:


Ulysses S. Grant
Nathaniel Banks
Don Carlos Buell
Ambrose Burnside
Benjamin Butler
Joshua Chamberlain
George Custer
David Farragut

On the Confederate side, Brady photographed: Jefferson Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, James Longstreet, James Henry Hammond, and Robert E. Lee.[15] Brady also photographed Lord Lyons, the British ambassador to Washington during the Civil War.
Photojournalism and honors[edit]
Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism.[16] He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a "corporate credit line." In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled “Photo by Brady;” however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others.[17]
As perhaps the best-known US photographer in the 19th century, it was Brady's name that came to be attached to the era's heavy specialized end tables which were factory-made specifically for use by portrait photographers. Such a "Brady stand" of the mid-19th century typically had a weighty cast iron base for stability, plus an adjustable-height single-column pipe leg for dual use as either a portrait model's armrest or (when fully extended and fitted with a brace attachment rather than the usual tabletop) as a neck rest. The latter was often needed to keep models steady during the longer exposure times of early photography. While Brady stand is a convenient term for these trade-specific articles of studio equipment, there is no proven connection between Brady himself and the Brady stand's invention circa 1855.[18]
Following considerable controversy around the racist history of city founder W. Tate Brady, for whom a major street and neighborhood was named, the City Council of Tulsa, OK on August 15, 2013, voted to retain the name Brady Street, but that it would now honor Mathew B. Brady instead.
Books and documentaries[edit]
Brady and his Studio produced over 7,000 pictures (mostly two negatives of each). One set "after undergoing extraordinary vicissitudes," came into U.S. government possession. His own negatives passed in the 1870s to E. & H. T. Anthony & Company of New York, in default of payment for photographic supplies. They "were kicked about from pillar to post" for 10 years, until John C. Taylor found them in an attic and bought them; from this they became "the backbone of the Ordway–Rand collection; and in 1895 Brady himself had no idea of what had become of them. Many were broken, lost, or destroyed by fire. After passing to various other owners, they were discovered and appreciated by Edward Bailey Eaton," who set in motion "events that led to their importance as the nucleus of a collection of Civil War photos published in 1912 as The Photographic History of the Civil War.[19]
Some of the lost images are mentioned in the last episode of Ken Burns' 1990 documentary on the Civil War. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.[20]
Exhibitions[edit]
On September 19, 1862, two days after the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of combat on U.S. soil with more than 23,000 killed, wounded or missing, Mathew Brady sent photographer Alexander Gardner and his assistant James Gibson to photograph the carnage. In October 1862, Brady displayed the photos by Gardner at Brady's New York gallery under the title "The Dead of Antietam."[21] The New York Times published a review.[22]
In October 2012, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine displayed 21 original Mathew Brady photographs from 1862 documenting the Civil War's Battle of Antietam.[21]

Mathew B. Brady (May 18, 1822 – January 15, 1896) was one of the earliest photographers in American history, best known for his scenes of the Civil War.
He studied under inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in America. Brady opened his own studio in New York in 1844, and photographed Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, among other celebrities. When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself.
After the war, these pictures went out of fashion, and the government did not purchase the master-copies as he had anticipated. Brady’s fortunes declined sharply, and he died in debt.

Early life[edit]




Lithograph of Brady, c. 1845


Brady was born on May 18, 1822, in Warren County, New York near Lake George, the youngest of three children of Irish immigrant parents, Andrew and Samantha Julia Brady.[1] He himself originally said that he was born in Ireland.[2]
Career[edit]
At age 16, Brady moved to Saratoga, New York, where he met portrait painter William Page, and became Page's student. In 1839, the two traveled to Albany, New York, and then to New York City, where Brady continued to study painting with Page, and also with Page's former teacher, Samuel F. B. Morse.[3] Morse had met Louis Jacques Daguerre in France in 1839, and returned to the US to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images. At first, Brady's involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes.[4] But soon he became the center of the New York artistic colony that wished to study photography. Morse opened a studio and offered classes; Brady was one of the first students.[5][better source needed]
In 1844, Brady opened his own photography studio in New York,[6] and by 1845, he began to exhibit his portraits of famous Americans, including the likes of Senator Daniel Webster and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In 1849, he opened a studio in Washington, D.C. where he met Juliet (whom everybody called 'Julia') Handy, whom he married in 1851 and lived with on Staten Island.[7][8] Brady's early images were daguerreotypes, and he won many awards for his work; in the 1850s ambrotype photography became popular, which gave way to the albumen print, a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the American Civil War photography.
In 1850, Brady produced The Gallery of Illustrious Americans, a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures. The album, which featured noteworthy images including the elderly Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to Brady’s work and artistry.[3] In 1854, Parisian photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri popularized the carte de visite and these small pictures (the size of a visiting card) rapidly became a popular novelty; thousands were created and sold in the United States and Europe.
In 1856, Brady placed an ad in the New York Herald offering to produce "photographs, ambrotypes and daguerreotypes."[9] This inventive ad pioneered, in the US, the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements.[10]
Civil War documentation[edit]

Soldier guarding arsenal Washington, D.C., 1862


At first, the effect of the Civil War on Brady's business was a brisk increase in sales of cartes de visite to departing soldiers. Brady readily marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers' images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in The New York Daily Tribune that warned, "You cannot tell how soon it may be too late."[4] However, he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself. He first applied to an old friend, General Winfield Scott, for permission to travel to the battle sites, and eventually he made his application to President Lincoln himself. Lincoln granted permission in 1861, with the proviso that Brady finance the project himself.[1]
His efforts to document the American Civil War on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned Brady his place in history. Despite the dangers, financial risk, and discouragement by his friends, Brady was later quoted as saying "I had to go. A spirit in my feet said 'Go,' and I went." His first popular photographs of the conflict were at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture. While most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken, Brady came under direct fire at the First Battle of Bull Run, Petersburg, and Fredericksburg.




Portrait of Brady by Charles Loring Elliott, 1857


He also employed Alexander Gardner,[11] James Gardner, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, William Pywell, George N. Barnard, Thomas C. Roche, and seventeen other men, each of whom was given a traveling darkroom, to go out and photograph scenes from the Civil War. Brady generally stayed in Washington, D.C., organizing his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally. However, as author Roy Meredith points out, "He [Brady] was essentially the director. The actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important, but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important, if not more so than just 'snapping the shutter.'"[12]
This may have been due, at least in part, to the fact that Brady's eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the 1850s. Many of the images in Brady’s collection are, in reality, thought to be the work of his assistants. Brady was criticized for failing to document the work, though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image. Because so much of Brady’s photography is missing information, it is difficult to know not only who took the picture, but also exactly when or where it was taken.
In October 1862 Brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the Battle of Antietam in his New York gallery, titled The Dead of Antietam. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America. This was the first time that many Americans saw the realities of war in photographs, as distinct from previous "artists' impressions".
Mathew Brady, through his many paid assistants, took thousands of photos of American Civil War scenes. Much of the popular understanding of the Civil War comes from these photos. There are thousands of photos in the US National Archives and the Library of Congress taken by Brady and his associates, Alexander Gardner, George Barnard and Timothy O'Sullivan.[11] The photographs include Lincoln, Grant, and soldiers in camps and battlefields. The images provide a pictorial cross reference of American Civil War history. Brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes, as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still in order for a clear photo to be produced.[13]
Following the conflict, a war-weary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war, and Brady’s popularity and practice declined drastically.
Later years and death[edit]




Photograph of Brady, c. 1889


During the war, Brady spent over $100,000 to create over 10,000 plates. He expected the US government to buy the photographs when the war ended. When the government refused to do so he was forced to sell his New York City studio and go into bankruptcy. Congress granted Brady $25,000 in 1875, but he remained deeply in debt. The public was unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the war after it had ended, and so private collectors were scarce. Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, he died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications following a streetcar accident.
Brady's funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
Levin Corbin Handy, Brady's nephew by marriage, took over Brady's photography business after his death.

Mathew B. Brady (May 18, 1822 – January 15, 1896) was one of the earliest photographers in American history, best known for his scenes of the Civil War.
He studied under inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in America. Brady opened his own studio in New York in 1844, and photographed Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, among other celebrities. When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself.
After the war, these pictures went out of fashion, and the government did not purchase the master-copies as he had anticipated. Brady’s fortunes declined sharply, and he died in debt.

Early life[edit]




Lithograph of Brady, c. 1845


Brady was born on May 18, 1822, in Warren County, New York near Lake George, the youngest of three children of Irish immigrant parents, Andrew and Samantha Julia Brady.[1] He himself originally said that he was born in Ireland.[2]
Career[edit]
At age 16, Brady moved to Saratoga, New York, where he met portrait painter William Page, and became Page's student. In 1839, the two traveled to Albany, New York, and then to New York City, where Brady continued to study painting with Page, and also with Page's former teacher, Samuel F. B. Morse.[3] Morse had met Louis Jacques Daguerre in France in 1839, and returned to the US to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images. At first, Brady's involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes.[4] But soon he became the center of the New York artistic colony that wished to study photography. Morse opened a studio and offered classes; Brady was one of the first students.[5][better source needed]
In 1844, Brady opened his own photography studio in New York,[6] and by 1845, he began to exhibit his portraits of famous Americans, including the likes of Senator Daniel Webster and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In 1849, he opened a studio in Washington, D.C. where he met Juliet (whom everybody called 'Julia') Handy, whom he married in 1851 and lived with on Staten Island.[7][8] Brady's early images were daguerreotypes, and he won many awards for his work; in the 1850s ambrotype photography became popular, which gave way to the albumen print, a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the American Civil War photography.
In 1850, Brady produced The Gallery of Illustrious Americans, a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures. The album, which featured noteworthy images including the elderly Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to Brady’s work and artistry.[3] In 1854, Parisian photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri popularized the carte de visite and these small pictures (the size of a visiting card) rapidly became a popular novelty; thousands were created and sold in the United States and Europe.
In 1856, Brady placed an ad in the New York Herald offering to produce "photographs, ambrotypes and daguerreotypes."[9] This inventive ad pioneered, in the US, the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements.[10]
Civil War documentation[edit]

Soldier guarding arsenal Washington, D.C., 1862


At first, the effect of the Civil War on Brady's business was a brisk increase in sales of cartes de visite to departing soldiers. Brady readily marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers' images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in The New York Daily Tribune that warned, "You cannot tell how soon it may be too late."[4] However, he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself. He first applied to an old friend, General Winfield Scott, for permission to travel to the battle sites, and eventually he made his application to President Lincoln himself. Lincoln granted permission in 1861, with the proviso that Brady finance the project himself.[1]
His efforts to document the American Civil War on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned Brady his place in history. Despite the dangers, financial risk, and discouragement by his friends, Brady was later quoted as saying "I had to go. A spirit in my feet said 'Go,' and I went." His first popular photographs of the conflict were at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture. While most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken, Brady came under direct fire at the First Battle of Bull Run, Petersburg, and Fredericksburg.




Portrait of Brady by Charles Loring Elliott, 1857


He also employed Alexander Gardner,[11] James Gardner, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, William Pywell, George N. Barnard, Thomas C. Roche, and seventeen other men, each of whom was given a traveling darkroom, to go out and photograph scenes from the Civil War. Brady generally stayed in Washington, D.C., organizing his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally. However, as author Roy Meredith points out, "He [Brady] was essentially the director. The actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important, but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important, if not more so than just 'snapping the shutter.'"[12]
This may have been due, at least in part, to the fact that Brady's eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the 1850s. Many of the images in Brady’s collection are, in reality, thought to be the work of his assistants. Brady was criticized for failing to document the work, though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image. Because so much of Brady’s photography is missing information, it is difficult to know not only who took the picture, but also exactly when or where it was taken.
In October 1862 Brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the Battle of Antietam in his New York gallery, titled The Dead of Antietam. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America. This was the first time that many Americans saw the realities of war in photographs, as distinct from previous "artists' impressions".
Mathew Brady, through his many paid assistants, took thousands of photos of American Civil War scenes. Much of the popular understanding of the Civil War comes from these photos. There are thousands of photos in the US National Archives and the Library of Congress taken by Brady and his associates, Alexander Gardner, George Barnard and Timothy O'Sullivan.[11] The photographs include Lincoln, Grant, and soldiers in camps and battlefields. The images provide a pictorial cross reference of American Civil War history. Brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes, as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still in order for a clear photo to be produced.[13]
Following the conflict, a war-weary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war, and Brady’s popularity and practice declined drastically.
Later years and death[edit]




Photograph of Brady, c. 1889


During the war, Brady spent over $100,000 to create over 10,000 plates. He expected the US government to buy the photographs when the war ended. When the government refused to do so he was forced to sell his New York City studio and go into bankruptcy. Congress granted Brady $25,000 in 1875, but he remained deeply in debt. The public was unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the war after it had ended, and so private collectors were scarce. Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, he died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications following a streetcar accident.
Brady's funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
Levin Corbin Handy, Brady's nephew by marriage, took over Brady's photography business after his death.
Legacy[edit]




Photograph of Abraham Lincoln taken by Brady on the day of Lincoln's Cooper Union speech


Brady photographed 18 of the 19 American Presidents from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley. The exception was the 9th President, William Henry Harrison, who died in office three years before Brady started his photographic collection. Brady photographed Abraham Lincoln on many occasions. His Lincoln photographs have been used for the $5 bill and the Lincoln penny. One of his Lincoln photos was used by the National Bank Note Company as a model for the engraving on the 90c Lincoln Postage issue of 1869.[14]
The thousands of photographs which Mathew Brady's photographers (such as Alexander Gardner and Timothy O'Sullivan) took have become the most important visual documentation of the Civil War, and have helped historians and the public better understand the era.
Brady photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including:


Ulysses S. Grant
Nathaniel Banks
Don Carlos Buell
Ambrose Burnside
Benjamin Butler
Joshua Chamberlain
George Custer
David Farragut
John Gibbon
Winfield Hancock
Samuel P. Heintzelman
Joseph Hooker
Oliver Otis Howard
David Hunter
John A. Logan
Irvin McDowell
George McClellan
James McPherson
George Meade
Montgomery C. Meigs
David Dixon Porter
William Rosecrans
John Schofield
William Sherman
Daniel Sickles
Henry Warner Slocum
George Stoneman
Edwin V. Sumner
George Thomas
Emory Upton
James Wadsworth
Lew Wallace


On the Confederate side, Brady photographed: Jefferson Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, James Longstreet, James Henry Hammond, and Robert E. Lee.[15] Brady also photographed Lord Lyons, the British ambassador to Washington during the Civil War.
Photojournalism and honors[edit]
Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism.[16] He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a "corporate credit line." In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled “Photo by Brady;” however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others.[17]
As perhaps the best-known US photographer in the 19th century, it was Brady's name that came to be attached to the era's heavy specialized end tables which were factory-made specifically for use by portrait photographers. Such a "Brady stand" of the mid-19th century typically had a weighty cast iron base for stability, plus an adjustable-height single-column pipe leg for dual use as either a portrait model's armrest or (when fully extended and fitted with a brace attachment rather than the usual tabletop) as a neck rest. The latter was often needed to keep models steady during the longer exposure times of early photography. While Brady stand is a convenient term for these trade-specific articles of studio equipment, there is no proven connection between Brady himself and the Brady stand's invention circa 1855.[18]
Following considerable controversy around the racist history of city founder W. Tate Brady, for whom a major street and neighborhood was named, the City Council of Tulsa, OK on August 15, 2013, voted to retain the name Brady Street, but that it would now honor Mathew B. Brady instead.
Books and documentaries[edit]
Brady and his Studio produced over 7,000 pictures (mostly two negatives of each). One set "after undergoing extraordinary vicissitudes," came into U.S. government possession. His own negatives passed in the 1870s to E. & H. T. Anthony & Company of New York, in default of payment for photographic supplies. They "were kicked about from pillar to post" for 10 years, until John C. Taylor found them in an attic and bought them; from this they became "the backbone of the Ordway–Rand collection; and in 1895 Brady himself had no idea of what had become of them. Many were broken, lost, or destroyed by fire. After passing to various other owners, they were discovered and appreciated by Edward Bailey Eaton," who set in motion "events that led to their importance as the nucleus of a collection of Civil War photos published in 1912 as The Photographic History of the Civil War.[19]
Some of the lost images are mentioned in the last episode of Ken Burns' 1990 documentary on the Civil War. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.[20]
Exhibitions[edit]
On September 19, 1862, two days after the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of combat on U.S. soil with more than 23,000 killed, wounded or missing, Mathew Brady sent photographer Alexander Gardner and his assistant James Gibson to photograph the carnage. In October 1862, Brady displayed the photos by Gardner at Brady's New York gallery under the title "The Dead of Antietam."[21] The New York Times published a review.[22]
In October 2012, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine displayed 21 original Mathew Brady photographs from 1862 documenting the Civil War's Battle of Antietam.[21]

Matthew B. Brady Joins Westell Technologies as President and CEO




















July 10, 2017 09:01 ET

 | Source: Westell Technologies, Inc.






AURORA, Ill., July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westell Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTL), a leading provider of high-performance wireless infrastructure solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously chosen Matthew B. Brady as the Company’s new President and CEO, effective July 17, 2017.  Brady replaces interim President and CEO Kirk Brannock, who had planned to depart once a CEO transition plan was complete. Brady has over 25 years of experience in enhancing customer relationships, driving revenue growth, and improving operations and bottom-line results.  Most recently, he served as Senior Vice President of Federal Signal Corporation’s Safety and Security Systems Group.  Prior to leading the $240 million Safety and Security Systems Group, Brady was its Vice President of Global Sales.  Before that, he was Sales Director for Public Safety at Motorola Solutions.  Previously, Brady held executive sales and marketing positions at Clarity Communications Systems, Tellabs, and Motorola. “I am pleased and excited to join Westell,” said Brady.  “The Company has recently undergone a critical period of transition, and I believe Westell is well positioned for long-term sustained growth and profitability.  I look forward to building on the Company’s long-established reputation for delivering high-quality products and solutions, including the growing in-building wireless public safety communication market, as well as other fast-developing communication network applications.” “This is a great time for Matt to become Westell’s CEO.  After an extensive search, we’ve selected a leader with a strong track record of driving revenue growth,” said Dennis O. Harris, Chairman of Westell’s Board of Directors. “With his business strategy and execution track record, public safety experience, and long-standing customer relationships, Matt is the right choice to lead Westell.” “I want to acknowledge Kirk Brannock who has done a tremendous job since stepping in to fill the President and CEO role in October 2016,” Harris added. “During Kirk’s tenure, Westell completed an extensive cost and expense reduction program that is delivering improved profitability, growing cash, and nourishing a strong debt-free balance sheet.  At the same time, Kirk positioned the Company to address the emerging market for in-building wireless public safety communication.  Moving forward, Matt will focus on continuing to improve profitability and drive revenue growth.” To be added to the Westell email distribution list, please email marketing@westell.com. About Westell Technologies Westell is a leading provider of high-performance wireless infrastructure solutions focused on innovation and differentiation at the edge of communication networks where end users connect.  The Company's portfolio of products and solutions enables service providers and network operators to improve performance and reduce operating expenses.  With millions of products successfully deployed worldwide, Westell is a trusted partner for transforming networks into high-quality reliable systems.  For more information, please visit westell.com.

Civil War: The Mathew B. Brady Photograph Collection 

            Civil War: The Mathew B. Brady Photograph Collection of Civil War Scenes & Era Personalities with Finding Aid6,050 Civil War related photographs from the Mathew Brady Studios along with a 1,043 page table of contents/index.The photographs in this collection are from the Records of the Office of the Chief Signal Officer, Record Group 111, and Records of the War Department General and Special Staffs, Record Group 165, held at the Still Picture Branch of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The images include photographs from the Matthew B. Brady collection, purchased for $27,840 by the War Department in 1874 and 1875, photographs from the Quartermaster's Department of the Corps of Engineers, and photographs private citizens donated to the War Department. These collections were once part of the War Department Library.This collection consists of 6,050 images from glass plates (and modern derivative copies including prints, duplicate negatives, and interpositives) which were produced by the photographer Mathew Brady and his associates at the Brady Studios. Many images show battlefields, camps, towns, and people touched by the Civil War. Photographs capture camp life, routines, war preparations, the moments just prior to battle, and the aftermath of battle. Also of interest in this series are views of Union and Confederate naval vessels, railroads, supply dumps, and hospitals.The most well-known individual associated with Civil War photography is Mathew B. Brady (1823-1896). This is in spite of the fact that Brady may have only personally taken a few photographs of the war. Brady employed many of the other well-known photographers before and at points during the war. Alexander Gardner and James F. Gibson at different times managed Brady's Washington studio. Timothy O'Sullivan, James Gardner, and Egbert Guy Fox were also employed by Brady during the Civil War.Brady was one of the earliest practitioners of daguerreotype in the United States and soon became a prolific portrait photographer. In his New York and Washington, DC studios, he and his assistants photographed many of the luminaries of the 1850s and 1860s. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Brady endeavored to record the progress of the war with his camera. He and his associates, notably Alexander Gardner, George Barnard, and Timothy O'Sullivan, traveled throughout the eastern part of the country and photographed many of the battlefields, towns, and people touched by the war. In addition, Brady photographed many of the distinguished political and military personalities who found time to stop by his Washington, DC studio. The result was a collection of some 12,000 images which comprised a rich visual document of the Civil War period.The Brady Studio photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including Ulysses S. Grant, Nathaniel Banks, Don Carlos Buell, Ambrose Burnside, Benjamin Butler, Joshua Chamberlain, George Custer, David Farragut, John Gibbon, Winfield Hancock, Samuel P. Heintzelman, Joseph Hooker, Oliver Howard, David Hunter, John A. Logan, Irvin McDowell, George McClellan, James McPherson, George Meade, Montgomery C. Meigs, David Dixon Porter, William Rosecrans, John Schofield, William Sherman, Daniel Sickles, Henry Warner Slocum, George Stoneman, Edwin V. Sumner, George Thomas, Emory Upton, James Wadsworth, and Lew Wallace.On the Confederate side, Brady photographed Jefferson Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, James Longstreet, Lord Lyons, James Henry Hammond, and Robert E. Lee (Lee's first session with Brady was in 1845 as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, his final after the war in Richmond, Virginia).After the Civil War, business for Brady's studios gradually declined. Many negatives were lost due to neglect and disinterest in the years after the war. Ken Burns in his 1990 documentary on the Civil War claimed that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. As Burns said in his 1993 commencement address at the University of Delaware, "In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost."In July 1874 Secretary of War William Belknap purchased part of Brady's collection of negatives, approximately 2,250 plates, at public auction for $2,500 because of Brady's bankruptcy. In April 1875, the War Department purchased 3,735 plates directly from Brady under express Congressional authorization to "acquire a full and perfect title to secure and purchase the remainder now in possession of the artists [for] $25,000." The plates languished in the War Department's War Records Office until 1886 when they were transferred to the Supply Division. In 1888 the collection was transferred to the War Department Library. In 1921 the Office of the Chief Signal Officer secured custody of the collection in order to make duplicate prints and provide copies to the public. The collection was accessioned to the National Archives in 1940.Finding AidIn addition to the 6,050 pages above, included in this collection is a 1,043 page finding aid that includes a thumbnail of each photo and list each photo's title/description and identification numbers.

          All files are distributed to customers using CDN service to ensure highest download speeds on their end. This adds an extra cost for every file we deliver, so we charge a small transaction fee to be able to provide a great experience for you and your customers. With the PRO plan we've reduced the fee to a minimum.
        


Can I sell without PayPal account?

          Yes. If you don’t have a PayPal account, you can still receive payments with Stripe. If both PayPal and Stripe do not allow receiving payments in your country - you can only use Sellfy to offer free products.
        




How do I get paid?

          You will receive money instantly after the purchase is made. Payments will be made directly to your PayPal or Stripe account depending on which gateway you choose for payment processing.
        


Will I have any other expenses?

          On top of our transaction fee, you will need to cover payment processing fees of PayPal or Stripe (typically 2.9% + 30¢) depending on which payment gateway you choose.

"So easy to use..."

              Sellfy made selling online extremely easy and straightforward, there’s no hassle and your products take literally minutes to set up. With impressive sales and very reasonable fees, I’ve had nothing but good fortune with them.

"I was surprised..."

              I was surprised how fast and easy it was to start my business with Sellfy. Now I can focus completely on creation of new and beautiful products, expanding my range of goods and giving support to my costumers but leave the financial and delivery part to Sellfy.
