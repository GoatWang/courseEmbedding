NexTag Names Jeffrey G. Katz Chief Executive Officer




Seasoned CEO Brings Exceptional Track Record of Building Value at 
      Online Consumer Product and Services Companies






March 01, 2010 01:30 PM Eastern Standard Time



SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NexTag®, the leading comparison shopping website for products and 
      services, announced today that it has named Jeffrey G. Katz as Chief 
      Executive Officer. Mr. Katz most recently served as Chairman, President 
      and CEO of LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc., where he led the successful 
      expansion of the company’s online education product line and significant 
      growth in the company’s installed base. Previously, Mr. Katz was 
      Chairman and Founding CEO of Orbitz, Inc., a leading online travel 
      company. He also previously was President and CEO of Swissair and served 
      as President of the SABRE division of American Airlines.
    


      “Jeff brings an exceptional track record growing and creating value at a 
      wide array of significant online consumer product and services 
      companies,” said Purnendu Ojha, Co-founder and Chairman of the Board of 
      Directors. “His appointment is an important step in our plans to bolster 
      our team after the investment from Providence Equity Partners and my 
      decision to retire as President and CEO. The entire Board looks forward 
      to working with Jeff in the years ahead.”
    

      “NexTag is a clear leader in comparison shopping with a talented 
      employee base and an impressive array of technology capabilities,” said 
      Mr. Katz. “I am excited to have the opportunity to work with Scott 
      Simmons, NexTag’s President, the entire NexTag team, and our merchant 
      and traffic partners to implement what seems a clear path for profitable 
      growth in the U.S. and abroad in the years ahead.”
    

      “NexTag is one of the most significant private Internet companies 
      operating today with a large worldwide user base and strong market 
      position,” said Al Dobron, a Managing Director of Providence and a 
      NexTag Director. “Jeff is an excellent addition to the NexTag team and 
      the ideal CEO to lead the company forward. His proven expertise will be 
      invaluable, and he shares the company’s longstanding commitment to 
      innovation and to providing an unparalleled quality of service. We look 
      forward to working with him as we continue to build value over the 
      long-term at NexTag.”
    

      Starting in 2006, Mr. Katz served as President and CEO of LeapFrog, a 
      designer, developer, and marketer of innovative, technology-based 
      learning products and related proprietary content. In March 2009, he 
      became Chairman of the company. From 2000 through 2004, he was the 
      Chairman and Founding CEO of Orbitz Inc., the online travel company. 
      Under Mr. Katz’s leadership, Orbitz grew quickly in scale to be among 
      the top three online travel sites, with over $4 billion in gross sales. 
      From 1997 to 2000, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      Swissair, a publicly held airline. From 1980 to 1997, he served in a 
      variety of roles at American Airlines, including positions in finance, 
      pricing and sales, before being named Vice President of American 
      Airlines and President of the Computerized Reservation System Division 
      of SABRE.
    

      Mr. Katz received a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University 
      of California, Davis, and holds M.S. degrees from both Stanford 
      University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to their 
      merger with Delta Airlines, Mr. Katz served on the board of directors of 
      Northwest Airlines. He also previously served on the board of City of 
      Hope National Cancer Research Institute.
