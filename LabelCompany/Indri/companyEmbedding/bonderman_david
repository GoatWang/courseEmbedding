Here are all the controversies in one place. (Daron Taylor,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)   This story has been updated Billionaire businessman David Bonderman, a member of Uber’s board, resigned Tuesday after making what he called an “inappropriate” comment about women at a company-wide meeting that was aimed at addressing the harassment of women and other unprofessional conduct within the company. The comment came as an interruption of fellow board member Arianna Huffington, who was explaining the benefits of having more female representation on Uber's board. “There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,” said Huffington, according to several people who heard the remarks. “Actually,” Bonderman interjected, “what it shows is, it’s much likely there'll be more talking.” “Oh, come on, David,” Huffington said, in between awkward laughs. Addressing the crowd, she added, “Don't worry, David will have a lot of talking to do, as well.” In an email that was sent later to company employees, Bonderman said, “I want to apologize to my fellow board member for a disrespectful comment,” calling it “inappropriate.” Bonderman, the 74-year-old co-founder of a private equity firm, also apologized personally to Huffington. “David has apologized to all Uber employees for a remark that was totally inappropriate and against the new culture we are building at Uber,” Huffington said in a statement.    Uber board member David Bonderman, shown in 2014. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)  A few hours later, Bonderman resigned and released this statement: “Uber is examining the issues with its culture, and making significant changes and working to right what has been done wrong, which is extremely important for the future of the company. I do not want my comments to create distraction as Uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud. I need to hold myself to the same standards that we’re asking Uber to adopt." Huffington also issued a statement praising Bonderman for his decision, “I appreciate David doing the right thing for Uber at this time of critical cultural changes at the company.” The incident came as Uber sought to move past a leadership crisis that has led to the departure this week of chief executive Travis Kalanick for a leave of absence and the exit of his close ally and confidant Emil Michael, a senior vice president at Uber. Kalanick's return date was not specified, and his responsibilities will undergo “review” to possibly shift some duties to other executives. He also faces the likelihood of reduced clout on the board, which is adding new “independent” members and creating an oversight committee to monitor efforts to improve corporate ethics and diversity. “The ultimate responsibility, for where we’ve gotten and how we’ve gotten here rests on my shoulders,” Kalanick wrote in an email to employees. “There is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve. For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team. But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.” In describing reasons for the leave, Kalanick also cited the death of his mother and serious injury of his father in a boating accident last month, saying, “I need to take some time off of the day-to-day to grieve my mother, whom I buried on Friday, to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.” Tuesday marked the release of recommendations from a report by former U.S. attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. on Uber's workplace culture. Holder had been hired by Uber to address mounting criticism of the company. The full report is being withheld from the public and the bulk of the company's 14,000 employees worldwide. The 47 recommendations, which are sweeping and touch virtually every aspect of company management, were released at an employee meeting at the company's San Francisco headquarters Tuesday after being accepted by the board at a marathon meeting Sunday. Under the proposals, senior managers will undergo mandatory leadership training and Uber’s current position of head of diversity will be renamed as the “chief diversity and inclusion officer” and report directly to the chief executive or chief operating officer. Uber also will adopt the equivalent of the National Football League's “Rooney Rule” requiring that when the company is filling a key job, at least one woman and one minority candidate be interviewed before the hire can go forward. The report called for employee complaints to be handled using a comprehensive process and for upgrades to employee benefits, including equal family leave time for male and female workers. There also is a newly imposed ban on sexual relationships between employees at different levels of the staff hierarchy, and there are new limits on the consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs during the workday and at company events. Uber also announced Monday that it was adding a new member, Nestle executive Wan Ling Martello, to one of several empty seats on the board. She is expected to bring financial expertise while representing another high-profile female addition to a company criticized as exemplifying Silicon Valley's male-dominated “bro” culture. “This is a hugely significant event,” said Michael Useem, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said of the corporate overhaul. The list of recommendations reads like a textbook from “Leadership and Management 101” and, if implemented effectively, could serve as a model for other Silicon Valley companies grappling with diversity and harassment issues, Useem said. The public mood toward Uber began to turn when Kalanick joined an advisory board for President Trump and appeared to undermine a New York taxi strike related to the president’s controversial effort to impose a travel ban, sparking the #DeleteUber movement. A scathing blog post in February by former engineer Susan Fowler, who reported that an unwanted sexual advance by her boss was ignored by company management, triggered a wave of denunciations of the corporate culture at Uber.

      Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Celtics minority owner David Bonderman join KeyArena renovation group

          Updated June 7, 2017 at 10:12 pm        
























The addition of Bonderman and Bruckheimer provides the strongest signal yet that the Oak View Group intends to bring an NHL team to Seattle near-term and an NBA team further down the road.

By 
Geoff Baker and Daniel Beekman Seattle Times staff reporter 


A modern KeyArena under a historic roof, more big-time concerts and at least one new sports team — more likely a hockey club before a reincarnation of the Sonics.
That’s what Mayor Ed Murray and a collection of sports and entertainment executives on Wednesday said Seattleites can expect, as Murray officially announced Oak View Group (OVG) as his administration’s preferred choice to renovate KeyArena.
Introducing Hollywood film and TV producer Jerry Bruckheimer and billionaire investment banker David Bonderman as partners in the project, OVG said it intends to pursue an NHL team in the short term and an NBA team down the road.


“We’re going to get you a team,” said Tim Leiweke, OVG’s CEO. “Mark it right here. I promise you … we’re going to get you at least one team.”

The MOU with OVG would go to the Seattle City Council for approval.
The mayor said his goal is to complete the KeyArena deal before he leaves office at the end of the year and described it as integral to a grand vision for Seattle Center.
Built for the 1962 World’s Fair, the aging civic campus is now wedged between a dense downtown, Queen Anne and a booming tech-business hub in South Lake Union.
“It’s now time to seize this historic moment of growth and innovation in Seattle to build an arena for the 21st century,” Murray said.
“This is one part, one piece of a larger plan that is already in place to make Seattle Center an international icon district on par with Chicago’s Millennium Park” and cultural areas in Hong Kong and Montreal.
OVG’s $564 million proposal — one of two bids submitted in April — includes a partnership with major concert company Live Nation and would involve building “an entirely new area” under the venue’s existing roof, which is expected to be given historical landmark status.
Joined on stage by former Sonics player and coach Lenny Wilkens, a member of a city advisory panel, Murray said OVG’s bid was preferable to a bid by Seattle Partners partly because it had the “best design.”
Additionally, “I chose the proposal that had the best financial plan,” the mayor said. “The plan is privately financed and does not require any of the city’s bonding authority.”
Though it was Seattle Partners that requested $250 million in public bonding, OVG is seeking a minimum of $40 million in city taxes and revenues from the renovated arena.
“That’s something we will work out with them to get the city the best deal possible,” Murray told reporters.


The mayor said outstanding challenges, such as how a renovated arena would impact transportation in a crowded neighborhood, could still derail the deal.
Light rail is coming to the Seattle Center neighborhood, but not until 2035, according to Sound Transit’s projections.

Nicole Grant, executive secretary-treasurer of the Martin Luther King County Labor Council, praised the OVG plan, saying union workers are ready to make the renovations and serve KeyArena patrons.
Melinda Giovengo, president of YouthCare, said the proposal includes funding and potential job training for young people experiencing homelessness.
And Wilkens said, “If ever there was a chance for the Sonics to come back, it’s this opportunity here.”
But Murray and Leiweke were careful to downplay the possibility of men’s pro basketball returning to Seattle anytime soon. They said the NBA isn’t close to adding teams.
Vancouver, B.C., Canucks owner Francesco Aquilini was on hand Wednesday, lending support to the prospect of a Vancouver-Seattle hockey rivalry.
“We are already hard at work pursuing every opportunity,” Leiweke said.






“If the NHL so chooses to expand, we will be all over them. If there is a team that they choose to move, we will be all over them. If the NBA, and they’re not there yet, but should they at some point in the future begin to talk about expansion, we’ll be the first ones at the table.”
As for Hansen’s proposal, that remains in the hands of the City Council and is “technically still alive,” Murray said.
But the mayor favors KeyArena, and Leiweke made Hansen a very public offer Wednesday as the news cameras rolled.
“If Chris Hansen wants to join us in the NBA, we would like him to be a part owner of the NBA team,” Leiweke said, adding that he hadn’t spoken with the entrepreneur recently. “So Chris, if you want an NBA team this is where it’s going to happen.”
A Hansen spokesman declined to comment, but Hansen spoke at a Civic Cocktail event Wednesday night in Seattle.
According to tweets by The Associated Press’ Tim Booth, Hansen said he would not sue the city for engaging with OVG while he has an MOU, adding, “I’m in for what’s best for Seattle.






Also, according to a tweet by Booth, Hansen was complimentary toward Leiweke but said of the Seattle Center site: “Is this where Seattle wants an arena for next 30 years?”
 
 
Bonderman has been a minority owner of the Boston Celtics NBA team for more than a decade, and Bruckheimer is a close acquaintance of NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and has long expressed a desire to become a franchise owner.
 
 






The NBA is believed to be five to 10 years from expansion. But the NHL, which will launch a new Las Vegas franchise this fall, has an imbalance between its Eastern and Western conferences and could even things out by adding a Seattle franchise.
Bonderman, 74, is a University of Washington graduate and a longtime friend of Mariners owner John Stanton.
He is the chairman of buyout firm TPG Capital and is listed by Forbes as having a net worth of $2.5 billion. Representatives of the Mariners, Seahawks and Sounders attended Wednesday’s news conference.
Bruckheimer, 73, had an estimated net worth of $900 million, according to Forbes in 2015. He has produced blockbuster films such as “Top Gun,” “Beverly Hills Cop,” “Flashdance” and “Pirates of the Caribbean.”
He was described a decade ago in Hollywood’s Deadline magazine as the NHL’s “Ultimate Mr. Showbiz’’ given his “ice hockey obsession” and longstanding desire to own a franchise.
This isn’t the first time Bonderman and Bruckheimer have teamed on a sports venture. In 2007, Bonderman was an “equal partner” in a bid group formed by frontman Bruckheimer and MGM studios chairman Harry Evans Sloan that looked into bringing an NHL expansion franchise to Las Vegas.






The group bowed out in 2010, citing the economic recession that devastated the Las Vegas real-estate market.
Bruckheimer also looked into buying the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2006 before a group led by Mario Lemieux purchased the team out of bankruptcy protection and kept it in place.
But Bruckheimer has remained close with top NHL leadership, including Bettman, frequently appearing at celebrity events at the All-Star Game and throughout the year.
Bettman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2009 that he considers Bruckheimer a good friend and thinks he would make a terrific league owner.
Documents released by the city of Seattle on Wednesday show that an executive-review team and other advisers were impressed by OVG’s financial capacity even before Bonderman and Bruckheimer were brought aboard.
In an interview before Wednesday’s event, Murray predicted the new additions would net Seattle an NHL team before an NBA team.






“I believe the NBA has been pretty clear that their owners have a pretty good TV contract that, financially, they don’t want to break up at this point,” he said,
Eventually, the mayor added, “I think both of them will be here.”
Murray said the city’s focus moving ahead will be on better integrating the OVG proposal within the surrounding neighborhood and ironing out certain financial details — such as parking revenue and tax requests — to better protect taxpayers.
 
He said stakeholder opposition from other pro teams in Sodo likely would make it difficult for the council to approve advancing Hansen’s project unless a binding event-scheduling deal can be obtained.
The Port of Seattle also has been outspoken in opposing the Sodo project, citing traffic and freight-mobility concerns.
“It is a proposal where there is significant opposition from some of the other neighbors down there,” Murray said. “And it has to be worked out.’’
Bonderman would have to divest his Celtics shares were he to become an NBA owner at KeyArena. For now he will focus on getting the KeyArena rebuild going and helping bring the NHL here first.
Bonderman and Bruckheimer join other OVG equity partners Madison Square Garden Co., Live Nation and Delaware North — a concessions company founded by Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs — to help supply project funding.

Early life and education[edit]
Bonderman was born to a Jewish family,[2] in Los Angeles on November 27, 1942, and was educated there at University High School.[3] Bonderman studied at the University of Washington and at Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1966 and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington in 1963. He was also a member of the Harvard Law Review and a Sheldon Fellow. While at or shortly after his time at Harvard, he traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to study Islamic Legal Jurisprudence and Law, and became proficient in various Islamic legal cliques developing a near-native fluency in Modern Standard Arabic. Later, Bonderman developed the Bonderman Fellows program at the University of Washington providing undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for unstructured international travel and study.
Career history[edit]
Bonderman was an assistant professor at Tulane University Law School during 1967 and 1968; he then was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General during 1968 and 1969.[4] In 1971, he joined the law firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C.,[5] where he became a partner and specialized in corporate, securities, bankruptcy and antitrust litigation.[4] In 1983, he joined the Robert M. Bass Group, Inc. (RMBG),[5] which now does business as Keystone Inc., and become the chief operating officer.[4] Bonderman has been a principal at TPG Capital in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 1992, where he is also co-founder and chairman.[4]
In 2008, Bonderman was named as one of the investors of what became the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.[6]
Bonderman is a director of Continental Airlines, Inc., Böwe Bell & Howell Co., Ducati Motorcycles S.P.A., Credicom Asia, the National Education Corp., Beringer Wine Estates, Carr Realty Co., Virgin Cinemas, Ltd., CoStar Group, Inc., GemAlto N.V., Ryanair Holdings, Inc. and Ryanair, Ltd. He has been the chairman of Ryanair Holdings and Ryanair Limited since December 1996.[7] He is on the boards of The Wilderness Society, the Grand Canyon Trust, the World Wildlife Fund, The University of Washington Foundation and the American Himalayan Foundation. He previously served on the boards of Washington Mutual, Inc., American Savings Bank, Denbury Resources, Inc. and Burger King Holdings, Inc. He was a board member of Uber until he resigned from that position in June 2017.[8]
On June 13, 2017, Bonderman resigned from the Uber board amidst controversy surrounding a sexist response to fellow board member Arianna Huffington during a company all-hands meeting.[9] "There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board," said Huffington. Bonderman replied, "actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking." The Uber meeting was, among other things, slated to discuss efforts to reign in a toxic and sexist culture at the company.[10][11][12]
Personal life[edit]
Bonderman is married to Dr. Laurie Michaels;[13] they have five children, and live in Fort Worth, Texas.[1]
In 2002, for his 60th birthday, Bonderman had The Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his birthday party at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. John Mellencamp played for an hour, The Rolling Stones played for an hour and a half, and comedian Robin Williams entertained guests between acts. The party cost $7 million, making it one of the most expensive private concerts ever held.[14]
In 2012, for his 70th birthday party, Bonderman held a private concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney at Wynn Las Vegas for 1020 guests. Robin Williams also performed a comedy routine. Bonderman donated $1000 to each guest's charity of choice.[15]

Early life and education[edit]
Bonderman was born to a Jewish family,[2] in Los Angeles on November 27, 1942, and was educated there at University High School.[3] Bonderman studied at the University of Washington and at Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1966 and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington in 1963. He was also a member of the Harvard Law Review and a Sheldon Fellow. While at or shortly after his time at Harvard, he traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to study Islamic Legal Jurisprudence and Law, and became proficient in various Islamic legal cliques developing a near-native fluency in Modern Standard Arabic. Later, Bonderman developed the Bonderman Fellows program at the University of Washington providing undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for unstructured international travel and study.
Career history[edit]
Bonderman was an assistant professor at Tulane University Law School during 1967 and 1968; he then was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General during 1968 and 1969.[4] In 1971, he joined the law firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C.,[5] where he became a partner and specialized in corporate, securities, bankruptcy and antitrust litigation.[4] In 1983, he joined the Robert M. Bass Group, Inc. (RMBG),[5] which now does business as Keystone Inc., and become the chief operating officer.[4] Bonderman has been a principal at TPG Capital in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 1992, where he is also co-founder and chairman.[4]
In 2008, Bonderman was named as one of the investors of what became the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.[6]
Bonderman is a director of Continental Airlines, Inc., Böwe Bell & Howell Co., Ducati Motorcycles S.P.A., Credicom Asia, the National Education Corp., Beringer Wine Estates, Carr Realty Co., Virgin Cinemas, Ltd., CoStar Group, Inc., GemAlto N.V., Ryanair Holdings, Inc. and Ryanair, Ltd. He has been the chairman of Ryanair Holdings and Ryanair Limited since December 1996.[7] He is on the boards of The Wilderness Society, the Grand Canyon Trust, the World Wildlife Fund, The University of Washington Foundation and the American Himalayan Foundation. He previously served on the boards of Washington Mutual, Inc., American Savings Bank, Denbury Resources, Inc. and Burger King Holdings, Inc. He was a board member of Uber until he resigned from that position in June 2017.[8]
On June 13, 2017, Bonderman resigned from the Uber board amidst controversy surrounding a sexist response to fellow board member Arianna Huffington during a company all-hands meeting.[9] "There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board," said Huffington. Bonderman replied, "actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking." The Uber meeting was, among other things, slated to discuss efforts to reign in a toxic and sexist culture at the company.[10][11][12]
Personal life[edit]
Bonderman is married to Dr. Laurie Michaels;[13] they have five children, and live in Fort Worth, Texas.[1]
In 2002, for his 60th birthday, Bonderman had The Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his birthday party at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. John Mellencamp played for an hour, The Rolling Stones played for an hour and a half, and comedian Robin Williams entertained guests between acts. The party cost $7 million, making it one of the most expensive private concerts ever held.[14]
In 2012, for his 70th birthday party, Bonderman held a private concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney at Wynn Las Vegas for 1020 guests. Robin Williams also performed a comedy routine. Bonderman donated $1000 to each guest's charity of choice.[15]

Early life and education[edit]
Bonderman was born to a Jewish family,[2] in Los Angeles on November 27, 1942, and was educated there at University High School.[3] Bonderman studied at the University of Washington and at Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1966 and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington in 1963. He was also a member of the Harvard Law Review and a Sheldon Fellow. While at or shortly after his time at Harvard, he traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to study Islamic Legal Jurisprudence and Law, and became proficient in various Islamic legal cliques developing a near-native fluency in Modern Standard Arabic. Later, Bonderman developed the Bonderman Fellows program at the University of Washington providing undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for unstructured international travel and study.
Career history[edit]
Bonderman was an assistant professor at Tulane University Law School during 1967 and 1968; he then was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General during 1968 and 1969.[4] In 1971, he joined the law firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C.,[5] where he became a partner and specialized in corporate, securities, bankruptcy and antitrust litigation.[4] In 1983, he joined the Robert M. Bass Group, Inc. (RMBG),[5] which now does business as Keystone Inc., and become the chief operating officer.[4] Bonderman has been a principal at TPG Capital in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 1992, where he is also co-founder and chairman.[4]
In 2008, Bonderman was named as one of the investors of what became the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.[6]
Bonderman is a director of Continental Airlines, Inc., Böwe Bell & Howell Co., Ducati Motorcycles S.P.A., Credicom Asia, the National Education Corp., Beringer Wine Estates, Carr Realty Co., Virgin Cinemas, Ltd., CoStar Group, Inc., GemAlto N.V., Ryanair Holdings, Inc. and Ryanair, Ltd. He has been the chairman of Ryanair Holdings and Ryanair Limited since December 1996.[7] He is on the boards of The Wilderness Society, the Grand Canyon Trust, the World Wildlife Fund, The University of Washington Foundation and the American Himalayan Foundation. He previously served on the boards of Washington Mutual, Inc., American Savings Bank, Denbury Resources, Inc. and Burger King Holdings, Inc. He was a board member of Uber until he resigned from that position in June 2017.[8]
On June 13, 2017, Bonderman resigned from the Uber board amidst controversy surrounding a sexist response to fellow board member Arianna Huffington during a company all-hands meeting.[9] "There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board," said Huffington. Bonderman replied, "actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking." The Uber meeting was, among other things, slated to discuss efforts to reign in a toxic and sexist culture at the company.[10][11][12]
Personal life[edit]
Bonderman is married to Dr. Laurie Michaels;[13] they have five children, and live in Fort Worth, Texas.[1]
In 2002, for his 60th birthday, Bonderman had The Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his birthday party at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. John Mellencamp played for an hour, The Rolling Stones played for an hour and a half, and comedian Robin Williams entertained guests between acts. The party cost $7 million, making it one of the most expensive private concerts ever held.[14]
In 2012, for his 70th birthday party, Bonderman held a private concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney at Wynn Las Vegas for 1020 guests. Robin Williams also performed a comedy routine. Bonderman donated $1000 to each guest's charity of choice.[15]

 Uber board member David Bonderman resigns after making sexist remark at all-hands meeting | The Tech Portal                FacebookTwitterGoogle+  FacebookTwitterGoogle+   AppsCloudCodeConsumer TechCultureGadgetsEnterpriseFuturismInternetScienceSTROKE    Culture NewsUber board member David Bonderman resigns after making sexist remark at all-hands meeting1 month agoAnmol Sachdeva  While Uber has been trying to battle the sexist and misogynistic environment at their workplace, one of its board members named David Bonderman decided it was simply okay to crack a joke about women at their all-hands meeting yesterday. This immediately spurred outrage against the incompetent approach of the company towards fixing its culture.Thus, moments later, Bonderman has resigned from the board of directors to not harm the company’s ongoing efforts to better the internal gender biasing. Uber was accused of workplace sexual harassment by a former female engineer a couple months back. The said remarks were backed by others within the rid-hailing giant and Uber called for an independent investigation into the situation, who’s results and recommendations have been made public today. bonderman statement pic.twitter.com/JnP935pq3T — ಠ_ಠ (@MikeIsaac) June 14, 2017This development was first reported by the New York Times, where Bonderman himself confirmed his decision before releasing an official statement. He states that he was reckless and not thinking straight when he made the snark comment about women on stage at the meeting, which had been organized to assure the company’s employees of the opposite. Talking about his inexcusable actions in an email statement, Bonderman mentions:Today at Uber’s all-hands meeting, I directed a comment to my colleague and friend Arianna Huffington that was careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable. The comment came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended, but I understand the destructive effect it had, and I take full responsibility for that.The said action has spiraled down after an audio recording of the meeting, as reported earlier, revealed that Bonderman made an inexcusable comment about the increase in female representation on the board. He said that adding more women to the board is going to only lead to more talking — an utterly sexist statement that was said to Huffington Post founder and fellow board member Arianna Huffington. Further, talking about his departure, he continues to add:I do not want my comments to create distraction as Uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud. Uber is examining the issues with its culture, and making significant changes and working to right what has been done wrong, which is extremely important for the future of the company.Speaking of his decision to depart Uber, Arianna Huffington in a statement said,I appreciate David doing the right thing for Uber at this time of critical cultural changes at the company.Uber has recently been marred with intense troubles, which kicked off with the sexual harassment allegations and have now caught up to the company. It has also been accused of tracking Lyft drivers, debarring local regulators from using its platform, CEO Travis Kalanick getting into an argument with an UberBlack driver and its embroiling lawsuit with Google’s self-driving unit Waymo.As for the outcome of Holder’s investigation, Uber has let go around twenty employees including Kalanick’s second-in-command and Senior VP of Business, Emil Michael. Even the chief executive has decided to take a leave of absence, due to some recent tragic events, handing over the responsibilities of the $68 billion ride-hailing giant to his highly competent staff members.Anmol SachdevaA hands-on guy fascinated by new apps, technologies and enterprise products.[email protected] TagsDavid Bonderman featured uber uber board uber sexism You may also like     Culture NewsUber in more trouble with a new driver molestation lawsuit3 weeks agoAshvita AnandThings continue to worsen for Uber, as it gets embroiled in yet another lawsuit.

SAN FRANCISCO — David Bonderman, an Uber board member and partner at private equity firm TPG, resigned from the board of the ride-hailing company after he made a disparaging remark about women at an Uber meeting on Tuesday.Earlier in the day at an Uber staff meeting to discuss the company’s culture, Arianna Huffington, another board member, talked about how one woman on a board often leads to more women joining a board.“Actually, what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking,” Mr. Bonderman responded.Attendees were aghast at the exchange, especially at a time when Uber has been trying to overcome a series of scandals over corporate misbehavior, including sexual harassment claims. The company on Tuesday released a 13-page document outlining recommendations it planned to adopt to bring more accountability to executives at Uber for their actions and to increase board oversight. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, also said he would take a leave of absence from the company.

After the staff meeting, employees angry at Mr. Bonderman’s remarks sent numerous emails to their managers and to Liane Hornsey, Uber’s head of human resources, according to people with knowledge of the situation, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential.

Mr. Bonderman quickly apologized for his remark. People close to him said his resignation from the board was swiftly decided to demonstrate to Uber employees that he wanted to adhere to the standards he spoke about in the staff meeting.“I appreciate David doing the right thing for Uber at this time of critical cultural changes at the company,” Ms. Huffington said in a statement. 



                How Uber’s Brash Approach Backfired            

                A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder.            











Mr. Bonderman joined Uber’s board because TPG is an investor in the ride-hailing company. For the past few months, he had been working on Uber’s culture. In a statement, he said his comment “came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended, but I understand the destructive effect it had, and I take full responsibility for that.”Mr. Bonderman added: “I do not want my comments to create distraction as Uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud. I need to hold myself to the same standards that we’re asking Uber to adopt. Therefore, I have decided to resign from Uber’s board of directors, effective tomorrow morning.”Mr. Bonderman’s board seat at Uber may not be vacant for long. As a major stakeholder in Uber, TPG will most likely keep the seat and is discussing who may fill the position.

Mr. Bonderman’s original comments, according to experts, also lack merit.Tali Mendelberg, professor of politics at Princeton University, and Christopher Karpowitz, an associate professor of political science at Brigham Young University, conducted a study in 2012 concluding that men talked far more than women did at meetings. The professors convened 94 groups of five people and varied the number of men and women in the groups. Their study is in line with multiple others drawing similar conclusions — men talk more than women, and men interrupt more than women.“The study shows that men will dominate the conversation if there are more men than women in the group, and they dominate by a lot,” Ms. Mendelberg said in an interview. “When you have just two women in the group, those women are much more silent than men are.”Uber’s board of directors was composed entirely of men until 2016, when Ms. Huffington gained a seat. This week Uber said another woman had been added to the board: Wan Ling Martello, the executive vice president of Nestle in Asia.In an email to employees late Tuesday about Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Kalanick wrote, “Board and management leadership is our highest priority and over the coming weeks and months we will be adding strong independent board members.”

But Ms. Mendelberg warned that it will take more than a few appointments to change the company’s board dynamics. “Simply going from one woman to two women is going to do nothing to women’s voice or influence,” she said.

 Correction: June 28, 2017  
An article on June 14 about the investor David Bonderman’s resignation from Uber’s board misidentified the region for which Wan Ling Martello, another board member, is the executive vice president at Nestle. It is Asia, not South Asia.

Uber's Ex-Communications Chief on Kalanick Taking Leave




TPG Capital co-founder David Bonderman has resigned from the board of Uber Technologies Inc. after uttering a sexist comment during a meeting intended to address rampant internal gender bias.The billionaire co-founder of the private equity firm apologized for cracking a joke during a charged company-wide meeting to discuss sweeping changes meant to curb discrimination and other cultural problems. Bonderman cut in when fellow board member Arianna Huffington was speaking about how the presence of a woman on the board was likely to attract other females.“There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,” Huffington said, according to a person who heard the exchange but was not authorized to discuss it.




“Actually, what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking,” Bonderman said. Among the Uber employees in the room, there were audible gasps and blank stares, according to another person at the meeting.Uber and TPG confirmed the resignation of Bonderman, 74, who founded TPG in 1992 with Jim Coulter and has served as its chairman since 2014. He’s also on the board of real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Inc., Kite Pharma Inc., Ryanair Holdings Plc and almost 20 other companies.The billionaire couldn’t have picked a worse setting to interrupt a woman with a comment about how women talk. He, Huffington and other executives were addressing employees to assure them that Uber would be implementing a litany of recommendations from an independent investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. The entire process was sparked by a February blog post from former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, who detailed allegations of sexism and sexual harassment at the company. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick said Tuesday he will take a leave of absence. And former senior vice president for business Emil Michael was ousted.“Today at Uber’s all-hands meeting, I directed a comment to my colleague and friend Arianna Huffington that was careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable,” Bonderman wrote in an emailed statement. “The comment came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended, but I understand the destructive effect it had, and I take full responsibility for that.”After the meeting, Bonderman apologized personally to Huffington, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak about it. The Huffington Post founder said in a statement later that her fellow director was “doing the right thing.”




“I do not want my comments to create distraction as Uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud,” Bonderman said in his statement. “Uber is examining the issues with its culture, and making significant changes and working to right what has been done wrong, which is extremely important for the future of the company.”

Uber adds a new board member to replace the one who resigned after making a sexist comment at a company meeting

  Uber may have just lost its CEO, but it now has a new board
  member. 

  The ride-hailing company, reeling after CEO Travis Kalanick's
  resignation Tuesday late night PT, is adding TPG investor David
  Trujillo to its board, according to people familiar with the
  matter. Trujilo will fill the gap left when TPG's previous
  representative on the board, David Bonderman, resigned
  after making a sexist comment. 

  Bloomberg and 
  Recode first reported the news.

  Trujillo led TPG's investment in Uber, although Bonderman
  took the board seat for the private equity firm.

  Bonderman's tenure came to an abrupt end last week.





  During a company-wide discussion about the steps Uber planned to
  take to address complaints about sexism and gender discrimination
  in its ranks, company director Ariana Huffington announced
  Wan Ling Martello, a Nestlé
  executive, would be joining Uber's board, upping
  the representation of women there.

  "There's a lot of data that shows when there's one woman on the
  board it's much more likely that there will be a second woman on
  the board," Huffington said, according to a recording of the
  meeting 
  obtained by Yahoo Finance.

  Bonderman 
  responded by saying, "Actually, what it shows is that it's
  much more likely to be more talking."

  He apologized soon after making the statement, which played on a
  stereotype that women talk too much, but seemed to recognize
  later that an apology wasn't enough.

  Uber has been contending with a series of scandals since a former
  engineer 
  published a blog post accusing the company of widespread
  gender discrimination and saying it did nothing in response to
  her complaints that a manager sexually harassed her.

  The ride-hailing company didn't respond to request for
  comment Trujillo joining its board.

  Trujillo's addition to Uber's board will fill one of its several
  empty slots. Among other positions, the board is still searching
  for an independent chairman.

  One position that's not open on the board is Travis Kalanick's.
  Kalanick remains an Uber director, despite his 
  resignation as CEO on Tuesday.

David Bonderman quits Uber board after sexist joke

David Bonderman, founder of private equity group TPG, has quit the board of Uber after making a sexist joke at a company meeting, adding to the turmoil at the top of the company after chief executive Travis Kalanick took a leave of absence. 
Mr Bonderman is also chairman of Ryanair’s board.
Uber is trying to overhaul a corporate culture known for being aggressive and sexist, and drafted in former US attorney-general Eric Holder to report on the ride-hailing company’s failings and recommend changes.
But at a company-wide meeting on Tuesday to discuss the report’s proposals, it took less than seven minutes before Mr Bonderman (74) interrupted fellow board member Arianna Huffington. 
As Ms Huffington was telling staff that research showed boards with one female director were more likely to appoint a second, Mr Bonderman interjected: “Actually, what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking.”
Ms Huffington laughed awkwardly and said it would be his turn to talk soon. After the meeting, Mr Bonderman emailed Uber employees to apologise – and later announced he was resigning from the board.
Standards
“I need to hold myself to the same standards that we’re asking Uber to adopt,” he said in a statement. “I do not want my comments to create distraction.”
The incident underscores the uphill battle Uber faces as it seeks a cultural reboot following a series of crises ranging from allegations of sexual harassment, to a lawsuit over self-driving tech, to revelations about Greyball, software it used to mislead regulators.
It has been a dramatic fall from grace for a company that is still Silicon Valley’s most successful start-up, with a record-setting $68 billion valuation.
Uber executives and board members on Tuesday vowed to set the company on a track that would restore its image.



“We are in a reputational deficit,” admitted board member Bill Gurley. “It is going to take us a while to get out of this.”

Ms Huffington struck a slightly more optimistic note: “Today is the end of this investigation and the end of this process, and the beginning of building an Uber that puts people first,” she said.
The process of rethinking governance and culture began just as Mr Kalanick, 40, announced an indefinite leave of absence – leaving a leaderless group of 14 senior executives in charge. The report’s top recommendation was to reduce Mr Kalanick’s responsibilities and hire a chief operating officer, a role Uber has been trying to fill since March.
The prospect of 14 drivers taking the wheel has raised concerns among shareholders that the arrangement will perpetuate the management chaos sparked by the departures of many top executives.
“The value destruction continues,” complained one shareholder. “Management by a committee of grossly unprepared executives is a recipe for disaster.”
Part of the problem is the ambiguity of Mr Kalanick’s role. As a major shareholder and chief executive since Uber’s early days, he plans to remain involved in key strategic decisions and leadership appointments.
Departure
However, his departure also presents an opportunity for an incoming chief operating officer and new board chairman to play a much bigger role in reshaping the company.
The chief operating officer search was launched in March after Mr Kalanick said he needed leadership help – an admission prompted by an embarrassing video of him yelling at an Uber driver. But with Mr Kalanick now on leave, the chief operating officer search has turned into something more like a chief executive search.
The recent executive departures have all but wiped clean the slate of Uber’s earliest employees, particularly the exit of Emil Michael, a close confidante of Mr Kalanick’s who was ousted on Monday. The company is currently looking to fill the roles of chief financial officer, chief marketing officer, head of engineering and general counsel.
Uber’s board hopes the new hires will set a new tone. “This company has been run as if it was a small start-up,” said Mr Bonderman to employees. “But now it is not. It has to have training programmes; it has to have appropriate oversight.”
Lack of oversight and poor governance was a key theme running through the findings of the report by Mr Holder and his colleague Tammy Albarran. 
Their 47 recommendations reveal gaping holes in Uber’s governance structures and human resources practices.
Uber now is preparing to appoint an independent board chairman, establish a performance review system for leaders, and change its cultural values. It will also adopt a zero-tolerance policy for substantiated complaints of discrimination and harassment – an indirect admission that previously such complaints had been ignored.
Many of the recommendations seem obvious, from goals and performance reviews to rules on alcohol consumption at work and a ban on sex with colleagues in a direct-report relationship.
“The spoiled brats of Silicon Valley don’t know the basics,” said Vivek Wadwha, a fellow at the Rock Centre of Corporate Governance and the co-author of Innovating Women. “It is a revelation for Silicon Valley: ‘Duh, you have to have HR people, you can’t sleep with each other . . . you have to be respectful’.”
Corporate culture
The corporate culture under Mr Kalanick was marked by a willingness to skirt boundaries and ignore rules, an approach that helped fuel Uber’s rapid initial growth but has subsequently backfired.
“This is a company where there has been no line that you wouldn’t cross if it got in the way of success,” said Hadi Partovi, an Uber investor and tech entrepreneur.



The impact of that culture and lack of oversight was highlighted last week, when an investigation into more than 200 complaints of harassment and inappropriate behaviour resulted in the firing of 20 employees.
While many Silicon Valley start-ups experience growing pains, few have been quite as public as Uber’s. As Uber sets out to try to incorporate the basic tenets of corporate governance, a key question will be whether Mr Kalanick can really keep his hands off of the start-up he spent the last eight years building.
In an email to employees, he said he would take time “to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team”.
If all goes as planned, when he does come back it will be to a company that is radically different, and where he will play a very different role. – ( Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)

Shareholder activism has expanded well beyond the stereotypical irate hedge fund manager, pounding his fists on the table for corporate changes. Mutual funds have started agitating publicly, as have pension funds. And on Friday, even a prominent family stepped into the ring.Wildcat Capital — which manages $1.79 billion for David Bonderman, the founding partner of the private equity firm TPG Capital, and his family – is seeking a corporate-governance overhaul at Sorrento Therapeutics, a developer of cancer treatments based in San Diego. The stock of Sorrrento, a biotech company, has plummeted more than 75 percent since July, to a $220 million market valuation.The move is an uncommon one for a family office, which is a professional investment manager for a wealthy family. Given that such offices do not manage outside capital as a hedge fund or mutual fund would, and that they deal with the finances of billionaires, their activities are often private.Wildcat Capital, which owns 2.5 million shares, or 6.5 percent, of Sorrento, took that rare step on Friday, calling out “egregious” actions undertaken by Sorrento’s management and board in a letter it publicized. The family office, led by Leonard A. Potter, demanded that the board fire Sorrento’s chief executive, put a halt to the remainder of a private placement, appoint three new directors and hire an investment banker to help sell the company.

As activism has spread to almost every corner of investing over the last few years, a few family offices have felt so emboldened. This year in London, for example, Western Gate Private Investments, the family office for the Portuguese physicist Luis Amaral, began demanding management changes at Stock Spirits, a vodka maker.

In his long letter to Sorrento’s board on Thursday, Mr. Potter, the president and chief investment officer of Wildcat, explained the actions that led him to take his first activist stance.Sorrento was transferring assets into various subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries then issued “significant amounts” of stock options and warrants, some with higher-priority voting privileges, to a select group of executives and board members, according to the letter. “This series of transactions appears to be little more than a looting of the company assets,” Mr. Potter said.

Mr. Potter also criticized Sorrento’s licensing and investment strategies, which have prevented the company from gaining control or influence in those situations. Sorrento also engaged in a private placement of as much as $150 million worth of shares with two groups of Asian investors, which could represent 45 percent of the company’s outstanding shares. Mr. Potter said that investors did not receive sufficient disclosure related to this transaction and that it diluted the holdings of existing shareholders.As a result, Mr. Potter called for the immediate termination of Henry Ji, the chief executive of Sorrento, and asked that the company halt the portion of the private placement that has not yet been issued. The letter also requested that the board appoint three directors nominated by Wildcat, create a committee to find an interim chief executive and hire a banker to sell the company.“We are not activists – in fact, we tried to be constructive and offered our assistance to Dr. Ji,” said Mr. Potter in an emailed statement. “However, after being rebuffed and seeing the continuing actions of Dr. Ji and the board, we felt it was necessary to take this step immediately in order to protect and maximize shareholder value.”Kevin M. Herde, chief financial officer at Sorrento, declined to comment on the Wildcat Capital letter.Sorrento shares plummeted more than 15 percent to about $5.50 on Friday, almost half the price at which Wildcat Capital acquired them last May. Wildcat is the second-largest investor in Sorrento after the Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation. Continue reading the main story

Early life and education[edit]
Bonderman was born to a Jewish family,[2] in Los Angeles on November 27, 1942, and was educated there at University High School.[3] Bonderman studied at the University of Washington and at Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1966 and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington in 1963. He was also a member of the Harvard Law Review and a Sheldon Fellow. While at or shortly after his time at Harvard, he traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to study Islamic Legal Jurisprudence and Law, and became proficient in various Islamic legal cliques developing a near-native fluency in Modern Standard Arabic. Later, Bonderman developed the Bonderman Fellows program at the University of Washington providing undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for unstructured international travel and study.
Career history[edit]
Bonderman was an assistant professor at Tulane University Law School during 1967 and 1968; he then was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General during 1968 and 1969.[4] In 1971, he joined the law firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C.,[5] where he became a partner and specialized in corporate, securities, bankruptcy and antitrust litigation.[4] In 1983, he joined the Robert M. Bass Group, Inc. (RMBG),[5] which now does business as Keystone Inc., and become the chief operating officer.[4] Bonderman has been a principal at TPG Capital in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 1992, where he is also co-founder and chairman.[4]
In 2008, Bonderman was named as one of the investors of what became the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.[6]
Bonderman is a director of Continental Airlines, Inc., Böwe Bell & Howell Co., Ducati Motorcycles S.P.A., Credicom Asia, the National Education Corp., Beringer Wine Estates, Carr Realty Co., Virgin Cinemas, Ltd., CoStar Group, Inc., GemAlto N.V., Ryanair Holdings, Inc. and Ryanair, Ltd. He has been the chairman of Ryanair Holdings and Ryanair Limited since December 1996.[7] He is on the boards of The Wilderness Society, the Grand Canyon Trust, the World Wildlife Fund, The University of Washington Foundation and the American Himalayan Foundation. He previously served on the boards of Washington Mutual, Inc., American Savings Bank, Denbury Resources, Inc. and Burger King Holdings, Inc. He was a board member of Uber until he resigned from that position in June 2017.[8]
On June 13, 2017, Bonderman resigned from the Uber board amidst controversy surrounding a sexist response to fellow board member Arianna Huffington during a company all-hands meeting.[9] "There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board," said Huffington. Bonderman replied, "actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking." The Uber meeting was, among other things, slated to discuss efforts to reign in a toxic and sexist culture at the company.[10][11][12]
Personal life[edit]
Bonderman is married to Dr. Laurie Michaels;[13] they have five children, and live in Fort Worth, Texas.[1]
In 2002, for his 60th birthday, Bonderman had The Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his birthday party at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. John Mellencamp played for an hour, The Rolling Stones played for an hour and a half, and comedian Robin Williams entertained guests between acts. The party cost $7 million, making it one of the most expensive private concerts ever held.[14]
In 2012, for his 70th birthday party, Bonderman held a private concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney at Wynn Las Vegas for 1020 guests. Robin Williams also performed a comedy routine. Bonderman donated $1000 to each guest's charity of choice.[15]

On June 13, 2017, Bonderman resigned from the Uber board amidst controversy surrounding a sexist response to fellow board member Arianna Huffington during a company all-hands meeting.[9] "There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board," said Huffington. Bonderman replied, "actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking." The Uber meeting was, among other things, slated to discuss efforts to reign in a toxic and sexist culture at the company.[10][11][12]
Personal life[edit]
Bonderman is married to Dr. Laurie Michaels;[13] they have five children, and live in Fort Worth, Texas.[1]
In 2002, for his 60th birthday, Bonderman had The Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his birthday party at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. John Mellencamp played for an hour, The Rolling Stones played for an hour and a half, and comedian Robin Williams entertained guests between acts. The party cost $7 million, making it one of the most expensive private concerts ever held.[14]
In 2012, for his 70th birthday party, Bonderman held a private concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney at Wynn Las Vegas for 1020 guests. Robin Williams also performed a comedy routine. Bonderman donated $1000 to each guest's charity of choice.[15]

Early life and education[edit]
Bonderman was born to a Jewish family,[2] in Los Angeles on November 27, 1942, and was educated there at University High School.[3] Bonderman studied at the University of Washington and at Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1966 and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington in 1963. He was also a member of the Harvard Law Review and a Sheldon Fellow. While at or shortly after his time at Harvard, he traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to study Islamic Legal Jurisprudence and Law, and became proficient in various Islamic legal cliques developing a near-native fluency in Modern Standard Arabic. Later, Bonderman developed the Bonderman Fellows program at the University of Washington providing undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for unstructured international travel and study.
Career history[edit]
Bonderman was an assistant professor at Tulane University Law School during 1967 and 1968; he then was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General during 1968 and 1969.[4] In 1971, he joined the law firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C.,[5] where he became a partner and specialized in corporate, securities, bankruptcy and antitrust litigation.[4] In 1983, he joined the Robert M. Bass Group, Inc. (RMBG),[5] which now does business as Keystone Inc., and become the chief operating officer.[4] Bonderman has been a principal at TPG Capital in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 1992, where he is also co-founder and chairman.[4]
In 2008, Bonderman was named as one of the investors of what became the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.[6]
Bonderman is a director of Continental Airlines, Inc., Böwe Bell & Howell Co., Ducati Motorcycles S.P.A., Credicom Asia, the National Education Corp., Beringer Wine Estates, Carr Realty Co., Virgin Cinemas, Ltd., CoStar Group, Inc., GemAlto N.V., Ryanair Holdings, Inc. and Ryanair, Ltd. He has been the chairman of Ryanair Holdings and Ryanair Limited since December 1996.[7] He is on the boards of The Wilderness Society, the Grand Canyon Trust, the World Wildlife Fund, The University of Washington Foundation and the American Himalayan Foundation. He previously served on the boards of Washington Mutual, Inc., American Savings Bank, Denbury Resources, Inc. and Burger King Holdings, Inc. He was a board member of Uber until he resigned from that position in June 2017.[8]
On June 13, 2017, Bonderman resigned from the Uber board amidst controversy surrounding a sexist response to fellow board member Arianna Huffington during a company all-hands meeting.[9] "There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board," said Huffington. Bonderman replied, "actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking." The Uber meeting was, among other things, slated to discuss efforts to reign in a toxic and sexist culture at the company.[10][11][12]
Personal life[edit]
Bonderman is married to Dr. Laurie Michaels;[13] they have five children, and live in Fort Worth, Texas.[1]
In 2002, for his 60th birthday, Bonderman had The Rolling Stones and John Mellencamp play at his birthday party at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. John Mellencamp played for an hour, The Rolling Stones played for an hour and a half, and comedian Robin Williams entertained guests between acts. The party cost $7 million, making it one of the most expensive private concerts ever held.[14]
In 2012, for his 70th birthday party, Bonderman held a private concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney at Wynn Las Vegas for 1020 guests. Robin Williams also performed a comedy routine. Bonderman donated $1000 to each guest's charity of choice.[15]

Trotz Whitacres harter Hand zerfällt der GM-Verwaltungsrat weiter in zwei Lager - das "old boys network" der alten Kämpfer, die sich noch aus besseren GM-Tagen hinübergerettet haben, aber inzwischen in der Minderheit sind, und die neuen, skrupellosen Aufräumer, auch "Realisten" genannt und von der amerikanischen sowie der kanadischen Regierung bestallt. Stärkste Persönlichkeit bei letzteren ist David Bonderman, der Chef der texanischen Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaft TPG. Der Mann, dessen Aktionen vor vier Jahren persönlich die deutsche "Heuschrecken"-Debatte inspirierten, schert sich mit klassischer Kaltblütigkeit wenig um deutsche Sorgen oder den Erhalt von Arbeitsplätzen als darum, was auf dem nackten Papier rechnerisch am meisten Sinn macht.






Bonderman, der TPG 1992 mitbegründete, ist seit langem eine der einflussreichsten Figuren in der Private-Equity-Branche. Der 66-jährige studierte Jurist hat sich einen Namen gemacht, indem er etliche kränkelnde Konzerne wiederaufpäppelte - notfalls auch mit Kahlschlag. So führte er Continental Airlines aus der Pleite und sorgte in Deutschland mit seiner Brutalsanierung des Armaturenhersteller Grohe in 2005 für Furore. Der damalige SPD-Vizekanzler Franz Müntefering nahm dies zum Anlass für seine scharfe "Heuschrecken"-Kritik.



Die Proteste der deutschen Gewerkschaften gegen die GM-Verhandlungstaktik dürfte Bonderman also wenig stören. Seine Haltung, so Insider: Wenn es sich für GM rechne, Opel zu halten, wäre dies die beste Option.
Die Amerikaner sehen das alles sowieso pragmatischer, dort gilt der in Deutschland angefeindete Bonderman als brillanter Geschäftsmann, der sich zugleich für den Umweltschutz einsetzt, etwa durch sein Engagement für den World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Auf der "Forbes"-Hitliste der 400 reichsten Amerikaner rangiert der globetrottende Texaner derzeit mit einem Privatvermögen von 2,6 Milliarden Dollar auf Platz 161. Er fliegt mit einem Gulfstream-Privatjet durch die Welt, eines seiner Anwesen befindet sich mitten in einem Naturschutzgebiet in den Rocky Mountains. Seinen 60. Geburtstag feierte er mit einer Sieben-Millionen-Dollar-Sause in Las Vegas, bei der die Rolling Stones, John Mellencamp und der Komödiant Robin Williams auftraten.

Das kann man laut sagen.
Zitat von sysopDas Tauziehen um die Zukunft des Autoherstellers Opel dauert an. Das Bild, das die Bundesregierung abgibt, sieht dabei nicht unbedingt vorteilhaft aus. Hat sie sich bei den Verhandlungen zu früh auf den Zulieferer Magna festgelegt?

Die Festlegung auf Magna war keineswegs zu früh, auf jeden Fall aber richtig, weil damit eindeutig die Interessen Deutschlands/Europas vertreten wurden. 

In gleicher Weise haben die USA/GM ihre ureigensten Interessen vertreten.

GB war beleidigt, weil Deutschland nicht auch für Vauxhall 
gerade stehen wollte ( sprich zahlen wollte).

Das einzige 'Entgegenkommen'  der USA gegenüber Deutschland, besser gegenüber  Frau Merkel, besteht wohl darin, dass man die Karten erst nach den BT-Wahlen auf den Tisch legen wird. Man will ja den Wahlsieg von Frau Merkel nicht unnötig gefährden.

was sind das denn für Verhandlungen gewesen.
Durch die frühe Festlegung, man wollte/musste  ja unbedingt vor der Wahl die Lorbeeren einsammeln, hat man sich die Chancen auf vernünftige Preise respektive Staatsbelastung selber verbaut/versaut.

Jetzt muss man mit Magna nehmen was man kriegt. Ist ja wenig bzw. teuer genug, und hier ausführlich abgehandelt worden.

Beamte und Politclowns haben im Tagesgeschäft nichts zu suchen.

Die frühzeitige einseitige Präferenz der deutschen Politik auf das Magna Konsortium war aus meiner Sicht vollkommen unnötig und bei nachhaltiger Betrachtung falsch, da es der deutschen Politik die Flexibilität bzw. weitere Optionen auf eine betriebswirtschaftlich sinnvolle Lösung  unnötiger Weise weitgehend genommen hat.
GM ist Dank der massiven finanziellen Intervention der US Regierung schnell und erstarkt aus der Insolvenz herausgekommen und wird nunmehr der Deutschen Regierung / Opel ihren Wunschkandidaten RHJI aufzwingen.

.....haben sich da beide Parteien der Großen Koalition,  die glaubten bei diesem Thema im Wahlkampf punkten zu können. Schwaches Bild sogar von Merkel und noch mehr von Steinmeier, der glaubte bei Opel den Löwen spielen zu müssen, obwohl ihm das am allerwenigsten liegt. Dabei hat das alles nur etwas mit natürlicher Intelligenz zu tun und die hatte wenigstens in diesm Fall der Herr zu Guttenberg.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
