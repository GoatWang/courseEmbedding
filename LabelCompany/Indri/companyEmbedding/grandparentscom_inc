Great New Products Just for You

New Year, New You
Each year, we resolve to become slightly better versions of ourselves: happier, healthier, more connected to our families and friends. But we all know how difficult it is to stick to those goals, so to help you out, we've rounded up the best products for meeting your New Year's resolutions. Click through to see what's new for 2010.







Eat Healthier: Compact Juice Fountain
One of the easiest ways to get more fruits and vegetables in your diet is to combine a bunch of them in interesting ways, press them through a 700-watt squeezer, then sip through a straw. The Compact Juice Fountain from Breville is your best tool for doing just that, but it isn't a big beastly machine that will monopolize your kitchen counter space.   Price: $99.99 Available at: brevilleusa.com







Get Fit: Stretch Bands
If you haven't hit the gym lately,  it might take more than the turn of a decade to inspire you to run five miles on a treadmill. Playing with rubber bands might not sound at all like a workout, but you'd be surprised by the benefits of using Stretch Bands like these from Valeo. They're a favorite of sports therapists, a staple in many Pilates and yoga classes, and they actually feel good while you're using them. Create an at-home routine from a book of exercises, like Strength Band Training (Human Kinetics, 2004), and resolve to enter a marathon next year.   Price: $15 Available at: amazon.com







Save More Money: Adams Record Ledger
If getting your finances under control is on your list of things to stop putting off this year, start with the first and easiest step — getting all your expenses down on paper. The Adams Record Ledger has columns to track money coming in and money going out, and you see at a glance all the essentials and nonessentials you're spending money on. We could recommend a fancier, leatherbound and gold-embossed ledger, but the high price would defeat the purpose of this resolution.   Price: $18.69 Available at: officemax.com







Manage Stress: Beginners Meditation Kit
You don't have to sweat through hours of intense yoga or spend thousands of dollars on therapy to get your stress in check. Just find a quiet corner of your house, get comfy on this cushion, and begin your introduction to meditation with the Hugger Mugger Beginner's Meditation Kit. Besides the cushion, the set includes a CD, booklet, and soy candle that should get you centered and serene in no time.   Price: $74.95 Available at: huggermugger.com







Make More "Me" Time: Heated Foot Bath
You deserve some pampering, but don't have time for a day at the spa, right? This Aquajet Foot Massage Spa from Brookstone is the closest you can get to a professional, therapeutic foot massage while still being able to watch American Idol at the same time. The water quickly heats to a relaxing 115 degrees, and the powerful jets are solid stand-ins for an acupressure specialist. Unlike cheaper footbaths, this one doesn't make a lot of noise and ruin your time to unwind.   Price: $99.95 Available at: amazon.com







Keep Up Correspondence: Nice Stationery
You reconnected with a distant cousin at your family reunion last year, and you really meant it when you said, "Let's keep in touch!" So do it. This Monogrammed Regent Blue stationery set is made from 100 percent cotton and has a smart, mid-century modern design that should inspire lots of line-dropping. Plus, a handwritten card feels more special than writing on a Facebook  wall.   Price: $92 Available at:  crane.com







Write Your Memoir: Moleskine Notebooks
Brilliant ideas always strike at the least opportune times, like when you're waiting in line at the grocery store or sitting in traffic. And your mental notes never surface when you're finally in front of a blank white page. Moleskine Pocket Ruled Cahiers are the perfect size, lightweight, high-quality notebooks to carry in your back pocket or handbag and scribble your assorted moments of genius (or your grocery list). Now, if you could just find that pen....  Price: $6.50 for a pack of three Available at: creativesoutfitter.com

COULD YOU AFFORD A LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESS?







Almost two-thirds of people don't have enough money saved for emergencies.
That's why the AGA has partnered with Aetna to help protect you in case you or a family member is ever diagnosed with cancer.











Did you know...








Fact #1
1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will get cancer in their lifetime.







Fact #2
There's a 5-10% chance that your children will get cancer if you are diagnosed with it first.







Fact #3
1 in 5 people diagnosed with cancer who have health insurance, use all or most of their savings because of the financial strain of dealing with cancer



Source: The American Cancer Society


The Cost of Cancer


$17,460 the yearly out-of-pocket cost for women with breast cancer


The last thing you want to worry about if you or someone you love is diagnosed with cancer is your financial wellbeing. But the reality is, cancer is expensive.  
61% of the costs associated with cancer are indirect costs that are not covered by insurance and can include:
                        • Deductibles and co-pays
                        • Experimental treatments
                        • Transportation to and from treatments
                        • Medical supplies

Protect yourself and your family with the AGA-endorsed Aetna Critical Care Insurance Policy*, where a lump-sum benefit is paid in-full immediately if you are diagnosed with cancer. Use the money to pay every day expenses like your mortgage or household bills.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree
