Cypress Insurance Company Key Developments

The U.S. District Judge Permanently Dismisses Two Actions Against SimpsonThachers Clients, Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company and Cypress Insurance Company
Jul 7 17
On June 27, 2017, the U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Guilford permanently dismissed two actions against Simpson Thachers clients, Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company and Cypress Insurance Company. The first of the two cases was filed as a putative class action in 2015 in federal court in Los Angeles. The Firm successfully moved to strike the class allegations in that case in 2016, and the second case was filed that same year, also as a putative class action. The plaintiffs in both cases accused the insurers of violating the Stored Communications Act by hacking into the files of workers compensation attorneys. Judge Guilford found that the plaintiffs had not adequately alleged a violation of Stored Communications Act and dismissed the claims with prejudice.
