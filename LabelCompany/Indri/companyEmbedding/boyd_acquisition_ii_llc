 Boyd Gaming Corporation (NASDAQ:BYD) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 On December 15, 2016, Boyd Gaming Corporation (the Company), certain of its subsidiaries and the trustee to the Notes (as defined below) entered into a (i) second supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the Companys 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) and (ii) first supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the Companys 6.375% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and, together with the 2023 Notes, the Notes). The supplemental indentures were entered into to add the following subsidiaries as guarantors to the Notes: Boyd Acquisition I, LLC, Boyd Acquisition II, LLC, Peninsula Gaming, LLC, Belle of Orleans, L.L.C., Diamond Jo, LLC, Diamond Jo Worth, LLC, Kansas Star Casino, LLC, and The Old Evangeline Downs, L.L.C. The foregoing description of the supplemental indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of such supplemental indentures, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, with respect to the supplemental indenture to the 2023 Notes, and 4.2, with respect to the supplemental indenture to the 2026 Notes, and incorporated herein by reference. The indenture and the first supplemental indenture governing the 2023 Notes, which describe the terms of such notes, were included as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on May 21, 2015, and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, which describes the terms of such notes, was included as Exhibit 4.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. Item 8.01. Other Events. The Company is also filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update, as presented in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, the audited consolidated financial statements and certain other items included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 to reflect the impact of the following events:







 On August 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its 50% equity interest in Marina District Development Holding Co., LLC (MDDHC), the parent company of Borgata Hotel Casino Spa (Borgata), to MGM Resorts International (MGM), to the Purchase Agreement entered into on May 31, 2016, as amended on July 19, 2016, by and among the Company, Boyd Atlantic City, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Seller), and MGM. Accordingly, presentation of the Companys equity investment in Borgata and results of Borgata prior to its deconsolidation on September 30, 2014, are now being presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.










 On September 2, 2016, the Peninsula Gaming, LLC, (Peninsula) debt was refinanced, eliminating the financing structure that restricted the Companys ability to transfer cash from Peninsula to Boyd Gaming Corporation. As a result of the elimination of this restriction, the Company has concluded that the properties previously comprising the Peninsula segment have been aggregated into the Midwest and South reportable segment, and the Company has adjusted the presentation for all periods presented.










 On September 2, 2016, the Company notified the trustees of the 2023 Notes and the 2026 Notes of the designation of the following additional subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries: Boyd Acquisition I, LLC, Boyd Acquisition II, LLC, Peninsula Gaming, LLC, Belle of Orleans, L.L.C., Diamond Jo, LLC, Diamond Jo Worth, LLC, Kansas Star Casino, LLC, and The Old Evangeline Downs, L.L.C. The Company has reclassified the information for these entities from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (50% Owned) to Guarantor Subsidiaries for purposes of the condensed consolidating financial information in Note 17 to the Companys financial statements.


 In order to reflect the above, the Company has recast the following portions of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as reflected in exhibit 99.1 hereto:







 Part II. Item 6, Selected Financial Data;










 Part II. Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;










 Part II. Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk;










 Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for the year ended December 31, 2015; and










 Part IV. Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, except that the exhibit index included in sub-Item (a)(3) is not impacted by this Current Report on Form 8-K other than (i) to replace Exhibit 12, Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges, with the updated exhibit of the same name included in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and (ii) to remove Exhibit 99.2.


 The updated historical financial statements, and other conforming changes to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, described above and as filed hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, have been updated solely to include the retrospective adjustments and new footnote disclosure. All other information provided in the Form 10-K, unless otherwise provided   in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, remains unchanged, and this Current Report on Form 8-K does not modify or update the remaining disclosures in the Form 10-K in any other way. You should read this Current Report on Form 8-K in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC. Item 9.01.

 Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 On December 15, 2016, Boyd Gaming Corporation (the Company), certain of its subsidiaries and the trustee to the Notes (as defined below) entered into a (i) second supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the Companys 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) and (ii) first supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the Companys 6.375% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and, together with the 2023 Notes, the Notes). The supplemental indentures were entered into to add the following subsidiaries as guarantors to the Notes: Boyd Acquisition I, LLC, Boyd Acquisition II, LLC, Peninsula Gaming, LLC, Belle of Orleans, L.L.C., Diamond Jo, LLC, Diamond Jo Worth, LLC, Kansas Star Casino, LLC, and The Old Evangeline Downs, L.L.C. The foregoing description of the supplemental indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of such supplemental indentures, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, with respect to the supplemental indenture to the 2023 Notes, and 4.2, with respect to the supplemental indenture to the 2026 Notes, and incorporated herein by reference. The indenture and the first supplemental indenture governing the 2023 Notes, which describe the terms of such notes, were included as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on May 21, 2015, and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, which describes the terms of such notes, was included as Exhibit 4.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. Item 8.01. Other Events. The Company is also filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update, as presented in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, the audited consolidated financial statements and certain other items included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 to reflect the impact of the following events:







 On August 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its 50% equity interest in Marina District Development Holding Co., LLC (MDDHC), the parent company of Borgata Hotel Casino Spa (Borgata), to MGM Resorts International (MGM), to the Purchase Agreement entered into on May 31, 2016, as amended on July 19, 2016, by and among the Company, Boyd Atlantic City, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Seller), and MGM. Accordingly, presentation of the Companys equity investment in Borgata and results of Borgata prior to its deconsolidation on September 30, 2014, are now being presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.










 On September 2, 2016, the Peninsula Gaming, LLC, (Peninsula) debt was refinanced, eliminating the financing structure that restricted the Companys ability to transfer cash from Peninsula to Boyd Gaming Corporation. As a result of the elimination of this restriction, the Company has concluded that the properties previously comprising the Peninsula segment have been aggregated into the Midwest and South reportable segment, and the Company has adjusted the presentation for all periods presented.










 On September 2, 2016, the Company notified the trustees of the 2023 Notes and the 2026 Notes of the designation of the following additional subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries: Boyd Acquisition I, LLC, Boyd Acquisition II, LLC, Peninsula Gaming, LLC, Belle of Orleans, L.L.C., Diamond Jo, LLC, Diamond Jo Worth, LLC, Kansas Star Casino, LLC, and The Old Evangeline Downs, L.L.C. The Company has reclassified the information for these entities from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (50% Owned) to Guarantor Subsidiaries for purposes of the condensed consolidating financial information in Note 17 to the Companys financial statements.


 In order to reflect the above, the Company has recast the following portions of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as reflected in exhibit 99.1 hereto:







 Part II. Item 6, Selected Financial Data;










 Part II. Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;










 Part II. Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk;










 Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for the year ended December 31, 2015; and










 Part IV. Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, except that the exhibit index included in sub-Item (a)(3) is not impacted by this Current Report on Form 8-K other than (i) to replace Exhibit 12, Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges, with the updated exhibit of the same name included in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and (ii) to remove Exhibit 99.2.


 The updated historical financial statements, and other conforming changes to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, described above and as filed hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, have been updated solely to include the retrospective adjustments and new footnote disclosure. All other information provided in the Form 10-K, unless otherwise provided   in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, remains unchanged, and this Current Report on Form 8-K does not modify or update the remaining disclosures in the Form 10-K in any other way. You should read this Current Report on Form 8-K in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (d) Exhibits              Exhibit Number
