Biotricity announces support of progressive changes in telemedicine healthcare policyJuly 18, 2017 | BY BIOTRICITY
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., July 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biotricity Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative, biometric remote monitoring solutions, acknowledges the importance of telemedicine by announcing its support of the proposed changes in healthcare policy and its expansion into healthcare practices. Biotricity believes that the rise of telemedicine at the federal and state levels points to a healthcare shift that promotes remote care delivery. This direction could create opportunities for remote patient monitoring solutions that can be integrated within telemedicine.
The nationwide telehealth coverage bill called the Medicare Telehealth Parity Act of 2017 is one of several new federal bills currently under consideration. Designed to introduce an incremental, though significant, expansion of coverage for telehealth services under the Medicare program, the bipartisan Act is sponsored by Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA), with seven co-sponsors to date. If enacted in its current form, it could modernize the way Medicare reimburses telehealth services by expanding the number of qualifying geographic locations, and expanding coverage of telehealth services. This would all take place in a series of three phases. This bill joins a growing list of telemedicine-friendly legislation on Capitol Hill, including the CONNECT for Health Act of 2017, the CHRONIC Care Act of 2017, the Hallways to Health Act, the Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine (FAST) Act, and the Telehealth Innovation and Improvement Act. At the state level, in May 2017, Texas was the final state to abolish the requirement that patient-physician relationships be established with an in-person visit before implementing telemedicine.
Biotricity’s remote patient monitoring device platform aligns with telemedicine and can be integrated with telehealth solutions. The company’s flagship product, the Bioflux solution, is a remote patient monitoring (RPM) device for physicians to diagnose individuals with cardiovascular disease. The solution could be leveraged through telemedicine to support virtual healthcare delivery for cardiac patients with medically relevant, real-time, data collection and feedback. Biotricity has already begun working with Dr. Nayyar Razvi, an advisor to the Company with substantial experience in telemedicine who has seen over 26,000 patients using this approach. “Remote patient monitoring solutions will help to substantially expand telemedicine use cases. Today, telemedicine is limited in scope because physicians lack complete insight into the patient’s condition. Devices that can transmit medically relevant patient information, such as biometrics, will help provide a more clinically accurate view of the patient,” states Dr. Razvi. “Delivering virtual care so the quality of care remains equivalent or better than a physical visit will be the holy grail of telemedicine, something that will likely be delivered by integrating remote monitoring devices.”
Dr. Razvi has helped drive progress in telemedicine through his work at Sheridan College, where he has put together a degree program for individuals to become a Certified Telemedicine Assistant and at Bayshore, where he helped introduce remote telemedicine for wound care. “Training environments like Sheridan and innovative healthcare organizations like Bayshore are perfect places for testing and integrating solutions like Biotricity’s Bioflux for use in telemedicine,” he explains. “I look forward to working with Biotricity to see how we can leverage their technology in our existing work.”
“The legislative progress towards telemedicine is an excellent driver of health technology innovation and, more importantly, improves patient care for all individuals,” explains Biotricity CEO and Founder Waqaas Al-Siddiq. “With more freedom, integrating telemedicine technologies into healthcare delivery is simplified, driving down costs and facilitating widespread access to care—especially remote care.”

Improving care, reducing costs
The challenge is immense, but so is the opportunity for transformative change that will improve patient outcomes and curb healthcare costs.
More than half of adults in the US suffer from at least one chronic disease, and almost one-third have multiple chronic conditions.3 Seven of the top ten causes of death in the US are chronic diseases,4 with cardiovascular disease alone responsible for 30.8% of all deaths.5
In most cases, these conditions are preventable through lifestyle changes. However, the hard reality, with which doctors contend every day, is that the effects of these conditions often manifest too gradually for people to recognize. It falls to the healthcare system to deal with these diseases after they’ve advanced to a serious stage, often at great financial cost. It was recently estimated that 86% of all healthcare spending in the US goes to the treatment of those with chronic diseases.3
US adults with at least one chronic diseaseNumber of chronic diseases in list of top 10 causes of deathHealthcare dollars spent on chronic diseasesIt is therefore vital to develop technology that enhances doctors’ ability to detect and diagnose these conditions—and to do so early enough for treatments to have their greatest effect. It is also crucial to follow that up with personal devices that provide feedback reinforcing patients’ adherence to doctors’ instructions after diagnosis.
Achieving these twin goals is Biotricity’s mission.
With the development of our Bioflux and Biolife systems, we’re tackling cardiovascular disease. We will move forward from there, applying our proven expertise in remote medical monitoring to the development of professional and personal systems that will aid in the fight against other chronic diseases as well.

Company Overview
Biotricity is a medical technology company committed to improving healthcare by developing solutions that aid chronic disease prevention and management. Biotricity’s premier product is Bioflux, an ECG monitoring system that will be prescribed by physicians to diagnose and remotely monitor cardiac patients.
Biotricity is expanding medical-grade monitoring into the consumer market via its Biolife solution, which empowers users to self-manage chronic conditions. Biolife helps users make lifestyle changes by combining medically relevant ECG data with social media interactivity and a lifestyle log.
Biotricity’s R&D continues to focus on the preventative healthcare market, with a vision of putting health management into the hands of the individual. The company aims to support the self-management of critical and chronic conditions with the use of innovative solutions to ease the growing burden on the healthcare system.
With soaring rates of cardiovascular disease overwhelming the healthcare system, the opportunity is ripe for technology that enables physicians to diagnose and monitor CVD and patients to take their heart health into their own hands. With physicians’ input and our deep knowledge of the industry, we set about creating solutions that bridge the gap in the marketplace between the healthcare system and the people it treats. That’s why we founded Biotricity and continue to focus on R&D to bring technologically advanced solutions to market in order to help physicians diagnose and monitor patients—and help consumers make successful lifestyle changes after initial diagnosis.

Biotricity Announces Support of Progressive Changes in Telemedicine Healthcare Policy
Jul 18, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biotricity Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative, biometric remote monitoring solutions, acknowledges the importance of telemedicine by announcing its support of the proposed changes in healthcare policy and its expansion into healthcare practices. Biotricity believes that the rise of telemedicine at the federal and state levels points to a healthcare shift that promotes remote care delivery. This direction could create opportunities for remote patient monitoring solutions that can be integrated within telemedicine.
The nationwide telehealth coverage bill called the Medicare Telehealth Parity Act of 2017 is one of several new federal bills currently under consideration. Designed to introduce an incremental, though significant, expansion of coverage for telehealth services under the Medicare program, the bipartisan Act is sponsored by Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA), with seven co-sponsors to date. If enacted in its current form, it could modernize the way Medicare reimburses telehealth services by expanding the number of qualifying geographic locations, and expanding coverage of telehealth services. This would all take place in a series of three phases. This bill joins a growing list of telemedicine-friendly legislation on Capitol Hill, including the CONNECT for Health Act of 2017, the CHRONIC Care Act of 2017, the Hallways to Health Act, the Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine (FAST) Act, and the Telehealth Innovation and Improvement Act. At the state level, in May 2017, Texas was the final state to abolish the requirement that patient-physician relationships be established with an in-person visit before implementing telemedicine. Biotricity’s remote patient monitoring device platform aligns with telemedicine and can be integrated with telehealth solutions. The company’s flagship product, the Bioflux solution, is a remote patient monitoring (RPM) device for physicians to diagnose individuals with cardiovascular disease. The solution could be leveraged through telemedicine to support virtual healthcare delivery for cardiac patients with medically relevant, real-time, data collection and feedback. Biotricity has already begun working with Dr. Nayyar Razvi, an advisor to the Company with substantial experience in telemedicine who has seen over 26,000 patients using this approach. “Remote patient monitoring solutions will help to substantially expand telemedicine use cases. Today, telemedicine is limited in scope because physicians lack complete insight into the patient’s condition. Devices that can transmit medically relevant patient information, such as biometrics, will help provide a more clinically accurate view of the patient,” states Dr. Razvi. “Delivering virtual care so the quality of care remains equivalent or better than a physical visit will be the holy grail of telemedicine, something that will likely be delivered by integrating remote monitoring devices.” Dr. Razvi has helped drive progress in telemedicine through his work at Sheridan College, where he has put together a degree program for individuals to become a Certified Telemedicine Assistant and at Bayshore, where he helped introduce remote telemedicine for wound care. “Training environments like Sheridan and innovative healthcare organizations like Bayshore are perfect places for testing and integrating solutions like Biotricity’s Bioflux for use in telemedicine,” he explains. “I look forward to working with Biotricity to see how we can leverage their technology in our existing work.” “The legislative progress towards telemedicine is an excellent driver of health technology innovation and, more importantly, improves patient care for all individuals,” explains Biotricity CEO and Founder Waqaas Al-Siddiq. “With more freedom, integrating telemedicine technologies into healthcare delivery is simplified, driving down costs and facilitating widespread access to care—especially remote care.” About Biotricity Inc.Biotricity is a modern medical technology company focused on delivering innovative, remote biometric monitoring solutions to the medical and consumer markets, including diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for chronic conditions and lifestyle improvement. Biotricity’s R&D continues to focus on the preventative healthcare market, with a vision of putting health management into the hands of the individual. The company aims to support the self-management of critical and chronic conditions with the use of innovative solutions to ease the growing burden on the healthcare system.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE










	Biotricity changes year-end to move closer to qualifying to list on a National Exchange







	REDWOOD CITY, CA  April 25, 2017 

	Biotricity, Inc.


	(BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative, biometric remote monitoring solutions, has changed its year-end as it prepares to get ready to pursue a listing on a national securities exchange such as NYSE:MKT or Nasdaq. As certain national securities exchanges would require at least one full year of audited financials of the Company, this step will fulfill that requirement. There are several additional steps that are required before Biotricity can formally begin the process.  





	Pursuing a national listing is a critical step for the Company because it believes that listing on a national securities exchange will result in greater liquidity, a higher profile, and a larger following among analysts and the public. Given the recent submission of the final 510(k) application for its Bioflux product, Biotricity believes this is the right time to begin this effort. The Company has already engaged Donohoe Advisory to guide them through this process.





	Biotricity founder and CEO Waqaas Al-Siddiq commented, "The Company is incredibly excited about kicking off this initiative. A listing on a national securities exchange is an important step for Biotricity as we prepare to commercialize our first medical solution and help drive awareness around the Company and our remote medical monitoring device.  






	About Biotricity Inc.



	Biotricity is a modern medical technology company focused on delivering innovative, remote biometric monitoring solutions to the medical and consumer markets, including diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for chronic conditions and lifestyle improvement. Biotricitys R&D continues to focus on the preventative healthcare market, with a vision of putting health management into the hands of the individual. The company aims to support the self-management of critical and chronic conditions with the use of innovative solutions to ease the growing burden on the healthcare system.

Biotricity Receives Ethics Approval to Investigate Mobile Wireless Fetal Monitoring
Jun 20, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., June  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biotricity, Inc. (BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative, biometric remote monitoring solutions, today announced it has received ethics approval to conduct a study that will investigate and validate a mobile wireless fetal heart rate variability (HRV) monitor. Achieving ethics approval to conduct a clinical investigation is a significant accomplishment as the responsible institution must review the entire project from design, methodology, risk, goals, and other factors before proceeding.
The study will be conducted at Rockyview General Hospital by Dr. David Liepert, the Director of Quality Assurance and Improvement for Department of Anesthesia, and Dr. Reed Ferber an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Kinesiology and the Director and Chief Scientific Officer of the Running Injury Clinic. Both are accomplished professionals and members of Biotricity’s scientific and medical advisory board. Dr. Reed is a world-recognized expert in sensors and signal processing, and Dr. Liepert’s work with wearable technology, clinical medicine and patient safety will be invaluable as the Company investigates the pre-natal monitoring sphere. About the Study:Early and consistent prenatal care improves the chances of a healthy pregnancy for both mother and child. Prenatal monitoring helps physicians and other caregivers to better control existing conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and help avoid serious complications in pregnancy from other disorders, such as preeclampsia. Regular monitoring reduces the infant’s risk for complications as well, making unforeseeable risks more predictable, manageable and potentially preventable. Mobile, wearable systems for fetal ECG recording will allow for real-time and real-life evaluation of both the baby’s and mother’s status. An electrical sensing ECG monitor provides a higher sampling rate than conventional techniques. This allows for a higher level of heart rate variability processing and automation, which can help differentiate artifacts from the heart rates of both the mother and the baby. This enhanced accuracy could further help save lives and improve the overall quality of prenatal care. “Estimating the heart rate variability pre-birth is a natural progression for Biotricity, whose main goal in this sphere is to research future medical devices that are easy to implement in both the physician’s office and the patient’s home, that are comfortable and small, and that can offer precise remote data and care,” said Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Founder and CEO of Biotricity. “We are extremely excited to receive ethics approval and look forward to building on the research of our flagship product, Bioflux, which is a highly accurate, clinical-grade remote patient monitoring device that specifically focuses on individuals diagnosed with or at risk for cardiovascular disease.” About Biotricity Inc.Biotricity is a modern medical technology company focused on delivering innovative, remote biometric monitoring solutions to the medical and consumer markets, including diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for chronic conditions and lifestyle improvement. Biotricity’s R&D continues to focus on the preventative healthcare market, with a vision of putting health management into the hands of the individual.

IMPROVING LIVES
through innovation in remote medical monitoring










The complete solution for real-time remote cardiac monitoring











The personal wearable heart monitor for self‑managed preventative care











IMPROVING LIVES
through innovation in remote medical monitoring










Real-time remote cardiac monitoring











The personal wearable heart monitor for self‑managed preventative care



Biotricity is at the leading edge of professional and personal remote medical monitoringChronic diseases are growing at an alarming rate as we continue to live longer. This creates an ever expanding burden on our healthcare system as costs continue to rise for ongoing and long-term treatment. One of the single most effective approaches to dealing with such costs is to improve patient engagement by enabling individuals to manage their condition. Unfortunately, there are few tools available that are clinically accurate and tailored to specific chronic conditions that individuals can utilize for disease management.
 

 
Biotricity is advancing the capabilities of remote biometric technology to improve the lives of people with chronic medical conditions. Our approach is to develop complementary technologies for diagnostic use by physicians and long-term use by individuals. Our goal is to further progress against a number of chronic diseases by developing solutions that are clinically accurate and tailor made for specific diseases.
 

 
Our first target is the world’s leading cause of death: cardiovascular disease. We’ve created real-time, high-precision remote monitoring technology used in medical research. Building upon our expertise, we’ve now developed Bioflux,1, 2 a remote cardiac monitoring system for use by physicians in testing and diagnosis. We’re also developing a personal monitoring device, Biolife, that will empower individuals to better manage their conditions and enhance the quality of lives.

Improving care, reducing costs
The challenge is immense, but so is the opportunity for transformative change that will improve patient outcomes and curb healthcare costs.
More than half of adults in the US suffer from at least one chronic disease, and almost one-third have multiple chronic conditions.3 Seven of the top ten causes of death in the US are chronic diseases,4 with cardiovascular disease alone responsible for 30.8% of all deaths.5
In most cases, these conditions are preventable through lifestyle changes. However, the hard reality, with which doctors contend every day, is that the effects of these conditions often manifest too gradually for people to recognize. It falls to the healthcare system to deal with these diseases after they’ve advanced to a serious stage, often at great financial cost. It was recently estimated that 86% of all healthcare spending in the US goes to the treatment of those with chronic diseases.3
US adults with at least one chronic diseaseNumber of chronic diseases in list of top 10 causes of deathHealthcare dollars spent on chronic diseasesIt is therefore vital to develop technology that enhances doctors’ ability to detect and diagnose these conditions—and to do so early enough for treatments to have their greatest effect. It is also crucial to follow that up with personal devices that provide feedback reinforcing patients’ adherence to doctors’ instructions after diagnosis.
Achieving these twin goals is Biotricity’s mission.
With the development of our Bioflux and Biolife systems, we’re tackling cardiovascular disease. We will move forward from there, applying our proven expertise in remote medical monitoring to the development of professional and personal systems that will aid in the fight against other chronic diseases as well.
