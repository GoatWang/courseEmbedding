David H. Laidley Elected to the EMCOR Group, Inc. Board of Directors | Business Wire


























































David H. Laidley Elected to the EMCOR Group, Inc. Board of Directors






December 16, 2008 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE: EME) today announced the election of David H. 
      Laidley to the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Laidley’s election to 
      the Board increases the number of EMCOR Directors to nine, bringing the 
      number of outside independent Directors to eight.
    

      Mr. Laidley, 61, was, for six years before his retirement in 2007, the 
      Chairman of Deloitte & Touche LLP (Canada), a professional services firm 
      providing audit, tax, financial and advisory and consulting services. 
      While serving as Chairman of Deloitte & Touche LLP (Canada), he was a 
      member of the Global Board of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, a member of its 
      Governance Committee and Chairman of its Audit & Finance Committee.
    

      In June 2007, Mr. Laidley was appointed a director of the Bank of Canada.
    

      Mr. Frank T. MacInnis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EMCOR 
      Group, Inc. commented, “We are pleased to welcome David Laidley to 
      EMCOR’s Board of Directors. David’s extensive and distinguished business 
      career will provide EMCOR’s Board and senior management with an 
      additional source of wise counsel as we operate and grow our business. 
      In particular, we hope to benefit from David’s experience as we develop 
      our North American business strategy that includes our Canadian 
      company’s promising positions in the nuclear power, oil sands, and heavy 
      industrial sectors. David is an ideal addition to our team, and I am 
      confident that EMCOR will benefit from his guidance.”
    

      Born and educated in Montreal, Canada, Mr. Laidley joined Deloitte & 
      Touche in 1967. He became a Chartered Accountant in 1970 and was 
      admitted as a partner to Deloitte & Touche LLP (Canada) in 1975. With a 
      broad background in the areas of tax and audit and assurance, Mr. 
      Laidley has extensive experience in the areas of corporate 
      reorganizations, acquisitions and divestures.
    

      Mr. Laidley has authored many articles dealing with corporate and 
      personal income tax matters. Additionally, he has lectured and made 
      regular guest appearances on radio to discuss economic and business 
      matters.
    

      Currently, Mr. Laidley also is a member of the Board of Directors of 
      Biovail Corp. and Aviva Canada, Inc., a Trustee of The Fraser Institute, 
      the John Dobson Foundation, and Pearson College of the Pacific, a member 
      of the Board of the Institute of Corporate Directors and past Chairman 
      of its Governance Committee, and Chairman of the Advisory Board, 
      Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University.
    

      EMCOR Group, Inc. is a Fortune 500® worldwide leader in mechanical and 
      electrical construction services, energy infrastructure and facilities 
      services. This press release and other press releases may be viewed at 
      the Company’s Web site at www.emcorgroup.com.
    

This release may contain certain forward-looking statements within 
      the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Any 
      such comments are based upon information available to EMCOR management 
      and its perception thereof, as of this date, and EMCOR assumes no 
      obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. These 
      forward-looking statements may include statements regarding market 
      opportunities, market share growth, gross profit, backlog mix, projects 
      with varying profit margins, and selling, general and administrative 
      expenses. These forward-looking statements involve risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      the forward-looking statements. Accordingly these statements are 
      no guarantee of future performance. Such risk and uncertainties 
      include, but are not limited to, adverse effects of general economic 
      conditions, changes in the political environment, changes in the 
      specific markets for EMCOR’s services, adverse business conditions, 
      availability of adequate levels of surety bonding, increased 
      competition, unfavorable labor productivity and mix of business. Certain 
      of the risks and factors associated with EMCOR’s business are also 
      discussed in the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K, its Form 10-Q for the third 
      quarter ended September 30, 2008, and in other reports filed from time 
      to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All these 
      risks and factors should be taken into account in evaluating any 
      forward-looking statements.
