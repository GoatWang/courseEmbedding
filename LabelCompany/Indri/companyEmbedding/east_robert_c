What do you believe and why do you believe it? There may be matters of your religion or spirituality which you haven't examined as yet - this book may be key in that examination.This unique 2-volume set of books is the account of a three and 1/2 year stay in the Himalayas by an 1800's English research expedition.During this time, they encountered true Masters of Eastern Wisdom and were allowed and encouraged to transcribe the teachings of these Masters and bring them back to the Western world.The author makes a bridge between East and West, between Buddhist and Christian - and enables us to share in his incredible exploits.And this report was published "...with the thought that the reader may accept or reject, as he wishes." So what you do with the information in this book is entirely up to you.Part of the Go Thunk Yourself Personal Development Library.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

DESCRIPTION
			An expert in moral and philosophical  psychology, Robert C. Roberts here  develops an original, up-to-date  understanding of human emotions in  relation to spirituality and as a basic  part of Christian moral character. With  an eye on pertinent Biblical texts,  Roberts explores emotions as nonsensory  perceptions that arise from personal  caring and concern. His study  culminates with an in-depth examination  of six "fruit of the Holy Spirit"  emotion-virtues: contrition, joy,  gratitude, hope, peace, and  compassion.Though Spiritual  Emotions is rigorous in its focus  on the inner structure of Christian  character, it is nonetheless readable  and is laced with many narrative  examples. The book will be immensely  useful for Christian ethicists,  psychologists, pastors, and  counselors.






REVIEWS

Gordon T. Smith— President, reSource Leadership International"Roberts has provided us with something urgently needed: critical thinking about the complex matter of the emotions. He brings together insights from philosophy, psychology, and literature that complement the needed theological analysis of the place of emotion in human — and thus Christian — experience. This work provides invaluable insight and guidance for church leaders, including preachers and those who direct worship, parents, educators, and all who are concerned with human formation."
