BRAZILIAN DISTRIBUTION CO COMPANHIA BRASILEIRA DE DISTR CBD - 20-F - 20060627 - COMPANY_INFORMATION





	ITEM 4.




	INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY





	4A.




	History and Development of the Company




	     We were incorporated in Brazil under the Brazilian corporate law on November 10, 1981 as Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição. Our principal executive offices are located at Avenida Brigadeiro Luis
	Antonio, no. 3,142, CEP 01402-901 São Paulo, SP, Brazil (telephone: 55-11-3886-0421). Our agent for service of process in the United States is CT Corporation, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York, 10019.


	     We have been a pioneer in the Brazilian retail food industry, opening our first store, a pastry shop, in 1948 in São Paulo City under the name

	Pão de Açúcar

	. We established one of the
	first supermarket chains in Brazil, opening our first supermarket in 1959, and opened the first hypermarket in Brazil in 1971.


	     Brazilian economic reforms implemented in 1994, including the introduction of the

	real

	as the Brazilian currency and the drastic reduction of inflation rates, resulted in an unprecedented growth in local consumer
	markets. It has been estimated that more than 19 million people gained access to consumer goods markets for the first time after 1994, as Brazilians, predominantly in lower and middle-income households, generally experienced real income gains. This
	increase in available income and the resulting increase in consumer confidence broadened our potential customer base and provided us with growth opportunities.


	     We responded to these changes by strengthening our capital structure, increasing our logistics and technology investments and implementing an expansion strategy focused on the different consumer preferences of the
	Brazilian population. To support our expansion strategy, consisting of acquisitions and organic growth, we defined the format of our stores in terms of the expectations, consumption patterns and purchasing power of the different income levels in
	Brazil.


	     From 2001 through 2005 we invested approximately R$415.2 million in technology, or about 11.4% of our total investments in the last five years. We also implemented projects designed to improve operational logistics and
	margins. In 1997, we began substituting our stores autonomous operating model for a more centralized system under which the responsibility for purchases was transferred to our commercial department. Our distribution and other administrative
	functions were also centralized to obtain economies of scale. These changes strengthened our negotiating position with suppliers with respect to prices and payment terms. In 2001, we finished implementing our new category management system, under
	which our commercial department became responsible solely for purchases in order to maximize bargaining power. However, we transferred category management decisions, which relate to the pricing and mix of products, to each of our banners, as they
	are in a better position to make these determinations for their particular target customers. We have also sought to gain efficiencies through improvements in our supply chain, in an effort to decrease stock-outs, breakage and shrinkage, and
	packaging and labor costs, as well as to increase inventory turnover.


	     Since 2001, we have acquired and merged a total of 172 stores. When entering new markets, we have generally sought to acquire local supermarket chains to benefit from existing know-how of the geographic region. For
	expansion within urban areas where we already have a presence, we have historically opened new stores. Nowadays our focus is to expand organically, not through acquisitions, as it was in the past.

	Table of Contents



	Although acquisition may occur, it is not the focus. Since 2001, we have also opened 68 new stores. Historically, our organic growth and smaller acquisitions have generally been funded from our cash flow from operations, and larger acquisition opportunities have required
	external funding or capital increases. We expect to fund future organic growth from our cash flow from operations. Our aggregate sales area has increased by 39.2% since 2001 as a result of our acquisitions and our opening of new stores.


	     Also in response to the increased levels of income resulting with the introduction of the

	real,

	we realized in 1998 that in order to take full advantage of Brazils economic growth, we needed to adjust the
	format of our stores according to the expectations and needs of different consumers. We refocused the

	Pão de Açúcar

	format to cater specifically to the high-income consumers and sought to target lower income consumers
	with a cost-oriented format,

	Barateiro,

	currently named

	CompreBem

	, which we acquired in 1998. The acquisition of the

	Barateiro

	chain represented a decisive step in carrying out our targeted marketing plans. Our diversity of
	formats allows us to reclassify stores to a more appropriate format within a market from time to time. Some

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores, particularly in the state of São Paulo, were converted into the

	Barateiro

	format in 2001, as average income levels dropped in neighborhoods of these stores original locations.


	     In June 2002, we acquired the

	Sé Supermercados

	chain of supermarkets, which, at the time of acquisition, was the seventh largest chain by sales in Brazil. All of the 60

	Sé

	stores were located
	in the state of São Paulo.


	     Also in 2002, as part of our effort to increase sales of our

	Barateiro

	stores, we launched a new store format known as

	CompreBem Barateiro

	in certain regions of Brazil. This format, which responded to
	market research from the target

	Barateiro

	audience, focused not only on reduced costs, but also on personal service, organization and increased customer relations. Under the new model, the stores offer new layouts, more modern equipment and a
	more pleasant shopping environment with a variety of services. In addition, the

	CompreBem Barateiro

	format emphasized the importance of family and community connection, sponsoring community outreach activities such as local artwork
	competitions and showcase of neighborhood childrens artwork in the stores. Due to the great consumer acceptance of this new format, which was evidenced by the performance as measured by total sales of

	CompreBem Barateiro

	stores as
	compared to

	Barateiro

	ones, we have converted the

	Barateiro

	stores into

	CompreBem

	stores.


	     During 2005, CBD undertook an intense review of its purchasing and category management activities including processes, systems and management models. Additionally, throughout the year the strategies for all categories
	of the Companys sales mix were redefined. All these initiatives aimed at increasing efficiency in negotiations with suppliers, product assortment, exposure in the stores, promotions and pricing. In 2006 we will execute the actions and
	strategies defined in 2005, by which the Company expects to reach higher competitiveness and profitability levels.



	     The Sendas Strategic Partnership



	     In December 2003, we signed a letter of intent to enter into an association with Sendas S.A., or Sendas. The association was named Sendas Distribuidora S.A., or Sendas Distribuidora, and became operational in February
	2004. At that time, Sendas Distribuidoras voting stock was held 50% by us and 50% by Sendas, and we are responsible for the management of the company. See Item 10.C  Material Contracts  The Sendas Association. Sendas
	has been operating in the Brazilian retail market for 43 years, operating exclusively in the state of Rio de Janeiro. As of December 2005, Sendas network was comprised of 18 hypermarkets and 89 supermarkets. The association with Sendas was an
	important strategic step towards growth and leadership consolidation in the Brazilian market. Sendas Distribuidora is enjoying the benefits from the synergy with our corporate operations. Furthermore, this association is helping us to increase our
	presence in other businesses including gas stations (Sendas Distribuidora had 8 in December 2005 compared to 8 in February 2004) and drugstores (Sendas Distribuidora already had 47 in December 2005 compared to 32 in February 2004).



	     The AIG Group association



	     In order to reduce net indebtedness and strengthen the capital structure of Sendas Distribuidora, on November 30, 2004, Sendas, CBD and investment funds of the AIG Group - AIG entered into an agreement through which AIG
	invested R$135.7 million (equivalent to U.S.$ 50 million) in Sendas Distribuidora, through the acquisition of 157,082,802 Class B preferred shares and 2,000 Class A common shares, issued by Sendas


	13









	Table of Contents



	Distribuidora, representing 14.86% of its capital. Due to the agreement, CBD currently has a 42.57% stake in Sendas.


	     Pursuant to the agreement, CBD and AIG mutually granted reciprocal call and sale options for shares acquired by AIG from Sendas Distribuidora, which may be exercised within 4 years. Upon the exercise of these options, the
	shares of Sendas Distribuidora purchased by AIG would represent a credit, valued pursuant to a formula based on multiples of EBITDA of Sendas Distribuidora less its net debt, held by AIG against CBD, which would be used to subscribe up to three
	billion preferred shares issued by CBD that will be created in a future capital increase. Any excess of the credit above the three billion shares issued by CBD would be paid in cash. The price of the future issuance of preferred shares issued by CBD
	will be set based on market value at the time of issuance. The capital increase will also allow CBD shareholders to exercise preemptive rights with respect to preferred shares.



	     The Itaú CBD association



	     On October 27, 2004, we entered into a partnership agreement with Banco Itaú Holding Financeira, or Itaú Holding, to establish a new financial institution named Financeira Itaú CBD S.A. Crédito, Financiamento e
	Investimento (FIC). FIC service kiosks in our stores have exclusive rights to offer private label and co-branded credit cards, personal and consumer credit, extended warranties and insurance. Currently, FIC kiosks are present in 322 of
	our stores. We and Itaú Holding each indirectly hold 50% of FICs capital stock. However, Itaú Holding is responsible for the management of the company, being entitled to appoint most of the companys officers.


	     In 2005, FIC  Financeira Itaú CBD, advanced on three fronts, recording physical and financial growth and increasing its share of sales. During the year, 308 FIC stands were installed in

	Extra

	(79),

	Extra-Eletro

	(49),

	CompreBem

	(90),

	Sendas

	(32) and

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores (58), almost 100% more than the initial annual target of 156. The number of clients exceeded the four-million mark in December
	2005, also higher than the initial target. In fact, FIC gave priority to growing the client base in order to build a representative portfolio to work with in the coming years.


	     In addition, more than three million private-label cards (exclusively for use in CBD stores) were issued during the year, overtaking the number of existing cards issued by CBDs previous financial partners. This
	increase in clients also allowed FIC to beat the target for share of sales.


	     Receivables, representing the volume of consumer financing, were also above-target in all of the established indicators, underlining the success of the annual strategy, based on growth and increased participation. As a
	result of this approach, FIC posted a net loss in 2005, although this should be reversed in 2007, which we expect will be the operations break-even year.





	     Co-Control by the Diniz Family and Casino



	     On May 3, 2005, the Diniz group (consisting of our shareholders Mr. Abilio Diniz, Península Participações Ltda., or Península, and the other members of the Diniz family that control Península) and the Casino group
	executed a Joint Venture Agreement, which set forth a series of transactions that resulted in equal co-control by the Casino group, on the one hand, and the Diniz group, on the other, through the Holding Company that controls CBD. On June 22, 2005,
	a Holding Company Shareholders Agreement and a new CBD Shareholders Agreement were entered into, superseding the 1999 shareholders agreement between the groups. See Item 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions
	 Major Shareholders  Shareholders Transactions. Financial settlement of the transaction occurred on July 8, 2005.


	     The Casino group and the Diniz group contributed 2.2 billion and 30.5 billion CBD common shares, respectively, to the Holding Company allowing the Holding Company to become our controlling shareholder by the ownership of 65.6% of the voting shares
	of CBD, which represents 28.8% of our share capital. Both Diniz group and Casino group owns 50% of the common shares of the Holding Company.


	     On June 14, 2005, CVM sent us a letter in which it requested the acquirer of our shares under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement to make a mandatory tender offer to the minority holders of our common shares, based on CVMs understanding
	that implementation of the transaction detailed in the Joint Venture Agreement would represent a transfer of our corporate control. On June 28, 2005, we filed a petition before CVM (i) requesting that its respective technical areas
	(

	Superintendências de Registro de Valores Mobiliários e de Relações com Empresas

	)


	14









	Table of Contents



	reconsider their decision dated as of June 14, 2005; or, (ii) in case of rejection of our request, submitting an appeal from such decision before the CVMs Board (

	Colegiado

	), in accordance with the terms of applicable regulation. Our
	petition was not reconsidered by CVM technical areas and in a meeting held in April 11, 2006 the CVM Committee (

	Colegiado

	) did not accept the appeal, instead ratifying the assessment of the technical areas of CVM and calling for the exercise
	of the public tender offer to acquire voting shares in the market corresponding to approximately 0.06% of our voting capital. Despite the request for registering a public offering for the acquisition of our outstanding voting shares made by Casino
	on May 16, 2006 before the CVM, we expressly reiterated our understanding that the corporate transaction between Diniz group and Casino group did not constitute a transfer of our control.



	Co-Control



	     Control of CBD is in the form of equal representation of the two shareholding groups on the boards of the Holding Company and of CBD. Abilio Diniz will act as Chairman of the Holding Company for at least the first seven years of the joint venture.
	All corporate actions of the Holding Company require unanimity, except that certain issues, including those pertaining to the Chairmanship, quorum, and dividend policy, are governed by the Holding Company Shareholders Agreement.


	     The CBD board of directors is now composed of five Casino group representatives, five Diniz group representatives and four independent directors, jointly appointed by the Casino group and the Diniz group. Abilio Diniz will continue to act as
	Chairman of the board of directors of CBD and for at least the first seven years of the joint venture will be appointed by Diniz group. Starting June 22, 2012, the appointment of the Chairman will alternate every three fiscal years and Casino group
	will have the right to the first alternate appointment. A unanimous vote of a quorum of the board of directors, not including the independent directors, is required in matters involving a conflict of interest with Abilio Diniz. Specified matters,
	including those with respect to quorum, certain investments, and certain issuances of debt, are governed by the Holding Company Shareholders Agreement. Our Chief Executive Officer will be jointly selected by the Diniz group and the Casino
	group out of a list of three candidates submitted to our board of directors by Abilio Diniz.


	     The Diniz group has agreed to lock up its stake in the Holding Company for the first nine years following the closing of the transaction. Similarly, the Casino group has agreed to a lock up of its stake for 18 months following the closing of the
	transaction. At the end of these lock-up periods, the other Holding Company shareholder will generally have a right of first refusal to buy the stake, if it is offered for sale.


	     The Holding Company Shareholders Agreement provides that beginning in 2012, Casino may appoint the Chairman of the board of the Holding Company who could be someone other than Abilio Diniz or his designee. In the case of Casinos
	exercise of its right to appoint a Chairman, the shareholder agreement provides for put and call mechanisms that, if used, would change the voting control of the Holding Company. In particular, Casinos exercise of its right to appoint a
	Chairman would result in reduced corporate governance rights for Abilio Diniz and the Diniz group. In addition, the Diniz group may cause the Casino group to purchase a direct equity interest in the Holding Company representing 500,000,000 shares of
	CBD, and thereafter during a period of eight years to cause the Casino group to purchase the remaining block of shares owned by the Diniz group. If these put rights are not exercised by the Diniz group, Casino has a share call that would be
	sufficient to transfer share voting control. See Item 7  Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions  Major Shareholders  Shareholders Transactions.



	Associated real estate transactions



	     The real estate and buildings holding 60 stores and associated commercial malls (28

	approximately 30.5% of our total sales) were transferred to a real estate investment fund called Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Península, whose quotas are owned by a company controlled by the Diniz group (hereinafter referred as
	Reco Master).


	     On October 3, 2005 and December 30, 2005, final agreements were entered into referring to the sale of the referred real estate properties to Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Península. The properties were
	transferred at their fair value. Indeed, an appraisal by independent experts with international reputation confirmed that the net book value of these properties, in the amount of R$1,029 million, is equivalent to their fair market value. CBD and

	Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Península entered into long-term lease agreements in accordance with Brazilian market terms. In particular, rents amount to 2% of gross sales, and the term of the lease agreements will remain in effect
	for a period of 20 years, with two subsequent 10-year renewals at the option of CBD. CBD has also the right to exit individual stores before the termination of each lease term. The total amount paid under these leases in 2005 was R$ 29.0 million
	(out of which R$28.3 million were paid directly by CBD). CBD paid to the Diniz Group R$ 25.5 million, on the inception date of the lease agreements, as an initial fee for entering into those long-term lease agreements.


	     CBD, the Diniz group, and the Casino group executed an agreement that establishes the principles governing the relationship between CBD, Reco Master and Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Península. Pursuant to the agreement, as
	amended, CBD and Casino group each own a golden share issued by Reco Master, providing them with specific rights that ensure the proper use of the real estate properties by the Diniz group.


	     The ultimate use of the proceeds from the transfer of real estate store assets will be to reduce CBDs debt and will also enhance its ability to fund its growth.



	Tax impacts of the transactions



	     Following completion of the transaction, the parties have agreed that Casino will contribute to CBD the acquisition goodwill generated by the Casino group as a result of its acquisitions of CBD shares, as contemplated by CVM regulation. In return,
	the Casino group will be entitled to receive the economic benefits of new CBD preferred shares without additional payment, to the extent that the goodwill is utilized to generate tax credits for CBD.



	Casinos call option for 2.5% of share capital



	     Abilio Diniz and a relative have granted the Casino group a call option for a period of three years on 2.8 billion of CBD common shares at an exercise price of U.S.$ 28 per thousand common shares. The exercise of this option by the Casino group
	would not affect Casinos equal control with the Diniz group of the Holding Company. See Item 7  Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions  Major Shareholders.

	Business Overview




	The Brazilian Retail Food Sector



	     The Brazilian retail food sector represented approximately 5.5% of Brazils GDP in 2005. According to ABRAS (Brazils supermarket association), the food retail sector in Brazil had gross revenues of R$ 106
	billion in 2005, a 7.8% increase over 2004. The Brazilian retail food sector is highly fragmented. However, despite the consolidation within the Brazilian retail food industry, the five largest supermarket chains have accounted for an estimated
	40.5% of the retail food sector in 2005, down from 41.2% in 2001. We believe this consolidation will continue, and this is expected to favor large food retailers, such as us, that can take advantage of better economies of scale in the provision of
	services, implementation of cost-cutting and efficiency measures, and sourcing from suppliers. According to ABRAS, our gross sales represented 15.2% of the gross sales of the entire retail food sector in 2005.


	     Foreign ownership in the Brazilian food retail sector began with

	Carrefour

	, a leading French retail chain, which opened its first hypermarket 31 years ago. In the last decade, international chains such as

	Wal-Mart

	and

	Sonae

	have also entered the Brazilian market, mostly through acquisitions of domestic retail food chains, and competition in the industry has intensified. In addition to the organized retail food sector, the Brazilian
	retail food sector also consists of small food retailers which frequently avail themselves of access to merchandise from irregular and informal distribution channels. This merchandise usually has lower prices than those charged by manufacturers and
	stores in the conventional supply chain of the organized retail food sector.


	     Overall supermarket penetration in Brazil today, in terms of the number of supermarkets relative to overall population and area, is estimated to be below the levels common in the United States, many western European
	countries such as France and some South American countries such as Chile. Management believes that the population of Brazil is an important factor affecting the potential growth in supermarket activity. According to the Brazilian Institute of
	Geography and Statistics, or IBGE, the total population of Brazil was approximately 184.2


	16









	Table of Contents



	million at the end of 2005, making Brazil the fifth most populous country in the world, and the population is currently growing at a rate of 1.4% per year. As approximately 83% of the population lives in urban areas, and the urban population has
	been increasing at a greater rate than the population as a whole, our business is particularly well positioned to benefit from economies of scale deriving from Brazils urban growth. São Paulo, with a population of approximately 10.9
	million, and Rio de Janeiro, with a population of approximately 6.1 million, are the two largest cities in Brazil. São Paulo State has a total population in excess of 40.4 million, representing approximately 21.9% of the Brazilian
	population. São Paulo State is the first and Rio de Janeiro is the second largest consumer market in which we operate.


	     The Brazilian retail sector is perceived as essentially growth-oriented, since retail margins are substantially more constrained compared to other business sectors. We are therefore intrinsically dependent on the growth
	rate of Brazils urban population and its different income levels. While living expenses in Brazil are lower than those in North America, Western Europe and Japan, Brazilian household income levels are also substantially lower.


	     The following table sets forth the different income class levels of Brazilian households, according to Ibope.

	C 


	 


	Between R$11,124 and R$20,028 




	D 


	 


	Between R$5,088 and R$11,124 






	     Class A households account for only 6% of the urban population, and class B households account for 23% of the urban population. Classes C, D and E collectively represent 71% of all urban households. In recent years, the
	class C, D and E households have been increasing, and now have greater purchasing power.


	     Current salary levels in Brazil have generally lagged compared to increases in interest and exchange rates and price levels. We expect that increased consumption by the lower income class levels will take place over
	time as a result of gradual increments to salary levels and a steadily growing population. As seen in the years immediately following the introduction of the

	real

	, even small increments in purchasing power generally result in significant
	increases in consumption in absolute terms, as well as increased expenditures in premium priced food products and other non-food items, including home appliances and consumer electronics.



	Our Company



	     We are the largest food retailer in Brazil based on both gross revenues and number of stores. In 2005, we had a market share of approximately 15.2% in the Brazilian food retailing business according to ABRAS, with
	annualized gross sales of R$16.1 billion. As of December 31, 2005, we operated 556 stores throughout Brazil, of which 506 were retail food stores. Of our retail food stores, 316 are located in São Paulo State, representing 58.2% of our net
	sales revenue from our retail food stores in 2005. São Paulo State is Brazils largest consumer market. We are among the market leaders in the retail food stores in the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília,
	Curitiba, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and Fortaleza. The Companys sales are effected through different sales formats under five banners:

	Pão de Açúcar

	(185 supermarkets),

	CompreBem

	(176 supermarkets),

	Sendas

	(66 supermarkets),

	Extra

	(79 hypermarkets) and

	Extra


	Eletro

	(50 home appliance stores).

	Our Competitive Strengths



	     Our main competitive strengths are our different retail food store formats, our extensive network of distribution centers, our economies of scale, our prime locations in densely populated urban areas and growing
	provincial urban areas, and our high level of customer service.


	18









	Table of Contents




	     Different retail food store formats



	     We conduct our retail food operations under three main store formats,

	Pão de Açúcar

	,

	CompreBem/Sendas

	and

	Extra

	, each of which has a distinct merchandising strategy and a strong
	brand name. We offer a variety of formats, which enables us to effectively target different consumer preferences and thus earn their loyalty. This approach, coupled with our intimate understanding of the Brazilian consumer permits us to meet diverse
	customer needs without confusing consumers as to the marketing or price focus of each format. Each of our brand concepts is clearly identified in the marketplace for a combination of goods and services offered and relative consumer wealth. For
	example, our

	Pão de Açúcar

	format is positioned to serve the higher income consumers through a combination of store location, store design and product and service offerings. Our second format, under the

	CompreBem

	and

	Sendas

	banners, is targeted to middle and lower income consumer brackets. Our third retail format,

	Extra

	, is our hypermarket format which offers the widest assortment of any of our store formats and allows us to target potential
	customers along the entire income spectrum. Our hypermarket stores have the additional advantage of benefiting from the general lack of department stores and specialized stores in Brazil. As a result, a retailer such as an

	Extra

	store that
	also sells non-food products such as household appliances, consumer electronic products, general merchandise, clothing and textiles is particularly convenient to a Brazilian consumer.



	     Extensive network of distribution centers



	     We operate distribution centers strategically located within the cities of São Paulo, Brasília, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro and Recife. Our distribution centers have a total storage capacity of
	380,000 square meters of built-in area. Our management believes that our network of distribution centers is the most extensive and technologically advanced product distribution center network in the Brazilian retail food industry. We believe that
	our facilities are capable of servicing substantially all of our distribution requirements, both for our existing stores and for the stores that we currently plan to open in the near future. Approximately 83% of our inventory in 2005 came directly
	from a distribution center instead of a supplier, a substantial increase from 72% in 2001, resulting in higher bargain power with suppliers, fewer inventory shortages, lower shrinkage and improved working capital management. Many of the functions
	of our distribution centers are automated, allowing for quicker and more efficient handling of products. Our distribution centers are supported by sophisticated systems which other Brazilian retailers lack, including

	pd@net

	, a
	business-to-business technology platform which links our computer automated ordering system, our suppliers and our distribution centers to automatically replenish our inventory.



	     Economies of scale



	     We enjoy significant economies of scale resulting from our position as the largest food retailer in Brazil. Our large scale gives us increased bargaining power with suppliers, resulting in lower prices for consumers,
	higher operating margins and more favorable payment terms. Our size permits us to benefit from important marketing channels including prime time television advertising, one of the most effective means to promote sales, which would be prohibitively
	expensive for smaller retail chains. Our scale also enables us to make major operational investments, such as in technology, which generates attractive returns. Our size and financial strength, compared to most other supermarket chains in Brazil,
	has put us at the forefront of the Brazilian retail industry in using information technology and in continually improving our sophisticated management information systems.



	     Prime locations in densely populated urban areas and growing provincial urban centers



	     Since we started our operations in 1959, we have been able to accumulate store locations for our

	Pão de Açúcar

	and

	Extra

	stores in prime sites that offer significant competitive
	advantages. Our older stores in São Paulo and Brasília are located in high traffic residential neighborhoods and, as a result, the average monthly sales per square meter in these stores is substantially higher than that of the average
	supermarket in Brazil. Since prime real estate in these urban areas in Brazil is scarce, new stores would be prohibitively expensive for competitors. Our recent association with

	Sendas

	in the state of Rio de Janeiro enabled us to add numerous
	high quality locations.



	     High level of customer service



	     All of our store formats offer a broad selection of quality products in a pleasant shopping environment that emphasizes customer service. We believe that our emphasis on employee training and our commitment to employee
	loyalty lead to higher levels of customer service which differentiates us from our competitors. We have also developed customer loyalty and recognition programs which we believe enhance our competitive position. For our


	19









	Table of Contents




	Pão de Açúcar

	,

	CompreBem-Sendas

	and

	Extra

	formats, we offer a preferred shopping card, which customers present at checkout and which collects information on the shopping patterns of our customers and offers
	credit products. Based on this information, we also offer personalized discounts to our customers. We were also the first Brazilian food retailer to appoint a customer liaison to voice opinions, suggestions and complaints on behalf of customers. We
	have won several awards from industry associates for our innovative service such as

	Prêmio SM Excelência no Varejo

	(the excellence in retail award) given by a group of industry professionals.



	     Offering of additional products and services



	     In the past several years, we have begun to expand our range of complementary products and services in an effort to enhance our customer satisfaction and provide additional revenue sources. For example, with respect to
	the

	Extra

	hypermarket format, we have begun to provide additional services tailored to the specific needs of

	Extra

	s broad base of customers, such as gasoline stations within the parking area of

	Extra

	stores. In addition,
	we have successfully test marketed and are currently incorporating drugstores into our existing store formats. Our recent association with

	Sendas

	has greatly expanded our presence in drugstore services.


	     During 2005, our partnership with Itaú Holding, to exploit financial products and services at CBDs stores, was enhanced. The main product is private label cards that attracted more than 3.2 million card
	holders by the end of the year. FIC partnership allows CBD, to offer its customers a wider variety of credit products and facilities.


	     The main benefits offered by FIC are: lower risk and cheaper funding, due to the presence of a strong financial partner; increase in investments and technological updating, as Itaús core business includes
	the investment in this type of activity; better quality products and higher profitability for the Company; wider products and services portfolio, such as personal credit, insurance, etc; and reduction of operating expenses.



	Our Strategy



	Our strategy is focused on pursuing increased efficiency, allowing us to operate with lower costs and expenses and greater competitiveness. The resulting gains will allow us to become even more competitive, thereby boosting our main performance
	indicator  growth of same-store sales  in turn generating greater assets turnover and higher returns. In 2005, our focus was to identify opportunities for improving efficiency, whereas in 2006 the goal is to consolidate these
	initiatives, thereby ensuring a virtuous circle of increased profitability and competitiveness. We therefore drew up and implemented several initiatives throughout the year that will allow us to achieve the main goal of trimming costs and expenses
	and becoming more efficient.



	Commercial Dynamic Project



	     Resulting from the new management model, which brought together the purchasing and category-management areas, the Commercial Dynamic project is a key ingredient of our strategy. By revising the management model,
	processes and systems related to these two areas, it will ensure greater efficiency in such aspects as negotiations with suppliers, defining the best product assortment, pricing strategies, promotions and product display.



	Zero Base Budget



	     The adoption of this methodology is designed to ensure that our budgets are determined in a more rational manner, taking into account real needs and/or what really adds value to the operation. The next step was to
	construct a ranking of proposed expenditures in order to prioritize those most relevant to achieving our strategic goals. In order to ensure that expenditures are monitored in the most efficient manner, we also adopted, in line with Zero Base
	Budget, a model whereby executives variable compensation will be tied to meeting the expenditure targets.



	Shared Services Center



	     In order to eliminate the overlapping of internal tasks and procedures that have arisen from the growth of our administrative area in recent years, we created an area which will concentrate all our repetitive and
	bureaucratic operational services, i.e. those that do not involve such aspects as strategy, decision taking or creation. In practice, they can be reduced to certain activities in the accounting, human resources, property management and treasury
	areas, among others. Initially, the center will map out the various departments demands and needs in relation to


	20









	Table of Contents



	these activities in order to identify how the associated processes take place. Centralization will allow them to be carried out in a more rational manner, in line with real demand. Subsequently, we intend to identify opportunities for boosting
	productivity and reducing expenses.



	New purchasing area for non-saleable products and services



	     This new area was set up to unify the acquisition of products and services not destined for resale, which had previously been handled by various corporate areas. These purchases, involving items that are essential for
	the day-to-day functioning of our offices and stores, such as cleaning materials, paper, outsourced services, electric power, water, airfares, etc., amount to around R$ 2 billion per year. The aim is to provide the area with the same expertise we
	use when acquiring the products sold in our stores. This means making maximum use of its bargaining power, which will translate into more fruitful supplier negotiations backed by the most up-to-date negotiating techniques.



	Cancellation of marketing contracts



	     CBD cancelled all its contracts with outside marketing agencies and concentrated all publicity activities for its store banners in the hands of PA Publicidade, an agency belonging to the Group.


	     All the above mentioned initiatives already implemented in the Company aim at increasing efficiency by reducing costs and expenses. Our main objective is to be more price-competitive and boost same-store sales.


	     Additionally, CBD is investing in competitive advantages, such as:



	To strengthen brand-positioning advantages, with each store banner developing marketing and consumer- relations activities for their respective target publics;




	To restructure e-commerce operations, with an emphasis on non-food items, thereby strengthening

	Extra

	s share of this important sales channel;




	To reinforce non-food operations in general, with an emphasis on home electronics and appliances, textiles and household/auto/gardening items, consolidating the

	Extra

	brand as a national reference and increasing in-and-out initiatives;




	To increase private-label sales in all store banners, thereby boosting sales margins;




	To increase the share of gas stations and drugstores in all store banners by opening new stores, helping cement customer loyalty and increasing store traffic;




	To strengthen the activities of Financeira Itaú CBD (FIC) by developing products and services that represent new forms of revenue generation and act as important mechanisms for building loyalty and increasing store traffic.




	     Further improve efficiencies



	     We continually seek to improve operating efficiencies in connection with our supply chain. We were one of the first supermarket chains in Brazil to equip our stores with a point of sale, or POS, system and utilize a
	computer automated ordering system that automatically replenishes our inventory. We intend to improve operating efficiencies in other stages of the supply chain, particularly product outflow, by increasing the volume of merchandise going through our
	distribution centers. In 2005, approximately 83% of our inventory came directly from one of our distribution centers instead of a supplier. In the past year, we combined our perishable and groceries departments in an effort to rationalize and
	reduce costs and we consolidated our non-food product area and our flower department in order to achieve operating efficiency. Also, as part of our strategy, we intend to substantially increase our cross-docking capability, which should result in
	working capital savings and lower inventory levels. We also intend to improve handling to further decrease stock-outs, breakage and shrinkage and delivery costs. For example, we are exerting pressure on suppliers to ship their products in amounts
	that are less than a full pallet which we feel will result in cost savings through lower levels of spoilage.





	     Private Label strategy



	     Private-label and first-price products constitute one of the main components of our strategy for the next


	21









	Table of Contents



	four years. Our aim is to double sales of private-label and best-price products, which will not only give us an extra edge over our competitors, but should also strengthen customer loyalty.


	     In the fourth quarter of 2005, therefore, we developed a new private-label brand for all our stores  the

	Escolha Econômica

	(literally Economical Choice) line. As its name implies, it aims
	to offer products at the lowest price in the market. Our intention is to boost competitiveness by forming a strong association between the our stores and low prices; to generate store traffic by attracting price-conscious consumers; to expand the
	range of low-priced products; to increase our bargaining power within our industry; to maintain consumption patterns among customers whose purchasing power has diminished; and to promote experimentation among customers with more rigid consumption
	patterns that habitually consume certain products. The idea is to offer the products with the highest sales volume in each of 400 categories of items.


	     In 2005, we launched 60

	Escolha Econômica

	items, as well as 318 other private-label ones:

	Pão de Açúcar

	(86), Good Light (10), Mister Valley (14),

	CompreBem

	(40), Sendas
	(113) and Extra (55). Both private-label and best-price items recorded substantially higher gross profits than in 2004. Over the period from 2001-2005, sales have increased at an average annual rate of 70%.


	      Seasonal performance was also strong. At Easter time, private-label Easter egg sales moved up 48% compared to sales a year earlier. They were accompanied a series of free gifts, such as characters from Sítio do Pica Pau Amarelo (a famous series of Brazilian childrens books), Robots and Disney Pixar characters. At Christmas time, we launched seven seasonal items, including meat products (

	Tender

	 ham;

	Pernil

	 leg of pork; and

	Ave Natalina

	- chicken), and new varieties of

	panettone

	(honey bread for Extra and

	Pão de Açúcar

	and the introduction of the previous years favorite  cream fudge  into the

	CompreBem

	and Sendas stores). Period sales volume jumped 56% over 2004.


	     Another of the years highlights was the construction of the Innovation Center, which will substantially step up the development of private-label items. It comprises two areas: the consumer research center, where
	products are tested with consumers against leading brands to ensure that they can compete in quality with the best in the market; and the culinary center, responsible for devising the new products in association with the suppliers and for creating
	the recipes that will eventually appear on the packaging. In less than a year of operations, 138 consumer tests and 176 technical tests were carried out and 82 courses were offered

	     Pão de Açúcar Stores



	     

	Pão de Açúcar

	operates convenient neighborhood stores. Our

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores are predominantly located in large urban areas (with over one-third located in the
	greater São Paulo City area). We believe this to be a significant competitive advantage since available sites in those urban areas are scarce. The

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores target the Brazilian class A and class B
	household consumers, whose minimum annual household income exceeds R$20,028. The stores are characterized by a pleasant shopping environment, a broad mix of quality products, innovative service offerings and a high level of personal service, with
	an average of 59 employees per 1000 square meters of store space. Many of these stores feature specialty areas such as perishables, baked goods, wine, ready-to-eat dishes, meat, cheese and seafood departments. Many stores offer shopping advisors to
	assist customers with inquiries about particular food needs, prices, special discounts and brand information.

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores also offer private label products, including the

	Goodlight

	brand of health food
	products.




	     We had 185

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores at December 31, 2005. The

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores range in size from 331 to 4,730 square meters and averaged 1,336 square meters of
	selling space at December 31, 2005. The sale of food products represented 93.3% and non-food products represented 6.7% of

	Pão de Açúcar

	net sales revenue in 2005.

	Pão de Açúcar

	customers can
	also make purchases on-line through

	paodeacucar.com.br

	, the

	Pão de Açúcar

	website. This site is available to customers in the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília and Curitiba.


	     

	Pão de Açúcar

	recorded gross sales of R$ 3.9 billion in 2005, versus R$ 4.0 billion in 2004. The decline was primarily due to the conversion of 12 stores to the

	CompreBem

	format and by
	a slowdown in consumption and food deflation.


	     Nevertheless,

	Pão de Açúcar

	maintained its 2004 market share. This was mainly thanks to the good performance of the stores in the more cosmopolitan regions, whose sales increased. Such
	stores are responsible for 75% of total sales.


	     The remaining 25%, located in regions where there is strong price competition, were more affected by the market variations, albeit not unduly.


	     In order to counter the declining price of certain food products, there was a more pronounced specialization in certain items regarded as strategic, such as coffee, wine, olive oil, and bread. A variety of initiatives
	were implemented to reinforce

	Pão de Açúcar

	s presence in these categories and encourage their purchase, thereby adding value, increasing consumers understanding of the product and generating a healthier
	cost/benefit ratio.


	     These initiatives were not limited to enhancing product variety, but also involved services that supplied consumers with additional information through specialist talks, posters, leaflets and blackboard notices,
	equipping them to make more knowledgeable purchase decisions. One such example was a pilot project involving wine, whereby customers could make use of touch-screen terminals to seek information on the product in question. We intend to extend this
	procedure to other products.


	     In order to improve productivity, we established a project to permit continuous store monitoring. We created a series of tools allowing managers to undertake a more detailed analysis of sales behavior and,
	subsequently, introduce staffing levels more appropriate to day-to-day store movement. The pursuit of best practices continued throughout the year and

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores across the board were subjected to internal
	expense-reduction benchmarks in order to boost productivity.


	     Following a study carried out during the year, the

	Pão de Açúcar


	Mais

	program, a preferred shopper/fidelity card, will be overhauled and relaunched in six stores in 2006. The new
	program will hopefully be self-sustaining and will attract consumers.



	     CompreBem/Sendas Stores



	     

	CompreBem

	supermarkets offer competitive prices and essential services.

	CompreBem

	stores target the Brazilian class C and class D household consumers, whose annual household income is less than R$20,000
	and which collectively make up approximately 85% of all urban households. Accordingly,

	CompreBem

	stores are located in lower-income neighborhoods compared to

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores. Generally,

	CompreBem

	stores offer more competitively priced products than

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores. In addition, these stores are characterized by a lower level of personal service than

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores, with an
	average of 40 employees per 1000 square meters of store space.


	23









	Table of Contents



	     We have a private label preferred shopper/fidelity card, the

	Clube CompreBem

	card, which is currently used by approximately 700,000 customers. This card, in addition to assisting us in the collection of consumer
	shopping data, allows us to offer customers credit products.


	     We had 176 stores under the

	CompreBem

	banner at December 31, 2005.

	CompreBems

	stores range in size from 300 to 5,092 square meters and averaged 1,219 square meters of selling space at December 31,
	2005. In 2005, non-food items accounted for approximately 8.1% and food items accounted for approximately 91.9% of

	CompreBem

	net sales revenue.


	     The

	Sendas

	communications strategy is aligned to the

	CompreBem

	format. However, emphasis will be placed on the regional characteristics of the Rio de Janeiro market, such as a strong presence on
	television. Another goal will be the revitalization of the banners image as a prestigious brand that celebrated its 45th anniversary in second quarter of 2005.


	     

	Sendas

	ended 2005 with 66 stores and gross sales of R$1.4 billion. Its focus was on the profitability of the business and its brand repositioning in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the resulting revitalization
	of the banners image among consumers.


	     The changes followed the same pattern adopted by the

	CompreBem

	chain and were aimed at making

	Sendas

	the main supermarket option for middle class women in Rio de Janeiro.


	     

	CompreBem

	and

	Sendas

	had an exceptionally good year in 2005, particularly

	Sendas

	, with sales up 20% as compared to 2004.

	CompreBem

	also did well, recording gross sales of R$ 2.6 billion, up
	7.7% .


	     One of the main factors behind these results was the conversion of 60

	Sendas

	stores in Rio de Janeiro, incorporating the new positioning focused on the lower end of the middle-income spectrum, developed in 2004
	for the

	CompreBem

	stores. The project, undertaken between February and June, consumed around R$ 100 million in remodeling and recuperation of the banners image. This enhanced alignment of

	Sendas

	stores with the

	CompreBem

	model also helped recoup

	Sendas

	 image in Rio and it increased its market share (according to Nielsen, which tracks retail performance). The investment was quickly rewarded in terms of performance, with growth accelerating as of June.

	Sendas

	closed the year with CBDs best results.


	     Despite these advances, there are still many challenges ahead due to the nature of the Rio market, which is more competitive than other regions and demands higher expenditure. One initiative that will certainly help
	reduce expenses is the new commercial framework, under which a good deal of the business management was transferred to São Paulo, with only operations, regional supplier development and marketing remaining in Rio

	.

	Another
	positive step was the conversion of five ABC stores in Rio to the

	Sendas

	format.


	     In 2005,

	CompreBem

	replaced 12

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores, which were out of alignment with the latters positioning, mostly
	located in São Paulo state (outside the capital), and six Coopercitrus ones, acquired by CBD in May 2005. In the case of these six, a new store model was created, called

	City Supermarket

	, which functions as a small hypermarket in
	towns, which do not have this type of establishment. One example is the store in Barretos, which has 3,500 square meters of floor space and differs from its competitors in its greater attention to non-food lines, including an extensive home
	electronics and appliance range, a bigger household/auto/gardening area and a streamlined textile section. The aim of the format is to complement existing food sales, thereby attracting more customers.


	     In conjunction with FIC, there were a number of initiatives geared towards pleasing customers with

	CompreBem

	and

	Sendas

	cards, but the undoubted highlight was the in-and-out initiatives, dubbed now
	or never in both stores, designed to reinforce the low-price image and increase traffic of consumers. In order to supply consumers with the products in question  with a focus on non-food items that are not part of the stores
	normal mix  whose total or installment price is low, the association with FIC was crucial in ensuring low installment payments



	     Extra /Extra Eletro Stores



	     

	Extra

	hypermarkets are the largest of our stores. We introduced the hypermarket format to Brazil with the opening of our first 7,000 square meter store in 1971. The

	Extra

	hypermarkets offer the widest
	assortment of products of any of our store formats, with approximately 70,000 items and an average selling area of 7,480 square meters at December 31, 2005. The

	Extra

	stores target the Brazilian class B, class C and class D household
	consumers, whose annual household income ranges from R$11,100 to R$56,000. At December 31, 2005, we had 79


	24









	Table of Contents




	Extra

	stores. The sale of food products represented 63.3% and non-food products represented 36.7% of

	Extra

	s net sales revenue in 2005.


	     In general, the year was dominated by the consolidation of initiatives and processes begun in previous years and whose results should become apparent in 2006. In addition to strengthening basic services, such as
	reducing checkout waiting periods and improving the quality of perishables,

	Extra

	stores also concentrated on more strategic aspects such as private-label and best-price products; means of payment (by putting greater emphasis on

	Extra

	credit cards); the creation of new services, such as digital photo development; expanding the gas stations and drug stores (currently raising the number of each to 52 and 117, respectively); and reinforcing the

	Cartão Presente

	(a
	gift-voucher card), which was restructured and will be relaunched in new format in 2006.


	     One of the years highlights was the introduction of

	Mundo Casa (Home World)

	, a space dedicated to homes uniting products from three categories  consumer electronics and home appliances,
	household/auto/gardening items and textiles. In order to give customers all the information they need, salespersons were trained in the knowledge of all the items involved.


	     Another pioneering initiative was a detailed customer profile survey, including data on the number of customers per store and frequency of their visits, allowing stores to adapt to changes in day-to-day customer
	behavior and

	Extra

	stores to introduce specific neighborhood initiatives in order to increase sales.


	     The focus on perishables, which has become one of

	Extra

	s key features, also continued throughout the year with the creation of
	the third employee training module, which introduced new, standardized techniques designed to improve the quality with which these products are treated by staff, in turn improving competitiveness.


	     

	Extra Eletro

	stores are generally small showrooms that sell a broad range of home appliances and consumer electronic products. These stores had an average selling area of 674 square meters at December 31, 2005.
	Customers place orders in the stores, and products are shipped from a central warehouse. At December 31, 2005 we had 50

	Extra Eletro

	stores, all of which are in the state of São Paulo.


	     In 2005,

	Extra-Eletro

	closed the year with 50 stores and gross sales of R$ 305.0 million. The focus of the year was the street stores that were subjected to changes in layout and product mix in order to increase
	their sales and profitability. Also, we launched a pilot project in a single store, in which a space was dedicated to homes, in line with the hypermarket concept of Mundo Casa (Home World). This involved the introduction of categories not normally
	associated with such stores, such as decorative items and textiles. Geared towards the B and C income groups, consumer electronics and home appliances are expected to account for 70% of sales and the new products for the remaining 30%.



	Capital Expansion and Investment Plan



	     As part of our capital expansion and investment plan, we have invested approximately R$3.6 billion in our operations since 2001. Our investments have included:


	     

	Acquisitions of supermarket and hypermarket chains

	 Since 2001, we have acquired and merged 172 stores, consisting of numerous supermarket chains and individual stores. Through our acquisition of the

	Barateiro

	chain in 1998, we inaugurated a new store format targeted specifically to lower income consumers. In addition, when entering new markets, we have generally sought to acquire local supermarket chains to benefit from their existing
	know-how of the geographic region. As a result, these acquisitions have enabled us to expand our operations to locations outside of the state of São Paulo, particularly Rio de Janeiro and some northeastern Brazilian states.


	     We acquired the Sé Supermercados chain of supermarkets in 2002. The purchase price was R$386.4 million, including the assumption of debt in the amount of R$124.4 million. On January 23, 2003, we sold the
	Sé trade name for R$0.3 million, as requested by the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE), the principal Brazilian antitrust authority. We have spent an aggregate of R$415.6 million on acquisitions since 2001.


	     The following table presents information regarding these acquisitions and the regional distribution of the stores we acquired over the past five years:

	Opening of new stores

	 As part of our expansion strategy, we have opened 68 new stores since 2001, including 19

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores, 20

	CompreBem

	stores, 20

	Extra

	stores, 8

	Extra Eletro

	stores, and 1

	Sendas

	store. The total cost of these new stores was R$1,091.4 million. We seek real estate properties for constructing or renovating stores under one of our banners in regions where there are no
	local supermarket chain acquisition opportunities that suits one of our formats. We also tend to enter new regional markets with the construction of a hypermarket.



	     Renovation of existing stores 

	We have remodeled

	Pão de Açúcar,


	CompreBem


	Barateiro,


	Extra

	stores,

	Sendas

	and

	Extra Eletro

	stores every year. Our renovation program allows us to add refrigeration equipment to our stores, create a more modern, customer-friendly and efficient environment, and outfit our stores with advanced
	information systems. The total cost of renovating these stores was R$1,366.1 million.


	     

	Improvements to information technology

	 We have been committed to technology as an important component in our pursuit of greater efficiency and security in the flow of information among stores, distribution
	centers, suppliers and corporate headquarters. We implemented a computer automated ordering system, which automatically replenishes our inventory based on consumers shopping habits. We have a proprietary technology system, the

	pd@net

	,
	a B-2-B, or business to business, platform for the on-line integration of approximately 7,000 suppliers. This Internet process enables information to be exchanged rapidly, precisely and transparently among all participants in the supply chain. For
	more information, see  Technology. We have spent an aggregate of R$415.2 million on information technology since 2001.


	     

	Expansion of distribution facilities

	 Since 2001, we have opened distribution centers in the cities of São Paulo, Brasília, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro and Recife. The increase and improvement
	in storage space enables us to further centralize purchasing for our stores and, together with improvements to our information technology, improve the overall efficiency of our inventory flow. We have spent an aggregate of R$103.1 million on our
	distribution facilities since 2001.

	     CBD invested R$ 899.6 million in 2005, mostly in opening new stores and remodeling the 60

	Sendas

	stores, which were totally renovated and adapted to our standards. Another portion went towards the advance
	purchase of strategic sites that will form part of our Investment Plan in the next two years.


	     Annual organic growth in 2005 was strong, with the inauguration of seven

	Extra

	hypermarkets and eight supermarkets, seven

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores and one

	CompreBem

	store, as well
	as eight gas stations and 42 drug stores. We also acquired the

	Coopercitrus

	chain, located in the midwest of São Paulo state, with gross sales of R$ 154.0 million in 2004. The six stores and three gas stations were converted to the

	CompreBem

	format.


	     In addition to being remodeled and upgraded, three

	ABC Barateiro

	stores were converted to the

	Sendas

	format during the year, and 12

	Pão de Açúcar

	stores were converted to the

	CompreBem

	format. Information technology and logistics investments involved, respectively, the substitution of hardware and software and the upgrading and renovation of the distribution centers.


	     In 2006 and 2007, the Company plans to open 16 to 20 hypermarkets and 40 to 60 supermarkets, which should increase sales by 6% to 8% per year.


	     Our Board of Directors approved the Investment Plan for 2006 totaling R$935.0 million in the year, earmarked for opening new stores, gas stations and drugstores; site acquisitions; renovations and maintenance of
	existing assets.





	Supply and Distribution



	     

	Supply

	. We have centralized purchasing for our

	Pão de Açúcar

	,

	CompreBem

	, Extra and Extra Eletro stores. We purchase substantially all of our food products on a spot or
	short-term basis from unaffiliated suppliers. In the aggregate, we purchase up to 170,000 products from approximately 10,000 suppliers. In 2005, no single supplier accounted for more than 6% of total goods purchased. Our 10 largest suppliers in
	2005 collectively accounted for 28% of our purchases, and we believe that we are not dependent on any single supplier.


	     

	Distribution

	. In order to distribute perishable food products, grocery items and general merchandise efficiently, we operate 18 distribution centers strategically located within the cities of São Paulo,
	Brasília, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro and Recife, with a total storage capacity of 380,000 square meters of built-in area. We were the first retailer in Brazil to have a centralized distribution center. The locations of our
	distribution centers make it possible for us to make frequent shipments to stores, which reduce the need of in-store stockroom space, and limits non-productive store inventories. CBD has an efficient logistics operation, with an 83% centralization
	level, which enables it to have lower logistics costs and higher productivity gains. In addition, the higher productivity is related to recent investments in new distribution centers: flowers, fish, frozen products, fruits and vegetables. This
	performance has enabled the Company to operate the supply chain with the lowest costs of its history.


	     In 2005, our distribution centers focused on reducing expenses by developing initiatives aimed at adding value and cutting logistics costs.


	     One such initiative was the structuring of the distribution network, which involved more suppliers delivering their goods to the regional distribution centers, thereby strengthening the regionalization process and
	reducing CBDs freight costs. Another was the introduction of more compact loads, enabling trucks to carry a


	27









	Table of Contents



	greater volume of merchandise, in turn reducing the number of trips. Logistics costs were further trimmed by streamlining operating processes within the distribution centers, which increased productivity and rationalized workforce numbers.


	     In addition, monitoring procedures were introduced, which led to a substantial decline in the out-of-stock index, the national benchmarking level. Aside from the reduction itself, the initiatives also focused on
	processes that resulted in more efficient controls over breakages involving those products with the highest turnover.


	     Relationships with suppliers were strengthened by the consolidation of our Top Log suppliers certification system, which ranks suppliers and helps develop a better relationship between CBD and its suppliers,,
	which generated strong results. Meetings were held with more than 60 suppliers, during which CBD was able to broaden its knowledge of their logistics, while suppliers also improved their understanding of our distribution and logistics, enabling the
	development of several joint process-improvement initiatives. At the end of the year, 13 suppliers were certified as having achieved the proposed objectives, which were based on indicators related to level of service, out-of-stock indicators and
	joint projects.


	     In addition to strengthening the supply framework in the Northeast, with the construction of a new distribution center for grocery and non-food items and the remodeling of the old facility which was turned into a
	perishable center, we also tripled the capacity of our seafood center. Previously limited to supplying 30

	Extra

	stores in São Paulo state, the seafood operation now covers all stores, including in other states. The flower center,
	located in Holambra, in the state of São Paulo, was also expanded to and began to supply Rio de Janeiro.



	Marketing



	     Our marketing strategy is to further enhance the quality image of our stores and to emphasize our selection and service and our competitive and fair prices. Each store banner executes its own marketing strategy designed
	to promote its particular strengths and to appeal to its customer base. In 2005 and 2004, we spent approximately R$202.3 million and R$260.5 million, respectively, on advertising (approximately 1.5% of total net sales revenues in each year).


	     We spent 36.0% in 2005 and 22.0% in 2004 of our total marketing expenditures on radio, newspaper and magazine advertising. In addition, television accounted for 25.9% of advertising expenses in 2005 and 30.2% in 2004.
	We spent 38.1% in 2005 and 47.8% in 2004 on other promotional activities.




	     We centralize the purchasing of advertising time or space for all of our stores, which enables us to reduce marketing expenditures. CBD cancelled all its contracts with outside marketing agencies and concentrated all
	publicity activities for its store banners in the hands of PA Publicidade, an agency belonging to the Group. While our primary advertising focus is on specific brand name, price, and quality-related promotions, we also regularly promote our store
	brands through sponsorships and sporting and cultural events, endorsements and support of environmental activities.


	     We have further developed our marketing initiatives through the

	Pão de Açúcar Mais

	card, the first preferred shopper/fidelity relationship card in the Brazilian retail industry, and the

	Clube CompreBem

	card. Through these programs we continue to collect customer information in an effort to offer more personalized services and products to shoppers who use our stores. We have also developed a private label strategy pursuant to
	which our various stores sell high quality products at competitive prices. The principal advantages of this private label strategy have been improved brand loyalty to our brands and increased leverage with our suppliers because our private label
	products are similar in quality to, but more favorably priced than, leading brands.



	Credit Sales



	     In 2005, 49.6% of our net sales revenue were represented by credit sales in the form of credit card sales, installment sales, post-dated checks and purchase vouchers. In 2004, 48.0% of our net sales revenue was
	represented by credit sales.


	     

	Credit card sales

	. All our store formats accept payment for purchases with MasterCard

	(Credicard)

	, Visa, Diners Club, American Express or our co-branded credit cards. We also offer private label credit
	cards, whose use is limited to our stores. Sales to customers using credit cards accounted for 37.1% of our net sales revenue in 2005. In 2004, sales through credit cards accounted for 36.5% of our net sales revenue. An allowance for doubtful


	28









	Table of Contents



	accounts is not required as credit risks are substantially assumed by third parties. Our Itaú CBD partnership provides credit products and services at CBDs stores, which involves private label and co-branded credit cards.


	     

	Installment sales

	. Our

	Extra


	Eletro

	stores and

	Extra

	hypermarkets offer attractive consumer financing to our customers who frequently purchase electronic goods or home appliances,
	respectively, on an installment basis. The consumer credit installment term in 2005 averaged 10 months, with fixed interest payments averaging approximately 4.0% per month throughout 2005. We borrow funds approximately equivalent to the consumer
	credit financing we extend through our sales of electronics. The consumer financing is generally for a term of up to 24 months and is funded by our borrowing on a shorter-term basis at fixed rates. In 2005, installment sales accounted for 2% of our
	total net sales revenue.


	     

	Post-dated checks

	. Post-dated checks are commonly used financial instruments in Brazil to make purchases. Post-dated checks are executed by a consumer with a future date (up to 90 days) instead of the date of
	the purchase. The retailer typically deposits the check only as of this future date, and interest for the time elapsed is included in the amount of the check. We currently have post-dated check programs in which interest is computed on the
	settlement amount based upon a fixed monthly rate of interest (to a lesser extent, for certain promotional programs no interest is charged). We limit the availability of post-dated checks to customers who meet our credit criteria and who hold our
	identification card. Over 380,000 customers use the programs on at least a monthly basis. Sales to customers using post-dated checks accounted for 3.0% of our net sales revenue in 2005 (4.4% in 2004).


	     As part of the credit approval process, we require each customer to complete a credit application. The applicant must also provide a taxpayers identification number, identification card, proof of residential
	address and current pay stub or other evidence of income as part of the application process. We then run a credit check with local credit reporting services and with SPC and SERASA, both of which are national credit reporting services, to determine
	a credit limit. We also input the data regarding the client and any purchases into our database.




	     

	Purchase vouchers

	. We accept as payment in our stores vouchers issued by third party agents to participating companies who provide them to their employees as a fringe benefit. Purchase vouchers accounted for
	7.5% of our net sales revenue in 2005, compared to 7.1% in 2004. An allowance for doubtful accounts is not required as credit risks are substantially assumed by third parties.



	Technology



	     We have been at the forefront of the Brazilian retail industry in using information technology. We were one of the first supermarket chains in Brazil to equip its stores with a POS system and the first major food
	retailer in Brazil to equip every one of its checkouts with this technology. We invested R$63.3 million in technology in 2005 and R$69.9 million in 2004.


	     Considered an important competitive advantage, information technology operates in harmony with our strategic guidelines, seeking solutions and tools to sustain and simplify internal processes. Aligned with the changes
	undergone by CBD during the year, the area played a fundamental role in the integration of the Commercial and Category Management areas.


	     The main goal was to furnish a package of instruments and aids which, in addition to providing support, would transform the new business models proposed changes into reality. With this in mind, systems and tools
	were developed which would allow the two areas to work together and have access to the same information, with the same indicators, ensuring transparency in commercial relations, cost and margin calculations, etc.


	     In the Business Intelligence area, the team came up with a new type of intelligence gathering tool, which allows us to analyze the prices of all our competitors in all the leading cities. Its novelty lies in the
	enhancement of the interface with the database, which already existed, but was endowed with a wider range of consultative and graphic features, allowing managers and executives to broaden their analytical spectrum.


	     The area handled the updating of more than 9,000 points-of-sales machines in the entire Group and the migration of 4,500 software programs from DOS to Linux, allowing CBD to expand the applications of these machines to
	include even more front-line services to its customers.


	     Another highlight was the implantation of new budget planning system that can be updated on-line. In addition to integrating the Sales, Category Management and Commercial areas, it also allowed these areas to carry


	29









	Table of Contents



	out their planning activities with greater ease and speed.


	     On the innovation front, studies into the application of smart tags moved ahead, with the development of the first pilot project using this technology in the Latin American retail sector. CBD was also the first
	supermarket company to offer its customers

	wifi

	(wireless broadband internet access), now available in

	20 Pão de Açúcar

	stores, and was responsible for installing Brazils first self check-out facility, in the

	Pão de Açúcar

	store in Real Parque in the state of São Paulo. This allows consumers to make their own product bar-code readings and pay for their purchases, without the need for check-out personnel.



	Competition



	     The Brazilian food retailing business is highly competitive and has experienced consolidation in recent years. In 2005, the three largest food retailers in Brazil accounted for 38.0% of the organized sector sales, which
	consist of sales by companies enrolled in ABRAS, Brazils supermarket association. In 2005, we accounted for 15.2% of the organized sector sales according to ABRAS. We believe that consolidation will continue to take place, not only within the
	food retail market but also other segments of the retail industry. For example, hypermarkets are expected to gain market share in apparel, general merchandise, consumer electronics, furniture, home development and other non-food categories because
	of a general lack of department stores and specialized stores in Brazil. We have continued our growth strategy by focusing on regions where we can reinforce our presence. As part of our expansion strategy, we have also focused on the needs and
	expectations of different consumers by developing store formats that respond to different household income levels. Although we operate stores in many regions throughout Brazil, the size, wealth and importance of the São Paulo State have led
	us to concentrate our stores in this particular market. In 2005, sales in São Paulo State accounted for 60% of our total sales. In São Paulo State and throughout Brazil, we compete principally on the basis of location, price, image,
	quality and service. In the retail food market, our competition includes hypermarkets, supermarkets and traditional wholesalers. Our principal competitors are multinational retail food chains, local supermarkets and grocery stores.


	     The main competitor of our

	Extra

	hypermarket is

	Carrefour

	, a leading French retail food chain, which at December 31, 2005 operated 399 retail stores principally in the southeast and south of Brazil. At
	December 31, 2005,

	Carrefour

	accounted for 11.8% of the organized sectors sales according to data from ABRAS.

	Wal-Mart

	, which as of December 31, 2005 operated 295 stores in Brazil, is also a competitor in the hypermarket and
	supermarket format with an 11.0% market share.


	     

	Pão de Açúcar

	has different competitors in each of the markets where we operate. In São Paulo State, we compete principally with a number of local supermarkets and grocery stores such
	as Sonda, Pastorinho, Carrefour, Mambo, Futurama and Wal-Mart. The main competitor of

	Pão de Açúcar

	in Brasília is Champion, the supermarket division of

	Carrefour,

	Super Maia, Super Cei and Big Box. In the
	state of Rio de Janeiro, our

	Pão de Açúcar

	format competes with Supermercados Mundial and Zona Sul. In Paraíba, Pernambuco, Ceará and Piauí, our main competitors are local supermarkets and
	Bompreço (Wal-Mart).




	     

	CompreBem - Sendas

	also faces different competitors depending on the particular regional market. In the state of São Paulo,

	CompreBem

	faces strong competition from a number of smaller regional
	chains. The main competitors of

	CompreBem - Sendas

	in the state of Rio de Janeiro are Guanabara, Champion and Mundial.




	     In other regional markets, we compete within the organized food retail sector as well as against several medium and small chains and family-owned and operated food retail businesses, which are estimated to represent
	approximately 50% of overall food sales in Brazil. Other organized food retail chains among our competitors include

	Sonae

	and

	Bompreço

	, owned by

	Wal-Mart

	in Brazil.




	     The principal competitors of our

	Extra Eletro

	stores are Casas Bahia and Ponto Frio (Globex), each of which operates in São Paulo State.


	     Other U.S. and international retailers may enter into the Brazilian retail market, either directly, by forming joint ventures or by acquiring existing chains. Some of these potential competitors may have greater
	financial resources than us. Moreover, to the extent that other large international food retailers enter the Brazilian market or


	30









	Table of Contents



	the retail sector continues to consolidate through the acquisition of local supermarket chains, our market share may be adversely affected.



	Regulatory Matters



	     We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulation and supervision generally applicable to companies engaged in business in Brazil, including federal, state and municipal regulation, such as labor laws, public
	health and environmental laws. In order to open and operate our stores, we need a business permit and site approval, an inspection certificate from the local fire department as well as health and safety permits. Our stores are subject to inspection
	by city authorities. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable statutory and administrative regulations with respect to our business.


	     Our business is primarily affected by a set of consumer protection rules regulating matters such as advertising, labeling and consumer credit. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these consumer
	protection regulations.


	     As a result of significant inflation during long periods in the past, it is commonly the practice in Brazil not to label individual items. Currently, there exists uncertainty regarding the requirement for price
	labeling each individual item. This uncertainty derives from a conflict between federal and state laws on the subject. State laws allow other pricing methods, such as the posting of signs and the placement of scanners for bar codes, which are the
	prevailing commercial practices. If the conflict is not resolved in a manner consistent with our current pricing practices and we are compelled to place price tags on each individual item, we would lose flexibility in carrying out our sales and may
	incur increased labor costs in connection with the affixing of price tags. However, we do not believe that our business would be adversely affected in a material way.


	     The Brazilian Congress is considering a bill requiring a prior assessment of the impact of the construction of a hypermarket in excess of 1,000 square meters on the relevant neighborhood. The proposed regulation is
	intended to protect traditional family-owned retailers that have increasingly lost market share in Brazil to the larger chains and hypermarkets. Regulations of this type already exist at the municipal level. For example, governmental authorities in
	the city of Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul issued a city ordinance in January 2001 prohibiting construction of food retail stores with a selling area greater than 1,500 square meters, which in May 2005, was amended as to increase
	from 1,500 to 2,500 squares meters the selling area of food retail stores. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws, and, if the bill pending before the Brazilian Congress becomes law, our future expansion and growth may be subject to significant
	constraints.


	     

	4C.




	Organizational Structure



	     Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição conducts our operations. Our investments in subsidiaries are effected primarily to acquire the share capital of other retail chains from third parties. In most cases,
	the retail operations are transferred to retail stores under existing banners or the stores acquired begin operating under our banners. All our operations are conducted under the

	Pão de Açúcar

	,

	CompreBem, Sendas, Extra
	and


	Extra


	Eletro

	banners.


	     

	4D.




	Property, Plant and Equipment



	     We own 47 stores, seven warehouses and a part of our headquarters. The remaining 509 stores and 6 warehouses we operate and the remainder of our headquarters are leased. Leases are usually for a term of five to 25
	years, and provide for monthly rent payments based on a percentage of sales above an agreed minimum value. We have 47 leases expiring in 2006. Based on our prior experience and Brazilian law and leasing practices, we do not anticipate any material
	change in the general terms of our leases or any material difficulty in renewing them. As of December 31, 2005, we leased 21 properties from members of the Diniz family and 60 stores from Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Península.
	Management believes that these leases are on terms at least as favorable to us as we could get from an unrelated party. See Item 7B  Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions  Related Party Transactions  Leases.
