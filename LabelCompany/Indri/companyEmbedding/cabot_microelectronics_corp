History[edit]
Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a "carbon black making apparatus".[citation needed] The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960.[3][better source needed]
In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials.[4][better source needed] This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants,[5] for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996.
In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company’s Aerogel business.[6][7] In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons.[2] In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.[8]
Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd.[9]
Safety, health and environmental[edit]
Safety record[edit]
The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years.[10] However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety.[11][better source needed]
Environmental record[edit]
Sam Bodman, CEO of Cabot during the coltan boom, was appointed in December 2004 to serve as President Bush’s Secretary of Energy. Under Bodman’s leadership from 1987 to 2000, according to Jason Leopold, Cabot was one of the U.S.’s largest polluters, accounting for 60,000 tons of airborne toxic emissions annually.[12]
Cabot reduced its Environmental Non-Conformance events (ENCs), from a high of over 80 incidences in 2008, to 17 in FY 2012.[13][better source needed] The company defines an environmental non-conformance event as a reportable spill or release, a Notice of Violation, a public complaint or certain permit deviations.
The company invested over $35 million in FY 2011 on environmentally-related capital projects to improve efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance. The company’s goal is a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year. One example of greenhouse gas reduction is a heat recovery advancement project to convert exhaust heat to steam at the company’s fumed metal oxides plant in Rheinfelden, Germany. The steam produced is used in the plant if needed or sold to a neighboring company. The project has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1,400 MTs each year.[14][better source needed]
Responsible care[edit]
In 2010 Cabot joined the American Chemistry Council,[15] and as such is obliged to implement the Council’s Responsible Care program as part of a global initiative.[16] Cabot is implementing RC 14001, which incorporates the requirements of both the ACC Responsible Care and the ISO 14001 Management Systems, for all its manufacturing facilities, beginning with those in North America.[17]
Sustainability[edit]
Cabot’s 2010/2011 sustainability report, titled "Sustainability Matters: Cabot Corporation’s 2010/2011 Sustainability Report," met all the informational requirements to receive an Application Level C certification from the Global Reporting Initiatives. Cabot’s adherence to GRI reporting standards affirms its commitment to more transparent and thorough reporting.[18]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Cabot Corporation was selected as a Bronze Winner for the Ninth Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards.[19] They were also selected as one of CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2012.[20]
The American Chemistry Council honored Cabot with the Responsible Care Performance Award in April 2012 for helping the ACC meet industry-wide safety and product stewardship targets.[21] In April 2012, Cabot ranked forty-fourth among the top 100 leading companies that demonstrated superior management, mitigation and adaptation in the field of climate innovation.[22][23] Cabot was awarded a 2012 Leadership Award for the Massachusetts Excellence in Commuter Options Awards.[24]
Board of Directors[edit]
Cabot Corporation’s Board of Directors is chaired by non-executive John F. O'Brien, retired President and Chief Executive Officer Allmerica Financial Corp.[25][26]
Cabot Foundation[edit]
In 1953, the non-profit Cabot Corporation Foundation, Inc. was established, and the Foundation's charter was amended in 1992 to permit grants to qualified charitable organizations outside of the United States.[27][better source needed] Cabot has offered aid to earthquake victims in Japan,[28] and the Outward Bound organization.[29]

History[edit]
Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a "carbon black making apparatus".[citation needed] The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960.[3][better source needed]
In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials.[4][better source needed] This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants,[5] for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996.
In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company’s Aerogel business.[6][7] In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons.[2] In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.[8]
Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd.[9]
Safety, health and environmental[edit]
Safety record[edit]
The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years.[10] However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety.[11][better source needed]

History[edit]
Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a "carbon black making apparatus".[citation needed] The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960.[3][better source needed]
In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials.[4][better source needed] This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants,[5] for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996.
In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company’s Aerogel business.[6][7] In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons.[2] In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.[8]
Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd.[9]
Safety, health and environmental[edit]
Safety record[edit]
The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years.[10] However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety.[11][better source needed]
Environmental record[edit]
Sam Bodman, CEO of Cabot during the coltan boom, was appointed in December 2004 to serve as President Bush’s Secretary of Energy. Under Bodman’s leadership from 1987 to 2000, according to Jason Leopold, Cabot was one of the U.S.’s largest polluters, accounting for 60,000 tons of airborne toxic emissions annually.[12]
Cabot reduced its Environmental Non-Conformance events (ENCs), from a high of over 80 incidences in 2008, to 17 in FY 2012.[13][better source needed] The company defines an environmental non-conformance event as a reportable spill or release, a Notice of Violation, a public complaint or certain permit deviations.
The company invested over $35 million in FY 2011 on environmentally-related capital projects to improve efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance. The company’s goal is a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year. One example of greenhouse gas reduction is a heat recovery advancement project to convert exhaust heat to steam at the company’s fumed metal oxides plant in Rheinfelden, Germany. The steam produced is used in the plant if needed or sold to a neighboring company. The project has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1,400 MTs each year.[14][better source needed]
Responsible care[edit]
In 2010 Cabot joined the American Chemistry Council,[15] and as such is obliged to implement the Council’s Responsible Care program as part of a global initiative.[16] Cabot is implementing RC 14001, which incorporates the requirements of both the ACC Responsible Care and the ISO 14001 Management Systems, for all its manufacturing facilities, beginning with those in North America.[17]
Sustainability[edit]
Cabot’s 2010/2011 sustainability report, titled "Sustainability Matters: Cabot Corporation’s 2010/2011 Sustainability Report," met all the informational requirements to receive an Application Level C certification from the Global Reporting Initiatives. Cabot’s adherence to GRI reporting standards affirms its commitment to more transparent and thorough reporting.[18]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Cabot Corporation was selected as a Bronze Winner for the Ninth Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards.[19] They were also selected as one of CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2012.[20]
The American Chemistry Council honored Cabot with the Responsible Care Performance Award in April 2012 for helping the ACC meet industry-wide safety and product stewardship targets.[21] In April 2012, Cabot ranked forty-fourth among the top 100 leading companies that demonstrated superior management, mitigation and adaptation in the field of climate innovation.[22][23] Cabot was awarded a 2012 Leadership Award for the Massachusetts Excellence in Commuter Options Awards.[24]
Board of Directors[edit]
Cabot Corporation’s Board of Directors is chaired by non-executive John F. O'Brien, retired President and Chief Executive Officer Allmerica Financial Corp.[25][26]
Cabot Foundation[edit]
In 1953, the non-profit Cabot Corporation Foundation, Inc. was established, and the Foundation's charter was amended in 1992 to permit grants to qualified charitable organizations outside of the United States.[27][better source needed] Cabot has offered aid to earthquake victims in Japan,[28] and the Outward Bound organization.[29]

                            "The service was great, with a reasonable price and great results. We have now started using another supplier from China. We just ordered our first container from the new supplier and with the savings it more than paid for the ImportGenius.com service on the first container load."

Cabot Microelectronics Dominated CMP Slurry Revenues In 2016 While Versum Materials Slid - Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (NASDAQ:CCMP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cabot Microelectronics Dominated CMP Slurry Revenues In 2016 While Versum Materials SlidMar.20.17 | About: Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) Robert Castellano Chipmakers, solar, macro, research analystThe Information NetworkSummaryCabot Microelectronics led the semiconductor CMP slurry business with a market share more than twice that of its closest competitor in 2016.Versum Materials slid from second place to third as it lost share to Japanese suppliers Hitachi Chemical, Fujimi and FijiFilm.Cabot Microelectronics and Versum Materials lost market share to Asian slurry suppliers in 2016. Chemical Mechanical Planarization (NYSE:CMP) is a process used in semiconductor manufacturing whereby the surface of the wafer is leveled and smoothed using abrasive slurries. The process is used following every deposition-etch step and is critical to precise lithography patterning. One of the growth drivers for CMP slurry is 3D NAND and 3D FinFET devices. I noted in a January 26, 2017 Seeking Alpha article entitled "Applied Materials: 42% Exposure To EUV Lithography Will Stunt Long-Term Growth" that: "Current DUV immersion is viable for processing devices with 30nm features. Below that, engineers employ multiple patterning steps as a way of extending the DUV lithography tool. These multiple processing steps are deposition-etch intensively, utilizing equipment from Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) (and others). In other words, semiconductor manufacturers are utilizing multiple patterning processes, requiring extensive use of deposition and etch equipment, to avoid purchasing the extremely expensive EUV lithography equipment." So until EUV becomes production worthy over the next couple of years when the 7nm node is reached, CMP will benefit from the extension of immersion DUV using multiple patterning. EUV will only be utilized in the foreseeable future by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), TSMC and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF). Unfortunately Cabot Microelectronics (NASDAQ:CCMP) has a 30% exposure to EUV because TSMC and Samsung each accounted for approximately 15% of revenue in 2016. But again, the impact of EUV on CCMP is long term. According to our report entitled "CMP Technology: Competition, Products, Markets," Cabot Microelectronics maintained its dominance in the CMP slurry business, although market share dropped one point. The company is facing competition from Korean CMP slurry companies KC Tech, Soulbrain, and Cheil for its position at Samsung Electronics. According to the report, Versum Materials (NYSE:VSM) dropped from second to third place in the CMP market as the company was replaced at the number two position by Hitachi Chemical. Versum lost more than one point in share not only to Hitachi Chemical, but to other Japanese suppliers Fujimi and FijiFilm. VSM's exposure to EUV is even worse. In fiscal 2016, Intel, Samsung, and TSMC accounted for 47% of sales. These are company-wide sales, not just CMP slurry, as the company does not transparently provide these type of data. Versum officially spun off from Air Products (NYSE:APD) on October 1, 2016, and then began operations as an independent, public company. Prior to the spin off, the company operated as DA Nanomaterials, which had been a joint venture between APD and DuPont (NYSE:DD) until APD purchased DD's 50% share in 2012. I discussed the spin off in a December 1, 2015 Seeking Alpha article entitled "Air Products - The More Things Change The More They Remain The Same." Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) maintained sixth place behind the above mentioned companies. Investor takeaway CCMP is one of the original suppliers of CMP slurry, having spun off of Cabot Corp (NYSE:CBT) in 2000. It has an established customer base and counts TSMC and Samsung Electronics among its largest customers. It lost market share in the past in the copper slurry business but continues to be strong in Tungsten and Dielectric slurries. The company continues to grow organically and through acquisitions, particularly in the CMP pad business. VSM is strong in Copper slurries and is focusing on enhancing its shallow trench isolation (NYSE:STI) slurry product, but the STI slurry sector is dominated by Hitachi Chemical and other companies such as Ferro Corp. (NYSE:FOE) are also working on improving their STI product. VSM has a strong customer base in Asia, but competition from Japanese and Korean slurry suppliers is eroding market share.
