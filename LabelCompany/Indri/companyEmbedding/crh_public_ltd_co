CRH's diverse product range services the breadth of construction needs Find out more about Our Operations




 Heavyside Materials Heavyside Products Lightside Products Distribution 





CRH operates strong vertically-integrated heavyside materials businesses which have strategically located long-term reserves.















Structural elements to construct the building frame and value-added exterior products that enhance the built environment.















Innovative and highly-engineered products that close the building envelope and that provide expert solutions for construction projects.















Distribution channels which service construction fit-out and renewal.
















Delivering a balanced business  Our unique balance across regions, products and all building and construction sectors is one of the key drivers of CRH strategy. The Group’s relentless focus on performance, our multiple growth platforms from which to pursue value-creating opportunities, our dedicated people with ambition to achieve, and the operating environment we have created which values strong governance and prudent policies, underpin the Group’s ability to deliver consistent performance. 





Regional and product balance CRH’s unique balance, both in terms of geographic spread and involvement across its three core businesses, smooths the effects of varying economic conditions and provides greater opportunities for growth. 





Sectoral balance CRH seeks to reduce the effects of varying demand patterns across building and construction end-use sectors by maintaining a balanced portfolio of products serving a broad customer base. End-use demand within the three construction sectors is divided between new build and repair, maintenance and improvement (RMI).  End-use balance, which tends to trend towards RMI in developed economies, is counter-balanced by significant new build demand in developing economies.

History[edit]
1970-1980s: Formation and listings[edit]
The company, whose name is an abbreviation of Cement Roadstone Holdings, was formed through the merger in 1970 of Cement Ltd (established in 1936) and Roadstone Ltd (established in 1949).[4] According to Jonathan Guthrie of the Financial Times, it is pronounced “Cee Orr Haitch.”[5] The company went public on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1973.[6]
CRH entered the United States in 1978 by buying Amcor, a concrete products group in Utah which would then form the basis of the company's U.S. division, which is now called Oldcastle Inc.. Subsequent large purchases in the US included Callanan Industries, a New York State based aggregates and asphalt producer in 1985.[7] In 1987, CRH was listed on London's FTSE 100 index.[8]
1990s: Early Europe and US acquisitions[edit]
In the 1990s the company moved into France with a number of buys including Raboni SA, a builders merchant company and drainage systems and concrete vault manufacturing group Prefaest SA.[9]
In 1995, CRH made its first entry into new or emerging markets when it bought Holding Cement Polski, which later gained majority control of Cementownia Ozarow, one of the Poland's major cement producers.[10] That acquisition also marked the first CRH cement manufacturing operation outside Ireland. By the end of the decade, CRH numbered more than a dozen operations in Poland and it has since invested in cement production in neighbouring Ukraine,[11] most recently with the announcement of an agreement to buy Mykolaiv Cement from rival Lafarge.[12] In 1999 CRH bought Finnsementti Oy, Finland's only cement producer, and Lohja Rudus Oy, Finland's country's top producer of aggregates and ready-mix concrete.[13]
In the 1990s, US acquisitions by CRH included Betco Block & Products Inc, of Bethesda, Maryland in 1990.[14] CRH acquired Balf Co. in Connecticut, Lebanon Rock in Pennsylvania, Keating in Massachusetts and Sullivan Lafarge in New York state in 1994.[15] It acquired Allied Building Products, which specialized in roofing and cladding products and Tilcon, a major road construction specialist in the Northeast United States in 1996.[16]
2000-2010: Later acquisitions[edit]




CRH global production sites in 2010.


The company entered Switzerland in 2000 with the EUR 425 million purchase of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, as well as a regional distribution network.[17] In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav.[18] In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a market-leading do-it-yourself store chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands.[19] In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce [20]
In the United States, CRH also acquired Ohio's Shelly Group in 2000,[21] and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002[22] and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company's largest ever deal.[23] In 2007 CRH purchased four companies, worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc. (CYDI), Eugene Sand & Gravel, Cessford Construction and McMinn's Asphalt and Prospect Agrregates.[24] Also in 2008 CRH agreed to purchase a landscape paver, Pavestone, for $540 million.[25]
In 2006 CRH took a new turn and invested in a cement factory based in the Heilongjiang region in China.[26] It has built on that presence acquiring a 26% stake in the Jilin Yatai Group and an option to acquire 49% in the future.[27] In 2008 CRH agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Indian cement company My Home Industries Ltd. for €290 million ($452 million).[28]
2011-2017: Americas and emerging markets[edit]




Cement transport wagon of the French subsidiary (EQIOM)


CRH confirmed in 2013 that it was interested in looking at other opportunities in India.[29] n 2015, CRH remained listed in both London and Dublin.[30] In February 2015, CRH agreed to purchase the UK building materials producer Lafarge Tarmac.[31] In 2015, CRH purchased US $6.5 billion of assets from the newly formed company LafargeHolcim. The acquisition almost tripled CRH's net debt, bringing it to €6.6 billion.[32] The LafargeHolcim acquisition made CRH "the world’s third-largest building materials group by market value." A week after CEO Albert Manifold announced that CRH was looking for large-scale acquisitions, in August 2015, CRH paid $1.3 billion for CR Laurence, a glazing company based in California.[30] At the time, CRH already had a similar business in North America called BuildingEnvelope, with 4,500 employees, which it said it would integrate with CRL.[30] By November 2015, CRH was getting about a fifth of its operating earnings from US infrastructure.[33]
In June 2016, the Financial Times reported that CRH earned twice as much profit from the Americas versus Europe.[34] As of November 2016, half the asphalt, aggregates and assorted material it sold went to the United States.[32] Headquartered in Dublin, CRH was also the biggest producer of asphalt in the US, and the third largest producer of ready-mixed concrete.[35] Sales for 2016 were €27.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. Profit after tax was €1.3 billion.[8] In April 2017, the Irish Times noted that chief executive Albert Manifold’s package almost doubled in 2016 to €10 million, despite disagreement among shareholders the year before on pay.[36] As of April 27, 2017, CRH was Ireland's biggest company.[8][37] Chief executive was Albert Manifold. That quarter, sales were up in its three divisions in Europe, while the Americas materials unit had higher sales as well.[37] At the time, it did 65 percent of its business in the Americas, while the market in the Philippines proving to be "challenging," and weighing down performance in Asia.[38] On April 27, 2017, CRH held their annual general meeting in Dublin, at which point 17 percent of shareholders voted against the company's executive pay structure. The year prior, 40 percent had voted against. At the meeting, chairman Nick Hartery noted that share price in the company had increased 80 percent since 2014.[8] Also in April 2017, it was reported that CRH was expecting to make a large-scale acquisition in 2018. At the time, over the earlier part of the year CRH had spent €500 million on eight acquisitions.[39] In early May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in CRH plc.[40]

Controversy[edit]
Cartel accusations[edit]
Poland[edit]
In Poland in 2007, CRH was fined €530,000 by the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for interfering with evidence that Polish authorities were gathering for a price-fixing investigation.[46] In 2009, Grupa Ożarów (in which CRH first invested in 1995) was fined €26 million for operating a price fixing cartel in Poland.[47] The Polish Competition Regulator stated that seven companies, which accounted for almost 100 per cent of the market, had fixed minimum prices for grey cement, and agreed on a market share for each operator. CRH has stated its belief that Ozarów operated an independent commercial policy in Poland and the fine has been appealed.[48]
Ireland[edit]
In Ireland in 1994, Irish Cement Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRH, was determined by the European Commission to be part of price fixing and market sharing cartel across Europe which it said had illegally and artificially inflated the price of cement throughout the continent. A fine of over €3.5 million was levied.[49] Two years later, in Ireland also in 1996, High Court proceedings were initiated against CRH, its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused CRH and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anti-competitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business.[50] In 2012, CRH applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the "inordinate and inexcusable delay" in bringing forward any evidence in the case.[51] That judgement was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2012. At the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in CRH and was forced to stand down.[52] In 2011, a separate Irish High Court action was initiated against CRH by another company who claimed CRH operated a cartel and abused a position of dominance in order to evict it from the market.[citation needed] As of 2012, the Irish cement and concrete industry at large was under investigation by the Irish Competition Authority.[53]
United States[edit]
In 2006, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in California against Oldcastle Precast (CRH subsidiary) and three AT&T affiliates. The defendants were alleged to have unreasonably restrained trade and conspired to monopolize telephone vaults for land-line connections. Plaintiffs challenged a contract requiring developers to purchase Oldcastle Precast product for properties served by AT&T infrastructure. They also contended the arrangement led to Oldcastle Precast capturing northern California sales of precast electrical vaults, which were often placed concurrently with telephone structures. In 2010, an American Court of Appeal ruled that the Plaintiff’s counsel had failed to provide enough evidence to show that the defendants Oldcastle Precast Inc. and three AT&T affiliates harmed competition in California and Nevada telephone vault markets.[54]
In October 2009, a cement and concrete price fixing class action lawsuit was filed in Florida against Oldcastle Materials (CRH subsidiary) and others. The claim alleged that the defendants eliminated competition in the market for cement and concrete by charging artificially high prices from at least the period 2000 to 2009. The claim further alleged that the conspiracy was facilitated through in-personal meetings, telephone conversations and other communications. In 2008 the defendants announced uniform price increases for concrete and cement, bringing their prices to the same level at the same time, the lawsuit claimed. Then in September a number of defendant companies cut the price of concrete in an effort to lure customers away from independently owned concrete firms. The lawsuit stated that the practices alleged in the cement and concrete industry were clearly illegal.[55] In 2012, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.[56]
The largest cases in the USA seem to be in Florida 2009 to 2012 - price fixing / New Jersey for blowing up a mine in context of Federal Grant money potential frauds. However, the grandiose doings near Lake Deforest in New City / Dutchtown / Haverstraw and West Nyack, NY since about 2006 to 2017 are shocking but not surprising. One may obtain the latest Consent Order(s) by calling the new Region 3 Director, Kelly Turturro at 845-256-3033 and the DEC can put you in contact with Eric Kim of the DOW branch of the DEC for details about unpaid fines regarding testing/analysis that seems not to be viably done for many years (also in Consent Orders / last quarter 2015 DEC authored Haverstraw Quarry "Notice of Violation" dated Nov. 4, 2015 to some extent).
Allegations of corrupt payments to politicians[edit]
Poland[edit]
In 2005, a Polish businessman, Marek Dochnal, alleged to a Polish Parliamentary Inquiry that he had arranged a bribe of almost $1 million for CRH to a former minister for privatisation, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, in connection with the privatisation of a cement plant at Ozarow, in central Poland, in 1995.[57] CRH which now owns and operates the cement plant at Ozarow said the allegations were "without foundation".[58]
It was also revealed in 2005, that CRH contributed €125,000 to a charity founded by the wife of Poland’s President, Jolanta Kwasniewska. Both CRH and the Polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction.[59]
Ireland[edit]
In 2003, CRH was accused of making corrupt payments to Ireland’s former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles J. Haughey as details emerged of how Mr. Haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours. In 1969, Roadstone Ltd (CRH) sold 80 acres of land to Mr. Haughey, the then Minister of Finance, for £120,000. In 1973, Mr. Haughey sold 17.5 acres of that land back to CRH for £140,000. Within four years, Mr. Haughey had made a net profit of £20,000 and 62.5 acres at CRH’s expense.[60] Charles J. Haughey was also offered chairmanship of CRH in 1972.[61]
Illegal Ansbacher Bank[edit]
The existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in 1997 during the McCracken Tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry.[62]
It emerged this illegal bank was founded in the 1970s and was being run by Des Traynor who was chairman of CRH from 1989 to 1994 and who ran his bank during that period out of CRH’s registered office in Dublin's Fitzwilliam Square where the company provided an office for its chairman. Mr. Traynor was also personal financier to Charles Haughey.[63]
During the investigation it materialised that Justice Moriarty held approximately £500,000 in CRH shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning CRH he was not, he said, precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from Des Traynor's offices at Fitzwilliam Square[64] Sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing Moriarty given his shareholding[65]
In 1999, as evidence on the scale of the Ansbacher accounts grew Taniste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) and PD Minister Mary Harney asked the High Court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders.[66]
The High Court Inspectors' report was published in 2002[67] It found that eight out of fifteen CRH directors held Ansbacher accounts, including four former Chairmen.[68] It also concluded (Chapter 15, p. 189) that "CRH as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of Ansbacher’s activities in Ireland"[67]
After the publication of the report CRH acknowledged publicly that its then Chairman had "misused its facilities and personnel" which "represented a grave breach of trust by Mr. Traynor"[69]
Sale of Glen Ding Lands[edit]
In 1998, further questions were asked about CRH’s influence and political corruption when Dáil Éireann (Ireland’s Parliament) voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £48 million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to Roadstone, a subsidiary company of CRH, without public tender for £1.25 million in 1991.[70]
Many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale, Charles J. Haughey was Taoiseach and his financier Des Traynor was Chairman of CRH. Dáil Éireann however voted not to investigate whether CRH had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of Glen Ding. Subsequently, corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation.[71]
The State's Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell "far short of" the Roadstone offer and that "The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State" (Section 9.6). It did also note "even though it is unlikely that the Roadstone offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business" It was noted by the Department's Accounting Officer that the Roadstone offer "was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received", that another bidder "was afforded every opportunity" to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues "In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional".[72]
The Glen Ding transaction was further investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal which in 2006 reported its conclusion "that there was no connection, directly or indirectly, between Mr. Charles Haughey and any aspect of this disposal, nor any connection between the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal."[73]
Public criticism[edit]
In 2005, opposition TD (Teachta Dála - Irish member of parliament) Phil Hogan, who later became Minister for Environment (2011 - ), stated in Dáil Éireann that "there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………In the case of CRH, profits have been extracted from the Irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anti-competitive and anti-consumer. The European Court of First Instance and finally the European Court of Justice have upheld findings of serious anti-competitive behaviour against CRH and other. While Sweden, Finland, UK, France and Germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry, Ireland’s answer has been a stony silence."[74]
In 2011 TD Shane Ross, a repeated critic of CRH as a journalist stated that "CRH disturbs" him and questioned why there had been no investigation of CRH in Ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere.[75]

History[edit]
1970-1980s: Formation and listings[edit]
The company, whose name is an abbreviation of Cement Roadstone Holdings, was formed through the merger in 1970 of Cement Ltd (established in 1936) and Roadstone Ltd (established in 1949).[4] According to Jonathan Guthrie of the Financial Times, it is pronounced “Cee Orr Haitch.”[5] The company went public on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1973.[6]
CRH entered the United States in 1978 by buying Amcor, a concrete products group in Utah which would then form the basis of the company's U.S. division, which is now called Oldcastle Inc.. Subsequent large purchases in the US included Callanan Industries, a New York State based aggregates and asphalt producer in 1985.[7] In 1987, CRH was listed on London's FTSE 100 index.[8]
1990s: Early Europe and US acquisitions[edit]
In the 1990s the company moved into France with a number of buys including Raboni SA, a builders merchant company and drainage systems and concrete vault manufacturing group Prefaest SA.[9]
In 1995, CRH made its first entry into new or emerging markets when it bought Holding Cement Polski, which later gained majority control of Cementownia Ozarow, one of the Poland's major cement producers.[10] That acquisition also marked the first CRH cement manufacturing operation outside Ireland. By the end of the decade, CRH numbered more than a dozen operations in Poland and it has since invested in cement production in neighbouring Ukraine,[11] most recently with the announcement of an agreement to buy Mykolaiv Cement from rival Lafarge.[12] In 1999 CRH bought Finnsementti Oy, Finland's only cement producer, and Lohja Rudus Oy, Finland's country's top producer of aggregates and ready-mix concrete.[13]
In the 1990s, US acquisitions by CRH included Betco Block & Products Inc, of Bethesda, Maryland in 1990.[14] CRH acquired Balf Co. in Connecticut, Lebanon Rock in Pennsylvania, Keating in Massachusetts and Sullivan Lafarge in New York state in 1994.[15] It acquired Allied Building Products, which specialized in roofing and cladding products and Tilcon, a major road construction specialist in the Northeast United States in 1996.[16]
2000-2010: Later acquisitions[edit]




CRH global production sites in 2010.


The company entered Switzerland in 2000 with the EUR 425 million purchase of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, as well as a regional distribution network.[17] In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav.[18] In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a market-leading do-it-yourself store chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands.[19] In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce [20]
In the United States, CRH also acquired Ohio's Shelly Group in 2000,[21] and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002[22] and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company's largest ever deal.[23] In 2007 CRH purchased four companies, worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc. (CYDI), Eugene Sand & Gravel, Cessford Construction and McMinn's Asphalt and Prospect Agrregates.[24] Also in 2008 CRH agreed to purchase a landscape paver, Pavestone, for $540 million.[25]
In 2006 CRH took a new turn and invested in a cement factory based in the Heilongjiang region in China.[26] It has built on that presence acquiring a 26% stake in the Jilin Yatai Group and an option to acquire 49% in the future.[27] In 2008 CRH agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Indian cement company My Home Industries Ltd. for €290 million ($452 million).[28]
2011-2017: Americas and emerging markets[edit]

CRH confirmed in 2013 that it was interested in looking at other opportunities in India.[29] n 2015, CRH remained listed in both London and Dublin.[30] In February 2015, CRH agreed to purchase the UK building materials producer Lafarge Tarmac.[31] In 2015, CRH purchased US $6.5 billion of assets from the newly formed company LafargeHolcim. The acquisition almost tripled CRH's net debt, bringing it to €6.6 billion.[32] The LafargeHolcim acquisition made CRH "the world’s third-largest building materials group by market value." A week after CEO Albert Manifold announced that CRH was looking for large-scale acquisitions, in August 2015, CRH paid $1.3 billion for CR Laurence, a glazing company based in California.[30] At the time, CRH already had a similar business in North America called BuildingEnvelope, with 4,500 employees, which it said it would integrate with CRL.[30] By November 2015, CRH was getting about a fifth of its operating earnings from US infrastructure.[33]
In June 2016, the Financial Times reported that CRH earned twice as much profit from the Americas versus Europe.[34] As of November 2016, half the asphalt, aggregates and assorted material it sold went to the United States.[32] Headquartered in Dublin, CRH was also the biggest producer of asphalt in the US, and the third largest producer of ready-mixed concrete.[35] Sales for 2016 were €27.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. Profit after tax was €1.3 billion.[8] In April 2017, the Irish Times noted that chief executive Albert Manifold’s package almost doubled in 2016 to €10 million, despite disagreement among shareholders the year before on pay.[36] As of April 27, 2017, CRH was Ireland's biggest company.[8][37] Chief executive was Albert Manifold. That quarter, sales were up in its three divisions in Europe, while the Americas materials unit had higher sales as well.[37] At the time, it did 65 percent of its business in the Americas, while the market in the Philippines proving to be "challenging," and weighing down performance in Asia.[38] On April 27, 2017, CRH held their annual general meeting in Dublin, at which point 17 percent of shareholders voted against the company's executive pay structure. The year prior, 40 percent had voted against. At the meeting, chairman Nick Hartery noted that share price in the company had increased 80 percent since 2014.[8] Also in April 2017, it was reported that CRH was expecting to make a large-scale acquisition in 2018. At the time, over the earlier part of the year CRH had spent €500 million on eight acquisitions.[39] In early May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in CRH plc.[40]

Controversy[edit]
Cartel accusations[edit]
Poland[edit]
In Poland in 2007, CRH was fined €530,000 by the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for interfering with evidence that Polish authorities were gathering for a price-fixing investigation.[46] In 2009, Grupa Ożarów (in which CRH first invested in 1995) was fined €26 million for operating a price fixing cartel in Poland.[47] The Polish Competition Regulator stated that seven companies, which accounted for almost 100 per cent of the market, had fixed minimum prices for grey cement, and agreed on a market share for each operator. CRH has stated its belief that Ozarów operated an independent commercial policy in Poland and the fine has been appealed.[48]
Ireland[edit]
In Ireland in 1994, Irish Cement Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRH, was determined by the European Commission to be part of price fixing and market sharing cartel across Europe which it said had illegally and artificially inflated the price of cement throughout the continent. A fine of over €3.5 million was levied.[49] Two years later, in Ireland also in 1996, High Court proceedings were initiated against CRH, its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused CRH and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anti-competitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business.[50] In 2012, CRH applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the "inordinate and inexcusable delay" in bringing forward any evidence in the case.[51] That judgement was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2012. At the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in CRH and was forced to stand down.[52] In 2011, a separate Irish High Court action was initiated against CRH by another company who claimed CRH operated a cartel and abused a position of dominance in order to evict it from the market.[citation needed] As of 2012, the Irish cement and concrete industry at large was under investigation by the Irish Competition Authority.[53]
United States[edit]
In 2006, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in California against Oldcastle Precast (CRH subsidiary) and three AT&T affiliates. The defendants were alleged to have unreasonably restrained trade and conspired to monopolize telephone vaults for land-line connections. Plaintiffs challenged a contract requiring developers to purchase Oldcastle Precast product for properties served by AT&T infrastructure. They also contended the arrangement led to Oldcastle Precast capturing northern California sales of precast electrical vaults, which were often placed concurrently with telephone structures. In 2010, an American Court of Appeal ruled that the Plaintiff’s counsel had failed to provide enough evidence to show that the defendants Oldcastle Precast Inc. and three AT&T affiliates harmed competition in California and Nevada telephone vault markets.[54]
In October 2009, a cement and concrete price fixing class action lawsuit was filed in Florida against Oldcastle Materials (CRH subsidiary) and others. The claim alleged that the defendants eliminated competition in the market for cement and concrete by charging artificially high prices from at least the period 2000 to 2009. The claim further alleged that the conspiracy was facilitated through in-personal meetings, telephone conversations and other communications. In 2008 the defendants announced uniform price increases for concrete and cement, bringing their prices to the same level at the same time, the lawsuit claimed. Then in September a number of defendant companies cut the price of concrete in an effort to lure customers away from independently owned concrete firms. The lawsuit stated that the practices alleged in the cement and concrete industry were clearly illegal.[55] In 2012, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.[56]
The largest cases in the USA seem to be in Florida 2009 to 2012 - price fixing / New Jersey for blowing up a mine in context of Federal Grant money potential frauds. However, the grandiose doings near Lake Deforest in New City / Dutchtown / Haverstraw and West Nyack, NY since about 2006 to 2017 are shocking but not surprising. One may obtain the latest Consent Order(s) by calling the new Region 3 Director, Kelly Turturro at 845-256-3033 and the DEC can put you in contact with Eric Kim of the DOW branch of the DEC for details about unpaid fines regarding testing/analysis that seems not to be viably done for many years (also in Consent Orders / last quarter 2015 DEC authored Haverstraw Quarry "Notice of Violation" dated Nov. 4, 2015 to some extent).
Allegations of corrupt payments to politicians[edit]
Poland[edit]
In 2005, a Polish businessman, Marek Dochnal, alleged to a Polish Parliamentary Inquiry that he had arranged a bribe of almost $1 million for CRH to a former minister for privatisation, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, in connection with the privatisation of a cement plant at Ozarow, in central Poland, in 1995.[57] CRH which now owns and operates the cement plant at Ozarow said the allegations were "without foundation".[58]
It was also revealed in 2005, that CRH contributed €125,000 to a charity founded by the wife of Poland’s President, Jolanta Kwasniewska. Both CRH and the Polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction.[59]
Ireland[edit]
In 2003, CRH was accused of making corrupt payments to Ireland’s former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles J. Haughey as details emerged of how Mr. Haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours. In 1969, Roadstone Ltd (CRH) sold 80 acres of land to Mr. Haughey, the then Minister of Finance, for £120,000. In 1973, Mr. Haughey sold 17.5 acres of that land back to CRH for £140,000. Within four years, Mr. Haughey had made a net profit of £20,000 and 62.5 acres at CRH’s expense.[60] Charles J. Haughey was also offered chairmanship of CRH in 1972.[61]
Illegal Ansbacher Bank[edit]
The existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in 1997 during the McCracken Tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry.[62]
It emerged this illegal bank was founded in the 1970s and was being run by Des Traynor who was chairman of CRH from 1989 to 1994 and who ran his bank during that period out of CRH’s registered office in Dublin's Fitzwilliam Square where the company provided an office for its chairman. Mr. Traynor was also personal financier to Charles Haughey.[63]
During the investigation it materialised that Justice Moriarty held approximately £500,000 in CRH shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning CRH he was not, he said, precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from Des Traynor's offices at Fitzwilliam Square[64] Sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing Moriarty given his shareholding[65]
In 1999, as evidence on the scale of the Ansbacher accounts grew Taniste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) and PD Minister Mary Harney asked the High Court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders.[66]
The High Court Inspectors' report was published in 2002[67] It found that eight out of fifteen CRH directors held Ansbacher accounts, including four former Chairmen.[68] It also concluded (Chapter 15, p. 189) that "CRH as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of Ansbacher’s activities in Ireland"[67]
After the publication of the report CRH acknowledged publicly that its then Chairman had "misused its facilities and personnel" which "represented a grave breach of trust by Mr. Traynor"[69]
Sale of Glen Ding Lands[edit]
In 1998, further questions were asked about CRH’s influence and political corruption when Dáil Éireann (Ireland’s Parliament) voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £48 million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to Roadstone, a subsidiary company of CRH, without public tender for £1.25 million in 1991.[70]
Many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale, Charles J. Haughey was Taoiseach and his financier Des Traynor was Chairman of CRH. Dáil Éireann however voted not to investigate whether CRH had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of Glen Ding. Subsequently, corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation.[71]
The State's Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell "far short of" the Roadstone offer and that "The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State" (Section 9.6). It did also note "even though it is unlikely that the Roadstone offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business" It was noted by the Department's Accounting Officer that the Roadstone offer "was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received", that another bidder "was afforded every opportunity" to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues "In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional".[72]
The Glen Ding transaction was further investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal which in 2006 reported its conclusion "that there was no connection, directly or indirectly, between Mr. Charles Haughey and any aspect of this disposal, nor any connection between the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal."[73]
Public criticism[edit]
In 2005, opposition TD (Teachta Dála - Irish member of parliament) Phil Hogan, who later became Minister for Environment (2011 - ), stated in Dáil Éireann that "there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………In the case of CRH, profits have been extracted from the Irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anti-competitive and anti-consumer. The European Court of First Instance and finally the European Court of Justice have upheld findings of serious anti-competitive behaviour against CRH and other. While Sweden, Finland, UK, France and Germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry, Ireland’s answer has been a stony silence."[74]
In 2011 TD Shane Ross, a repeated critic of CRH as a journalist stated that "CRH disturbs" him and questioned why there had been no investigation of CRH in Ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere.[75]

History[edit]
1970-1980s: Formation and listings[edit]
The company, whose name is an abbreviation of Cement Roadstone Holdings, was formed through the merger in 1970 of Cement Ltd (established in 1936) and Roadstone Ltd (established in 1949).[4] According to Jonathan Guthrie of the Financial Times, it is pronounced “Cee Orr Haitch.”[5] The company went public on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1973.[6]
CRH entered the United States in 1978 by buying Amcor, a concrete products group in Utah which would then form the basis of the company's U.S. division, which is now called Oldcastle Inc.. Subsequent large purchases in the US included Callanan Industries, a New York State based aggregates and asphalt producer in 1985.[7] In 1987, CRH was listed on London's FTSE 100 index.[8]
1990s: Early Europe and US acquisitions[edit]
In the 1990s the company moved into France with a number of buys including Raboni SA, a builders merchant company and drainage systems and concrete vault manufacturing group Prefaest SA.[9]
In 1995, CRH made its first entry into new or emerging markets when it bought Holding Cement Polski, which later gained majority control of Cementownia Ozarow, one of the Poland's major cement producers.[10] That acquisition also marked the first CRH cement manufacturing operation outside Ireland. By the end of the decade, CRH numbered more than a dozen operations in Poland and it has since invested in cement production in neighbouring Ukraine,[11] most recently with the announcement of an agreement to buy Mykolaiv Cement from rival Lafarge.[12] In 1999 CRH bought Finnsementti Oy, Finland's only cement producer, and Lohja Rudus Oy, Finland's country's top producer of aggregates and ready-mix concrete.[13]
In the 1990s, US acquisitions by CRH included Betco Block & Products Inc, of Bethesda, Maryland in 1990.[14] CRH acquired Balf Co. in Connecticut, Lebanon Rock in Pennsylvania, Keating in Massachusetts and Sullivan Lafarge in New York state in 1994.[15] It acquired Allied Building Products, which specialized in roofing and cladding products and Tilcon, a major road construction specialist in the Northeast United States in 1996.[16]
2000-2010: Later acquisitions[edit]




CRH global production sites in 2010.


The company entered Switzerland in 2000 with the EUR 425 million purchase of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, as well as a regional distribution network.[17] In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav.[18] In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a market-leading do-it-yourself store chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands.[19] In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce [20]
In the United States, CRH also acquired Ohio's Shelly Group in 2000,[21] and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002[22] and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company's largest ever deal.[23] In 2007 CRH purchased four companies, worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc. (CYDI), Eugene Sand & Gravel, Cessford Construction and McMinn's Asphalt and Prospect Agrregates.[24] Also in 2008 CRH agreed to purchase a landscape paver, Pavestone, for $540 million.[25]
In 2006 CRH took a new turn and invested in a cement factory based in the Heilongjiang region in China.[26] It has built on that presence acquiring a 26% stake in the Jilin Yatai Group and an option to acquire 49% in the future.[27] In 2008 CRH agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Indian cement company My Home Industries Ltd. for €290 million ($452 million).[28]
2011-2017: Americas and emerging markets[edit]

CRH confirmed in 2013 that it was interested in looking at other opportunities in India.[29] n 2015, CRH remained listed in both London and Dublin.[30] In February 2015, CRH agreed to purchase the UK building materials producer Lafarge Tarmac.[31] In 2015, CRH purchased US $6.5 billion of assets from the newly formed company LafargeHolcim. The acquisition almost tripled CRH's net debt, bringing it to €6.6 billion.[32] The LafargeHolcim acquisition made CRH "the world’s third-largest building materials group by market value." A week after CEO Albert Manifold announced that CRH was looking for large-scale acquisitions, in August 2015, CRH paid $1.3 billion for CR Laurence, a glazing company based in California.[30] At the time, CRH already had a similar business in North America called BuildingEnvelope, with 4,500 employees, which it said it would integrate with CRL.[30] By November 2015, CRH was getting about a fifth of its operating earnings from US infrastructure.[33]
In June 2016, the Financial Times reported that CRH earned twice as much profit from the Americas versus Europe.[34] As of November 2016, half the asphalt, aggregates and assorted material it sold went to the United States.[32] Headquartered in Dublin, CRH was also the biggest producer of asphalt in the US, and the third largest producer of ready-mixed concrete.[35] Sales for 2016 were €27.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. Profit after tax was €1.3 billion.[8] In April 2017, the Irish Times noted that chief executive Albert Manifold’s package almost doubled in 2016 to €10 million, despite disagreement among shareholders the year before on pay.[36] As of April 27, 2017, CRH was Ireland's biggest company.[8][37] Chief executive was Albert Manifold. That quarter, sales were up in its three divisions in Europe, while the Americas materials unit had higher sales as well.[37] At the time, it did 65 percent of its business in the Americas, while the market in the Philippines proving to be "challenging," and weighing down performance in Asia.[38] On April 27, 2017, CRH held their annual general meeting in Dublin, at which point 17 percent of shareholders voted against the company's executive pay structure. The year prior, 40 percent had voted against. At the meeting, chairman Nick Hartery noted that share price in the company had increased 80 percent since 2014.[8] Also in April 2017, it was reported that CRH was expecting to make a large-scale acquisition in 2018. At the time, over the earlier part of the year CRH had spent €500 million on eight acquisitions.[39] In early May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in CRH plc.[40]

Controversy[edit]
Cartel accusations[edit]
Poland[edit]
In Poland in 2007, CRH was fined €530,000 by the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for interfering with evidence that Polish authorities were gathering for a price-fixing investigation.[46] In 2009, Grupa Ożarów (in which CRH first invested in 1995) was fined €26 million for operating a price fixing cartel in Poland.[47] The Polish Competition Regulator stated that seven companies, which accounted for almost 100 per cent of the market, had fixed minimum prices for grey cement, and agreed on a market share for each operator. CRH has stated its belief that Ozarów operated an independent commercial policy in Poland and the fine has been appealed.[48]
Ireland[edit]
In Ireland in 1994, Irish Cement Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRH, was determined by the European Commission to be part of price fixing and market sharing cartel across Europe which it said had illegally and artificially inflated the price of cement throughout the continent. A fine of over €3.5 million was levied.[49] Two years later, in Ireland also in 1996, High Court proceedings were initiated against CRH, its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused CRH and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anti-competitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business.[50] In 2012, CRH applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the "inordinate and inexcusable delay" in bringing forward any evidence in the case.[51] That judgement was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2012. At the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in CRH and was forced to stand down.[52] In 2011, a separate Irish High Court action was initiated against CRH by another company who claimed CRH operated a cartel and abused a position of dominance in order to evict it from the market.[citation needed] As of 2012, the Irish cement and concrete industry at large was under investigation by the Irish Competition Authority.[53]
United States[edit]
In 2006, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in California against Oldcastle Precast (CRH subsidiary) and three AT&T affiliates. The defendants were alleged to have unreasonably restrained trade and conspired to monopolize telephone vaults for land-line connections. Plaintiffs challenged a contract requiring developers to purchase Oldcastle Precast product for properties served by AT&T infrastructure. They also contended the arrangement led to Oldcastle Precast capturing northern California sales of precast electrical vaults, which were often placed concurrently with telephone structures. In 2010, an American Court of Appeal ruled that the Plaintiff’s counsel had failed to provide enough evidence to show that the defendants Oldcastle Precast Inc. and three AT&T affiliates harmed competition in California and Nevada telephone vault markets.[54]
In October 2009, a cement and concrete price fixing class action lawsuit was filed in Florida against Oldcastle Materials (CRH subsidiary) and others. The claim alleged that the defendants eliminated competition in the market for cement and concrete by charging artificially high prices from at least the period 2000 to 2009. The claim further alleged that the conspiracy was facilitated through in-personal meetings, telephone conversations and other communications. In 2008 the defendants announced uniform price increases for concrete and cement, bringing their prices to the same level at the same time, the lawsuit claimed. Then in September a number of defendant companies cut the price of concrete in an effort to lure customers away from independently owned concrete firms. The lawsuit stated that the practices alleged in the cement and concrete industry were clearly illegal.[55] In 2012, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.[56]
The largest cases in the USA seem to be in Florida 2009 to 2012 - price fixing / New Jersey for blowing up a mine in context of Federal Grant money potential frauds. However, the grandiose doings near Lake Deforest in New City / Dutchtown / Haverstraw and West Nyack, NY since about 2006 to 2017 are shocking but not surprising. One may obtain the latest Consent Order(s) by calling the new Region 3 Director, Kelly Turturro at 845-256-3033 and the DEC can put you in contact with Eric Kim of the DOW branch of the DEC for details about unpaid fines regarding testing/analysis that seems not to be viably done for many years (also in Consent Orders / last quarter 2015 DEC authored Haverstraw Quarry "Notice of Violation" dated Nov. 4, 2015 to some extent).
Allegations of corrupt payments to politicians[edit]
Poland[edit]
In 2005, a Polish businessman, Marek Dochnal, alleged to a Polish Parliamentary Inquiry that he had arranged a bribe of almost $1 million for CRH to a former minister for privatisation, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, in connection with the privatisation of a cement plant at Ozarow, in central Poland, in 1995.[57] CRH which now owns and operates the cement plant at Ozarow said the allegations were "without foundation".[58]
It was also revealed in 2005, that CRH contributed €125,000 to a charity founded by the wife of Poland’s President, Jolanta Kwasniewska. Both CRH and the Polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction.[59]
Ireland[edit]
In 2003, CRH was accused of making corrupt payments to Ireland’s former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles J. Haughey as details emerged of how Mr. Haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours. In 1969, Roadstone Ltd (CRH) sold 80 acres of land to Mr. Haughey, the then Minister of Finance, for £120,000. In 1973, Mr. Haughey sold 17.5 acres of that land back to CRH for £140,000. Within four years, Mr. Haughey had made a net profit of £20,000 and 62.5 acres at CRH’s expense.[60] Charles J. Haughey was also offered chairmanship of CRH in 1972.[61]
Illegal Ansbacher Bank[edit]
The existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in 1997 during the McCracken Tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry.[62]
It emerged this illegal bank was founded in the 1970s and was being run by Des Traynor who was chairman of CRH from 1989 to 1994 and who ran his bank during that period out of CRH’s registered office in Dublin's Fitzwilliam Square where the company provided an office for its chairman. Mr. Traynor was also personal financier to Charles Haughey.[63]
During the investigation it materialised that Justice Moriarty held approximately £500,000 in CRH shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning CRH he was not, he said, precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from Des Traynor's offices at Fitzwilliam Square[64] Sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing Moriarty given his shareholding[65]
In 1999, as evidence on the scale of the Ansbacher accounts grew Taniste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) and PD Minister Mary Harney asked the High Court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders.[66]
The High Court Inspectors' report was published in 2002[67] It found that eight out of fifteen CRH directors held Ansbacher accounts, including four former Chairmen.[68] It also concluded (Chapter 15, p. 189) that "CRH as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of Ansbacher’s activities in Ireland"[67]
After the publication of the report CRH acknowledged publicly that its then Chairman had "misused its facilities and personnel" which "represented a grave breach of trust by Mr. Traynor"[69]
Sale of Glen Ding Lands[edit]
In 1998, further questions were asked about CRH’s influence and political corruption when Dáil Éireann (Ireland’s Parliament) voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £48 million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to Roadstone, a subsidiary company of CRH, without public tender for £1.25 million in 1991.[70]
Many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale, Charles J. Haughey was Taoiseach and his financier Des Traynor was Chairman of CRH. Dáil Éireann however voted not to investigate whether CRH had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of Glen Ding. Subsequently, corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation.[71]
The State's Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell "far short of" the Roadstone offer and that "The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State" (Section 9.6). It did also note "even though it is unlikely that the Roadstone offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business" It was noted by the Department's Accounting Officer that the Roadstone offer "was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received", that another bidder "was afforded every opportunity" to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues "In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional".[72]
The Glen Ding transaction was further investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal which in 2006 reported its conclusion "that there was no connection, directly or indirectly, between Mr. Charles Haughey and any aspect of this disposal, nor any connection between the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal."[73]
Public criticism[edit]
In 2005, opposition TD (Teachta Dála - Irish member of parliament) Phil Hogan, who later became Minister for Environment (2011 - ), stated in Dáil Éireann that "there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………In the case of CRH, profits have been extracted from the Irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anti-competitive and anti-consumer. The European Court of First Instance and finally the European Court of Justice have upheld findings of serious anti-competitive behaviour against CRH and other. While Sweden, Finland, UK, France and Germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry, Ireland’s answer has been a stony silence."[74]
In 2011 TD Shane Ross, a repeated critic of CRH as a journalist stated that "CRH disturbs" him and questioned why there had been no investigation of CRH in Ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere.[75]

History[edit]
1970-1980s: Formation and listings[edit]
The company, whose name is an abbreviation of Cement Roadstone Holdings, was formed through the merger in 1970 of Cement Ltd (established in 1936) and Roadstone Ltd (established in 1949).[4] According to Jonathan Guthrie of the Financial Times, it is pronounced “Cee Orr Haitch.”[5] The company went public on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1973.[6]
CRH entered the United States in 1978 by buying Amcor, a concrete products group in Utah which would then form the basis of the company's U.S. division, which is now called Oldcastle Inc.. Subsequent large purchases in the US included Callanan Industries, a New York State based aggregates and asphalt producer in 1985.[7] In 1987, CRH was listed on London's FTSE 100 index.[8]
1990s: Early Europe and US acquisitions[edit]
In the 1990s the company moved into France with a number of buys including Raboni SA, a builders merchant company and drainage systems and concrete vault manufacturing group Prefaest SA.[9]
In 1995, CRH made its first entry into new or emerging markets when it bought Holding Cement Polski, which later gained majority control of Cementownia Ozarow, one of the Poland's major cement producers.[10] That acquisition also marked the first CRH cement manufacturing operation outside Ireland. By the end of the decade, CRH numbered more than a dozen operations in Poland and it has since invested in cement production in neighbouring Ukraine,[11] most recently with the announcement of an agreement to buy Mykolaiv Cement from rival Lafarge.[12] In 1999 CRH bought Finnsementti Oy, Finland's only cement producer, and Lohja Rudus Oy, Finland's country's top producer of aggregates and ready-mix concrete.[13]
In the 1990s, US acquisitions by CRH included Betco Block & Products Inc, of Bethesda, Maryland in 1990.[14] CRH acquired Balf Co. in Connecticut, Lebanon Rock in Pennsylvania, Keating in Massachusetts and Sullivan Lafarge in New York state in 1994.[15] It acquired Allied Building Products, which specialized in roofing and cladding products and Tilcon, a major road construction specialist in the Northeast United States in 1996.[16]
2000-2010: Later acquisitions[edit]




CRH global production sites in 2010.


The company entered Switzerland in 2000 with the EUR 425 million purchase of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, as well as a regional distribution network.[17] In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav.[18] In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a market-leading do-it-yourself store chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands.[19] In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce [20]
In the United States, CRH also acquired Ohio's Shelly Group in 2000,[21] and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002[22] and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company's largest ever deal.[23] In 2007 CRH purchased four companies, worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc. (CYDI), Eugene Sand & Gravel, Cessford Construction and McMinn's Asphalt and Prospect Agrregates.[24] Also in 2008 CRH agreed to purchase a landscape paver, Pavestone, for $540 million.[25]
In 2006 CRH took a new turn and invested in a cement factory based in the Heilongjiang region in China.[26] It has built on that presence acquiring a 26% stake in the Jilin Yatai Group and an option to acquire 49% in the future.[27] In 2008 CRH agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Indian cement company My Home Industries Ltd. for €290 million ($452 million).[28]
2011-2017: Americas and emerging markets[edit]

CRH confirmed in 2013 that it was interested in looking at other opportunities in India.[29] n 2015, CRH remained listed in both London and Dublin.[30] In February 2015, CRH agreed to purchase the UK building materials producer Lafarge Tarmac.[31] In 2015, CRH purchased US $6.5 billion of assets from the newly formed company LafargeHolcim. The acquisition almost tripled CRH's net debt, bringing it to €6.6 billion.[32] The LafargeHolcim acquisition made CRH "the world’s third-largest building materials group by market value." A week after CEO Albert Manifold announced that CRH was looking for large-scale acquisitions, in August 2015, CRH paid $1.3 billion for CR Laurence, a glazing company based in California.[30] At the time, CRH already had a similar business in North America called BuildingEnvelope, with 4,500 employees, which it said it would integrate with CRL.[30] By November 2015, CRH was getting about a fifth of its operating earnings from US infrastructure.[33]
In June 2016, the Financial Times reported that CRH earned twice as much profit from the Americas versus Europe.[34] As of November 2016, half the asphalt, aggregates and assorted material it sold went to the United States.[32] Headquartered in Dublin, CRH was also the biggest producer of asphalt in the US, and the third largest producer of ready-mixed concrete.[35] Sales for 2016 were €27.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. Profit after tax was €1.3 billion.[8] In April 2017, the Irish Times noted that chief executive Albert Manifold’s package almost doubled in 2016 to €10 million, despite disagreement among shareholders the year before on pay.[36] As of April 27, 2017, CRH was Ireland's biggest company.[8][37] Chief executive was Albert Manifold. That quarter, sales were up in its three divisions in Europe, while the Americas materials unit had higher sales as well.[37] At the time, it did 65 percent of its business in the Americas, while the market in the Philippines proving to be "challenging," and weighing down performance in Asia.[38] On April 27, 2017, CRH held their annual general meeting in Dublin, at which point 17 percent of shareholders voted against the company's executive pay structure. The year prior, 40 percent had voted against. At the meeting, chairman Nick Hartery noted that share price in the company had increased 80 percent since 2014.[8] Also in April 2017, it was reported that CRH was expecting to make a large-scale acquisition in 2018. At the time, over the earlier part of the year CRH had spent €500 million on eight acquisitions.[39] In early May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in CRH plc.[40]

Controversy[edit]
Cartel accusations[edit]
Poland[edit]
In Poland in 2007, CRH was fined €530,000 by the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for interfering with evidence that Polish authorities were gathering for a price-fixing investigation.[46] In 2009, Grupa Ożarów (in which CRH first invested in 1995) was fined €26 million for operating a price fixing cartel in Poland.[47] The Polish Competition Regulator stated that seven companies, which accounted for almost 100 per cent of the market, had fixed minimum prices for grey cement, and agreed on a market share for each operator. CRH has stated its belief that Ozarów operated an independent commercial policy in Poland and the fine has been appealed.[48]
Ireland[edit]
In Ireland in 1994, Irish Cement Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRH, was determined by the European Commission to be part of price fixing and market sharing cartel across Europe which it said had illegally and artificially inflated the price of cement throughout the continent. A fine of over €3.5 million was levied.[49] Two years later, in Ireland also in 1996, High Court proceedings were initiated against CRH, its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused CRH and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anti-competitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business.[50] In 2012, CRH applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the "inordinate and inexcusable delay" in bringing forward any evidence in the case.[51] That judgement was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2012. At the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in CRH and was forced to stand down.[52] In 2011, a separate Irish High Court action was initiated against CRH by another company who claimed CRH operated a cartel and abused a position of dominance in order to evict it from the market.[citation needed] As of 2012, the Irish cement and concrete industry at large was under investigation by the Irish Competition Authority.[53]
United States[edit]
In 2006, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in California against Oldcastle Precast (CRH subsidiary) and three AT&T affiliates. The defendants were alleged to have unreasonably restrained trade and conspired to monopolize telephone vaults for land-line connections. Plaintiffs challenged a contract requiring developers to purchase Oldcastle Precast product for properties served by AT&T infrastructure. They also contended the arrangement led to Oldcastle Precast capturing northern California sales of precast electrical vaults, which were often placed concurrently with telephone structures. In 2010, an American Court of Appeal ruled that the Plaintiff’s counsel had failed to provide enough evidence to show that the defendants Oldcastle Precast Inc. and three AT&T affiliates harmed competition in California and Nevada telephone vault markets.[54]
In October 2009, a cement and concrete price fixing class action lawsuit was filed in Florida against Oldcastle Materials (CRH subsidiary) and others. The claim alleged that the defendants eliminated competition in the market for cement and concrete by charging artificially high prices from at least the period 2000 to 2009. The claim further alleged that the conspiracy was facilitated through in-personal meetings, telephone conversations and other communications. In 2008 the defendants announced uniform price increases for concrete and cement, bringing their prices to the same level at the same time, the lawsuit claimed. Then in September a number of defendant companies cut the price of concrete in an effort to lure customers away from independently owned concrete firms. The lawsuit stated that the practices alleged in the cement and concrete industry were clearly illegal.[55] In 2012, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.[56]
The largest cases in the USA seem to be in Florida 2009 to 2012 - price fixing / New Jersey for blowing up a mine in context of Federal Grant money potential frauds. However, the grandiose doings near Lake Deforest in New City / Dutchtown / Haverstraw and West Nyack, NY since about 2006 to 2017 are shocking but not surprising. One may obtain the latest Consent Order(s) by calling the new Region 3 Director, Kelly Turturro at 845-256-3033 and the DEC can put you in contact with Eric Kim of the DOW branch of the DEC for details about unpaid fines regarding testing/analysis that seems not to be viably done for many years (also in Consent Orders / last quarter 2015 DEC authored Haverstraw Quarry "Notice of Violation" dated Nov. 4, 2015 to some extent).
Allegations of corrupt payments to politicians[edit]
Poland[edit]
In 2005, a Polish businessman, Marek Dochnal, alleged to a Polish Parliamentary Inquiry that he had arranged a bribe of almost $1 million for CRH to a former minister for privatisation, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, in connection with the privatisation of a cement plant at Ozarow, in central Poland, in 1995.[57] CRH which now owns and operates the cement plant at Ozarow said the allegations were "without foundation".[58]
It was also revealed in 2005, that CRH contributed €125,000 to a charity founded by the wife of Poland’s President, Jolanta Kwasniewska. Both CRH and the Polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction.[59]
Ireland[edit]
In 2003, CRH was accused of making corrupt payments to Ireland’s former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles J. Haughey as details emerged of how Mr. Haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours. In 1969, Roadstone Ltd (CRH) sold 80 acres of land to Mr. Haughey, the then Minister of Finance, for £120,000. In 1973, Mr. Haughey sold 17.5 acres of that land back to CRH for £140,000. Within four years, Mr. Haughey had made a net profit of £20,000 and 62.5 acres at CRH’s expense.[60] Charles J. Haughey was also offered chairmanship of CRH in 1972.[61]
Illegal Ansbacher Bank[edit]
The existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in 1997 during the McCracken Tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry.[62]
It emerged this illegal bank was founded in the 1970s and was being run by Des Traynor who was chairman of CRH from 1989 to 1994 and who ran his bank during that period out of CRH’s registered office in Dublin's Fitzwilliam Square where the company provided an office for its chairman. Mr. Traynor was also personal financier to Charles Haughey.[63]
During the investigation it materialised that Justice Moriarty held approximately £500,000 in CRH shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning CRH he was not, he said, precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from Des Traynor's offices at Fitzwilliam Square[64] Sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing Moriarty given his shareholding[65]
In 1999, as evidence on the scale of the Ansbacher accounts grew Taniste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) and PD Minister Mary Harney asked the High Court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders.[66]
The High Court Inspectors' report was published in 2002[67] It found that eight out of fifteen CRH directors held Ansbacher accounts, including four former Chairmen.[68] It also concluded (Chapter 15, p. 189) that "CRH as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of Ansbacher’s activities in Ireland"[67]
After the publication of the report CRH acknowledged publicly that its then Chairman had "misused its facilities and personnel" which "represented a grave breach of trust by Mr. Traynor"[69]
Sale of Glen Ding Lands[edit]
In 1998, further questions were asked about CRH’s influence and political corruption when Dáil Éireann (Ireland’s Parliament) voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £48 million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to Roadstone, a subsidiary company of CRH, without public tender for £1.25 million in 1991.[70]
Many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale, Charles J. Haughey was Taoiseach and his financier Des Traynor was Chairman of CRH. Dáil Éireann however voted not to investigate whether CRH had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of Glen Ding. Subsequently, corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation.[71]
The State's Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell "far short of" the Roadstone offer and that "The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State" (Section 9.6). It did also note "even though it is unlikely that the Roadstone offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business" It was noted by the Department's Accounting Officer that the Roadstone offer "was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received", that another bidder "was afforded every opportunity" to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues "In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional".[72]
The Glen Ding transaction was further investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal which in 2006 reported its conclusion "that there was no connection, directly or indirectly, between Mr. Charles Haughey and any aspect of this disposal, nor any connection between the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal."[73]
Public criticism[edit]
In 2005, opposition TD (Teachta Dála - Irish member of parliament) Phil Hogan, who later became Minister for Environment (2011 - ), stated in Dáil Éireann that "there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………In the case of CRH, profits have been extracted from the Irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anti-competitive and anti-consumer. The European Court of First Instance and finally the European Court of Justice have upheld findings of serious anti-competitive behaviour against CRH and other. While Sweden, Finland, UK, France and Germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry, Ireland’s answer has been a stony silence."[74]
In 2011 TD Shane Ross, a repeated critic of CRH as a journalist stated that "CRH disturbs" him and questioned why there had been no investigation of CRH in Ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere.[75]

History[edit]
1970-1980s: Formation and listings[edit]
The company, whose name is an abbreviation of Cement Roadstone Holdings, was formed through the merger in 1970 of Cement Ltd (established in 1936) and Roadstone Ltd (established in 1949).[4] According to Jonathan Guthrie of the Financial Times, it is pronounced “Cee Orr Haitch.”[5] The company went public on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1973.[6]
CRH entered the United States in 1978 by buying Amcor, a concrete products group in Utah which would then form the basis of the company's U.S. division, which is now called Oldcastle Inc.. Subsequent large purchases in the US included Callanan Industries, a New York State based aggregates and asphalt producer in 1985.[7] In 1987, CRH was listed on London's FTSE 100 index.[8]
1990s: Early Europe and US acquisitions[edit]
In the 1990s the company moved into France with a number of buys including Raboni SA, a builders merchant company and drainage systems and concrete vault manufacturing group Prefaest SA.[9]
In 1995, CRH made its first entry into new or emerging markets when it bought Holding Cement Polski, which later gained majority control of Cementownia Ozarow, one of the Poland's major cement producers.[10] That acquisition also marked the first CRH cement manufacturing operation outside Ireland. By the end of the decade, CRH numbered more than a dozen operations in Poland and it has since invested in cement production in neighbouring Ukraine,[11] most recently with the announcement of an agreement to buy Mykolaiv Cement from rival Lafarge.[12] In 1999 CRH bought Finnsementti Oy, Finland's only cement producer, and Lohja Rudus Oy, Finland's country's top producer of aggregates and ready-mix concrete.[13]
In the 1990s, US acquisitions by CRH included Betco Block & Products Inc, of Bethesda, Maryland in 1990.[14] CRH acquired Balf Co. in Connecticut, Lebanon Rock in Pennsylvania, Keating in Massachusetts and Sullivan Lafarge in New York state in 1994.[15] It acquired Allied Building Products, which specialized in roofing and cladding products and Tilcon, a major road construction specialist in the Northeast United States in 1996.[16]
2000-2010: Later acquisitions[edit]




CRH global production sites in 2010.


The company entered Switzerland in 2000 with the EUR 425 million purchase of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, as well as a regional distribution network.[17] In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav.[18] In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a market-leading do-it-yourself store chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands.[19] In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce [20]
In the United States, CRH also acquired Ohio's Shelly Group in 2000,[21] and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002[22] and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company's largest ever deal.[23] In 2007 CRH purchased four companies, worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc. (CYDI), Eugene Sand & Gravel, Cessford Construction and McMinn's Asphalt and Prospect Agrregates.[24] Also in 2008 CRH agreed to purchase a landscape paver, Pavestone, for $540 million.[25]
In 2006 CRH took a new turn and invested in a cement factory based in the Heilongjiang region in China.[26] It has built on that presence acquiring a 26% stake in the Jilin Yatai Group and an option to acquire 49% in the future.[27] In 2008 CRH agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Indian cement company My Home Industries Ltd. for €290 million ($452 million).[28]
2011-2017: Americas and emerging markets[edit]

CRH confirmed in 2013 that it was interested in looking at other opportunities in India.[29] n 2015, CRH remained listed in both London and Dublin.[30] In February 2015, CRH agreed to purchase the UK building materials producer Lafarge Tarmac.[31] In 2015, CRH purchased US $6.5 billion of assets from the newly formed company LafargeHolcim. The acquisition almost tripled CRH's net debt, bringing it to €6.6 billion.[32] The LafargeHolcim acquisition made CRH "the world’s third-largest building materials group by market value." A week after CEO Albert Manifold announced that CRH was looking for large-scale acquisitions, in August 2015, CRH paid $1.3 billion for CR Laurence, a glazing company based in California.[30] At the time, CRH already had a similar business in North America called BuildingEnvelope, with 4,500 employees, which it said it would integrate with CRL.[30] By November 2015, CRH was getting about a fifth of its operating earnings from US infrastructure.[33]
In June 2016, the Financial Times reported that CRH earned twice as much profit from the Americas versus Europe.[34] As of November 2016, half the asphalt, aggregates and assorted material it sold went to the United States.[32] Headquartered in Dublin, CRH was also the biggest producer of asphalt in the US, and the third largest producer of ready-mixed concrete.[35] Sales for 2016 were €27.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. Profit after tax was €1.3 billion.[8] In April 2017, the Irish Times noted that chief executive Albert Manifold’s package almost doubled in 2016 to €10 million, despite disagreement among shareholders the year before on pay.[36] As of April 27, 2017, CRH was Ireland's biggest company.[8][37] Chief executive was Albert Manifold. That quarter, sales were up in its three divisions in Europe, while the Americas materials unit had higher sales as well.[37] At the time, it did 65 percent of its business in the Americas, while the market in the Philippines proving to be "challenging," and weighing down performance in Asia.[38] On April 27, 2017, CRH held their annual general meeting in Dublin, at which point 17 percent of shareholders voted against the company's executive pay structure. The year prior, 40 percent had voted against. At the meeting, chairman Nick Hartery noted that share price in the company had increased 80 percent since 2014.[8] Also in April 2017, it was reported that CRH was expecting to make a large-scale acquisition in 2018. At the time, over the earlier part of the year CRH had spent €500 million on eight acquisitions.[39] In early May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in CRH plc.[40]

Controversy[edit]
Cartel accusations[edit]
Poland[edit]
In Poland in 2007, CRH was fined €530,000 by the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for interfering with evidence that Polish authorities were gathering for a price-fixing investigation.[46] In 2009, Grupa Ożarów (in which CRH first invested in 1995) was fined €26 million for operating a price fixing cartel in Poland.[47] The Polish Competition Regulator stated that seven companies, which accounted for almost 100 per cent of the market, had fixed minimum prices for grey cement, and agreed on a market share for each operator. CRH has stated its belief that Ozarów operated an independent commercial policy in Poland and the fine has been appealed.[48]
Ireland[edit]
In Ireland in 1994, Irish Cement Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRH, was determined by the European Commission to be part of price fixing and market sharing cartel across Europe which it said had illegally and artificially inflated the price of cement throughout the continent. A fine of over €3.5 million was levied.[49] Two years later, in Ireland also in 1996, High Court proceedings were initiated against CRH, its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused CRH and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anti-competitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business.[50] In 2012, CRH applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the "inordinate and inexcusable delay" in bringing forward any evidence in the case.[51] That judgement was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2012. At the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in CRH and was forced to stand down.[52] In 2011, a separate Irish High Court action was initiated against CRH by another company who claimed CRH operated a cartel and abused a position of dominance in order to evict it from the market.[citation needed] As of 2012, the Irish cement and concrete industry at large was under investigation by the Irish Competition Authority.[53]
United States[edit]
In 2006, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in California against Oldcastle Precast (CRH subsidiary) and three AT&T affiliates. The defendants were alleged to have unreasonably restrained trade and conspired to monopolize telephone vaults for land-line connections. Plaintiffs challenged a contract requiring developers to purchase Oldcastle Precast product for properties served by AT&T infrastructure. They also contended the arrangement led to Oldcastle Precast capturing northern California sales of precast electrical vaults, which were often placed concurrently with telephone structures. In 2010, an American Court of Appeal ruled that the Plaintiff’s counsel had failed to provide enough evidence to show that the defendants Oldcastle Precast Inc. and three AT&T affiliates harmed competition in California and Nevada telephone vault markets.[54]
In October 2009, a cement and concrete price fixing class action lawsuit was filed in Florida against Oldcastle Materials (CRH subsidiary) and others. The claim alleged that the defendants eliminated competition in the market for cement and concrete by charging artificially high prices from at least the period 2000 to 2009. The claim further alleged that the conspiracy was facilitated through in-personal meetings, telephone conversations and other communications. In 2008 the defendants announced uniform price increases for concrete and cement, bringing their prices to the same level at the same time, the lawsuit claimed. Then in September a number of defendant companies cut the price of concrete in an effort to lure customers away from independently owned concrete firms. The lawsuit stated that the practices alleged in the cement and concrete industry were clearly illegal.[55] In 2012, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.[56]
The largest cases in the USA seem to be in Florida 2009 to 2012 - price fixing / New Jersey for blowing up a mine in context of Federal Grant money potential frauds. However, the grandiose doings near Lake Deforest in New City / Dutchtown / Haverstraw and West Nyack, NY since about 2006 to 2017 are shocking but not surprising. One may obtain the latest Consent Order(s) by calling the new Region 3 Director, Kelly Turturro at 845-256-3033 and the DEC can put you in contact with Eric Kim of the DOW branch of the DEC for details about unpaid fines regarding testing/analysis that seems not to be viably done for many years (also in Consent Orders / last quarter 2015 DEC authored Haverstraw Quarry "Notice of Violation" dated Nov. 4, 2015 to some extent).
Allegations of corrupt payments to politicians[edit]
Poland[edit]
In 2005, a Polish businessman, Marek Dochnal, alleged to a Polish Parliamentary Inquiry that he had arranged a bribe of almost $1 million for CRH to a former minister for privatisation, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, in connection with the privatisation of a cement plant at Ozarow, in central Poland, in 1995.[57] CRH which now owns and operates the cement plant at Ozarow said the allegations were "without foundation".[58]
It was also revealed in 2005, that CRH contributed €125,000 to a charity founded by the wife of Poland’s President, Jolanta Kwasniewska. Both CRH and the Polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction.[59]
Ireland[edit]
In 2003, CRH was accused of making corrupt payments to Ireland’s former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles J. Haughey as details emerged of how Mr. Haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours. In 1969, Roadstone Ltd (CRH) sold 80 acres of land to Mr. Haughey, the then Minister of Finance, for £120,000. In 1973, Mr. Haughey sold 17.5 acres of that land back to CRH for £140,000. Within four years, Mr. Haughey had made a net profit of £20,000 and 62.5 acres at CRH’s expense.[60] Charles J. Haughey was also offered chairmanship of CRH in 1972.[61]
Illegal Ansbacher Bank[edit]
The existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in 1997 during the McCracken Tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry.[62]
It emerged this illegal bank was founded in the 1970s and was being run by Des Traynor who was chairman of CRH from 1989 to 1994 and who ran his bank during that period out of CRH’s registered office in Dublin's Fitzwilliam Square where the company provided an office for its chairman. Mr. Traynor was also personal financier to Charles Haughey.[63]
During the investigation it materialised that Justice Moriarty held approximately £500,000 in CRH shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning CRH he was not, he said, precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from Des Traynor's offices at Fitzwilliam Square[64] Sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing Moriarty given his shareholding[65]
In 1999, as evidence on the scale of the Ansbacher accounts grew Taniste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) and PD Minister Mary Harney asked the High Court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders.[66]
The High Court Inspectors' report was published in 2002[67] It found that eight out of fifteen CRH directors held Ansbacher accounts, including four former Chairmen.[68] It also concluded (Chapter 15, p. 189) that "CRH as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of Ansbacher’s activities in Ireland"[67]
After the publication of the report CRH acknowledged publicly that its then Chairman had "misused its facilities and personnel" which "represented a grave breach of trust by Mr. Traynor"[69]
Sale of Glen Ding Lands[edit]
In 1998, further questions were asked about CRH’s influence and political corruption when Dáil Éireann (Ireland’s Parliament) voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £48 million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to Roadstone, a subsidiary company of CRH, without public tender for £1.25 million in 1991.[70]
Many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale, Charles J. Haughey was Taoiseach and his financier Des Traynor was Chairman of CRH. Dáil Éireann however voted not to investigate whether CRH had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of Glen Ding. Subsequently, corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation.[71]
The State's Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell "far short of" the Roadstone offer and that "The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State" (Section 9.6). It did also note "even though it is unlikely that the Roadstone offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business" It was noted by the Department's Accounting Officer that the Roadstone offer "was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received", that another bidder "was afforded every opportunity" to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues "In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional".[72]
The Glen Ding transaction was further investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal which in 2006 reported its conclusion "that there was no connection, directly or indirectly, between Mr. Charles Haughey and any aspect of this disposal, nor any connection between the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal."[73]
Public criticism[edit]
In 2005, opposition TD (Teachta Dála - Irish member of parliament) Phil Hogan, who later became Minister for Environment (2011 - ), stated in Dáil Éireann that "there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………In the case of CRH, profits have been extracted from the Irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anti-competitive and anti-consumer. The European Court of First Instance and finally the European Court of Justice have upheld findings of serious anti-competitive behaviour against CRH and other. While Sweden, Finland, UK, France and Germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry, Ireland’s answer has been a stony silence."[74]
In 2011 TD Shane Ross, a repeated critic of CRH as a journalist stated that "CRH disturbs" him and questioned why there had been no investigation of CRH in Ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere.[75]

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services. A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.

These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.
Persons outside of the United States should visit Fidelity Institutional, which will direct them to the appropriate overseas web site of Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates.

Limited, Fidelity Investments Japan, and Fidelity Brokerage Services Japan LLC offer products and services designed specifically for overseas investors.
 
 Broker-dealer's potential conflicts 
As a broker-dealer, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC or its affiliates may act as principal for its own account or as agent for its customers in connection with the sale to you or purchase by you of a security that is the subject of content prepared by Fidelity. If it receives a mark-up or commission or acts as agent for another person in connection with any such transaction, Fidelity may have a potential conflict of interest. You understand this potential conflict and acknowledge that you may choose to effect securities transactions at another broker-dealer.
 
 Limitations on investment guidance and professional advice 
The Fidelity Sites are not intended to provide legal, tax, investment or insurance advice. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Fidelity or any third party. Certain investment planning tools available on the Fidelity Sites may provide general investment education based on your input. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

EUROPE�MATERIALS: EURO 27 MILLION


The Europe Materials Division completed 4 acquisitions, adding
  incremental annual sales of euro 18 million and significant aggregates reserves, at a total
  cost of euro 27 million.


Britain
C4-Industries, an access-chamber manufacturer based
  in�Liverpool, was acquired in January. With annual sales of euro 5 million, C4's major
  markets include telecoms, motorway communications and traffic signalling and the
  acquisition extends the presence of Northstone's growing Irish utilities business in these
  markets.


Poland
In January, the Division acquired Osielec, a sandstone
  aggregates producer located 70 kilometres south of�Krakow. With annual sales of euro 5
  million, Osielec complements CRH's existing crushed rock business in the southwest of the
  country and secures substantial deposits of aggregates in a fast-growing market.
  �
�
Spain
In March, our aggregates and readymixed concrete business
  in�Spain�was strengthened through the acquisition of Moron Quarry. Located
  near�Seville, the acquisition secures good quality aggregates reserves
  in�Andalusia�providing in-house supply to our downstream concrete operations in
  the region.


Turkey
In January, Basaran, a readymixed concrete and aggregates
  business located in�Antalya, southern�Turkey�was acquired by our 50% Denizli
  joint venture. With a high quality quarry, two readymixed concrete locations and annualised
  sales of euro 8 million, the acquisition furthers Denizli's strategy of developing its
  downstream operations in�Turkey.


EUROPE�PRODUCTS: EURO 89 MILLION


Europe Products completed 8 acquisitions at a total cost of
  euro 89 million in the first half of the year. The annual incremental sales arising from
  these transactions amount to euro 152 million.


Concrete Products
The Concrete Products group completed three structural
  products acquisitions during the first half of 2008 in�Hungary,�Ireland�and
  the�Netherlands.
The acquisition of Ferrobeton in April saw CRH
  enter�Hungary�for the first time. With annualised sales of euro 80 million,
  Ferrobeton is a leading precast concrete elements producer operating four facilities
  in�Hungary�and one in�Slovakia, manufacturing a product range similar to
  that of our Romanian business. The acquisition expands and strengthens our Concrete
  Products business in eastern Europe and serves as a platform for future growth in the
  region. �
Concrete Stairs Systems, a prefabricated stairs manufacturer
  located in�Wexford,�Ireland�was acquired in January. The acquisition
  complements the Group's structural precast business in�Ireland�and has annual
  sales of euro 1 million.��Jonker Beton, an Amsterdam-based pavers and tiles
  manufacturer with annual sales of euro 20 million, was also acquired in April. Together
  with synergies stemming from more efficient allocation of production across CRH's expanded
  network, the acquisition strengthens our commercial position in�Amsterdam, one of
  the�Netherlands' most important public landscaping markets.��


Building Products
A total of five acquisitions were completed during the period.
  �


Building Envelope: The acquisition of Hela, a Belgian
  manufacturer and distributor of temporary fencing was completed in January. Hela, with
  annual sales of euro 4 million, strengthens CRH's manufacturing position and provides an
  opportunity to realise savings through switching from outsourced to in-house production of
  temporary fencing. SWS, acquired in March, is a leading assembler of roller shutters and
  roller doors in the�UK�market with annual sales of euro 17 million.
  �Operating from a single site in Lancashire and with excellent distribution channels
  across the�UK, SWS represents a further step in the expansion of the Roller, Shutters
  & Awnings (RSA) business.


Construction Accessories: In January, we acquired the Goldway
  Beijing and Sinasia group of companies, distributors in China of CRH's Halfen range of
  products. This business, with annual sales of euro 4 million, provides a local presence
  in�China�and offers an excellent opportunity to supply projects in the region
  with the Group's full range of high value-added technical products. Hammerl, a manufacturer
  of plastic construction accessories, construction foils and spacers, was acquired in
  February. Located in southern�Germany�and with annual sales of euro 25 million,
  Hammerl represents a strategic entry into the plastic construction foils market and is an
  excellent bolt-on to our German spacers business. Distanssystem, a Swedish manufacturer and
  distributor of plastic spacers with annual sales of euro 1 million, was acquired in June,
  consolidating the Group's leading position in plastic spacers in�Sweden.
  �


EUROPE�DISTRIBUTION: EURO 108 MILLION


Europe Distribution completed four transactions during the
  first half of 2008, two in each of Switzerland and the Netherlands, adding a total of 18
  builders merchants branches to its existing network with annual incremental sales of euro

CRH's Swiss merchanting operations were strengthened in May
  with the acquisition of the Reco-Regusci group which operates four general builders
  merchants and five sanitary ware products locations in Ticino, the Italian-speaking area of
  Switzerland. Reco-Regusci has annual sales of euro 24 million and is an excellent addition
  to the Group's distribution activities in�Switzerland, bringing coverage to nationwide
  levels. Sturm, a plumbing and reinforcement steel distribution business located in the east
  of�Switzerland, was acquired in June. Operating out of three locations and with annual
  sales of euro 50 million, Sturm complements and strengthens the Group's existing
  western-based sanitary ware and plumbing business, making it the only country-wide supplier
  of sanitary ware and plumbing products in�Switzerland.�


Imabo Nieuwegein, a Dutch builders merchant with five branches
  located in and around Nieuwegein, in the central�Netherlands, was acquired in May.
  With annual sales of euro 78 million, Imabo represents a good geographical fit with CRH's
  existing branch network. Hagens Bouwmaterialen, a single-branch builders merchant
  in�Zeist�with annual sales of euro 7 million, was also acquired in May.
  �


AMERICAS�MATERIALS: EURO 67 MILLION �


The Americas Materials Division continued its development
  programme through the completion of 13 acquisitions at a combined cost of US$ 102 million
  (euro 67 million) yielding annual incremental sales of US$ 123 million.


New York/New�Jersey
The aggregates and readymixed concrete business of Kroboth
  Companies headquartered in�Dalton,�Massachusetts�was acquired in January.
  With annualised sales of US$10 million, the acquisition secures scarce sand and gravel
  reserves and extends eastwards the market reach of the core Albany-based operations. New
  Windsor Equipment Rentals & Service, based in New Windsor, New York, is a single
  asphalt plant operator generating annual sales of US$ 5 million. Acquired in June, the
  acquisition will generate greater operating efficiencies within our local business
  network.


Central
In January, two small bolt-on acquisitions were completed
  adding annual incremental sales of US$ 11 million. Floyd Asphalt Paving is a small asphalt
  producer and paver located in southwest�Virginia�and is an excellent fit with our
  local business. The acquisition of HP Streicher, a Toledo, Ohio-based asphalt producer,
  enables the Division to maximise production and delivery synergies with the existing
  asphalt operations in�Toledo. �


The Appalachian Materials Group (AMG) within the Central
  division completed a series of bolt-ons during the period providing further scale and good
  operating synergies. February saw the acquisition of Renfro Construction Company, an
  asphalt paving contractor based in�Knoxville,�Tennessee�with annualised
  sales of US$ 44 million. Also in�Tennessee, Highland Sand, consisting of one sand
  quarry with 15 million tons of reserves located west of�Knoxville, was acquired in
  April; annualised sales amount to US$ 2 million. Western Materials, located in�North
  Carolina, was acquired in June. Generating annual sales of US$ 3 million, Western Materials
  consists of two granite quarries and will integrate seamlessly with the group's existing
  operations in the region.


West
Valco, an aggregates and readymixed concrete business with
  operations in mid-central�Colorado, was acquired in January. Valco has annual sales of
  US$ 4 million and provides a strong reserve position in a highly attractive growth market.
  The aggregates operations of Mallard Sand & Gravel, located in Valley,�Nebraska,
  were also acquired in January. With long-term aggregates reserves and a solid market
  position Mallard has annualised sales of US$ 6 million.


In March, the acquisition of Dixie Redi-Mix, a readymixed
  concrete business operating in�St. George,�Utah�was concluded. Dixie, with
  annual sales of US$ 4 million, is an excellent fit with our
  southern�Utah�businesses and expands our aggregates and asphalt business in the
  region. April saw the acquisition in northern Utah of Holdaway Pit, a 500-acre property
  with an estimated 120 million tons of high-quality, permitted aggregates reserves that
  further develops our aggregates position in that area. In May, the West division acquired
  American Paving, an integrated aggregates, asphalt and construction company based
  in�Meridian,�Idaho. American Paving adds incremental annual sales of US$ 31
  million and brings further exposure to the attractive�Idaho�market as well as
  securing long-term aggregates reserves for our existing�Idaho�business.
  �


A further bolt-on was completed in June. Bedrock Ready Mix,
  located in�Denison,�Iowa�is a small readymixed concrete company extending
  our coverage in the western�Iowa�market; annual sales are US$ 3
  million.


AMERICAS�PRODUCTS : EURO 32 MILLION


Three acquisitions and one joint-venture buy-out were
  completed in the first half of 2008 at a combined cost of US$ 50 million (euro 32 million)
  yielding annual incremental sales of US$ 36 million. �


Precast Group
Southern Drainage Products and Supply, a long established
  manufacturer of concrete pipe located in south Georgia, was acquired in April. With annual
  sales of US$ 11 million, the acquisition is an excellent fit with Precast's operations in
  the Southeast and fits well with its strategy of concentrating on products that are
  marketed to utilities, contractors and used in underground applications.�


Architectural Products Group (APG)
In February, APG acquired the remaining interest in Landmark
  Stone, a concrete veneer manufacturer located in�Kentucky. APG acquired its initial
  interest as part of the Matt Stone acquisition of 2003. The assets of Tri-Delta, consisting
  of a single block plant in�north Las Vegas,�Nevada�were acquired in April.
  Tri-Delta is a manufacturer and reseller of fence and architectural block, dry-mix and
  masonry related items. Combined incremental annual sales from these two transactions amount
  to US$ 11 million.


MMI�
MMI's Ivy Steel & Wire business position was strengthened
  with the acquisition in April of the assets of Pilot Steel located in�Pompano
  Beach,�Florida. Pilot Steel provides reinforcing steel ('rebar') largely to
  residential and commercial construction contractors and has annual sales of US$ 14 million.
  The acquisition expands Ivy's traditional product line of welded wire fabric products to
  include rebar and will heighten the profile of its heritage product line.�


AMERICAS�DISTRIBUTION: EURO 18 MILLION


Two acquisitions were completed in the first half of 2008 at a
  combined cost of US$ 27 million equivalent (euro 18 million) yielding annual incremental
  sales of US$ 49 million. �

  is a three-branch distributor focused on siding, windows and roofing in
  metro�Chicago�and�Milwaukee. With annual sales of US$ 32 million, Tri-State
  builds on Allied's existing presence in those cities as well as offering purchasing and
  overhead synergy opportunities.

  specialised building products based in�Santiago,�Chile�was acquired in
  February. Operating from three retail outlets, major product lines include ceramic tiles,
  sanitary ware, faucets and bath and kitchen accessories. The acquisition, which has

Consensus Ratings for Crh Plc (NYSE:CRH) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 3 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.29)Consensus Price Target: N/A
