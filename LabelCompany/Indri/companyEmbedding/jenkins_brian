Find a Nationwide Insurance Agent in Clayton, North Carolina
Nationwide auto insurance In Clayton, some people drive fuel—efficient vehicles to manage gas prices and navigate their daily commute, while others drive trucks and SUVs for the hauling capacity and ability to lend their friends and neighbors a helping hand. Some drive tens of thousands of miles annually. Some barely drive a couple thousand miles each year. Regardless of your driving habits and vehicle of choice, our Clayton auto insurance agents can help you find the right policy for your budget and coverage priorities.  Nationwide homeowners insurance In a city like Clayton with its quiet streets and safe neighborhoods, many homeowners take great pride in the life they’ve carved out for themselves. Still, no matter how sturdy the home construction, no matter how remote the cul de sac, there’s no such thing as 100% security. Whether you live on a busy street or in one of the surrounding enclaves, your home dwelling and belongings are susceptible to a number of hazards that are covered by Nationwide home insurance in Clayton. Many homeowners also seek out liability coverage for the harm that can befall mischievous neighborhood children. Nationwide life insurance Even in a small city like Clayton, there is a lot of life to live. The desire to protect your loved ones from the financial fallout of unexpected tragedy is about as universal as it gets. On the other hand, universal life insurance coverage isn’t a universal solution. Talk to one of our Clayton life insurance agents about the right type of policy for your household priorities, as well as additional policy options like long—term care coverage. Nationwide business insurance Even outside of the state’s major metropolitan areas, there are many consumer businesses and skilled professionals who operate successful companies. And Clayton is no exception. For brick—and—mortar shops, for online service and software companies, for small and medium—sized businesses, our local insurance agents can serve as your risk management advisors. They can also help find the right commercial insurance products to protect your business.  Personalized Quotes and Local Insurance Coverage Take advantage of our online tool to explore your policy options and costs. It only takes a few moments to enter your zip and answer a few basic questions. You can then buy a policy immediately or discuss things further with a local agent.

January 6th, 1998 In 2001, Mason Jenkins was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.His trials and appeals lasted 9 years and throughout that time, he held tight to his claim of innocence. Right after his murder, through the interegation his alibi was the story of 4 kidnappers.  The plan was for him to kill his parents. He planed that his parents would come home at different times.His plans were ruined because the parents came home together.Key Players.......Mason Jenkins is 20 years old. He resided in Chatham-Kent with his mother, father, and younger sister Jennifer, prior to being imprisioned for taking his sisters life. Mason had been in and out of trouble with the law since he was 12 years old, and was released from jail on December 27, 1997 for minor theft charges.Mason is the initial suspect for the murder of Jennifer Jenkins.Daughter to Brian and Leslie Jenkins Sister to Mason JenkinsJennifer is the victim of the crimeShot three times in the right temple and twice in the chest, close to the heartOver the course of the crime, from beginning to appeal to sentencing, Brian’s health slowly declines  Brian loses over 100 pounds and develops diabetes.Leslie is the one to discover Jennifer’s body and place the 911 callHe's the first police officer on the scene and involved in the case of Mason Jenkins.Cathy Belanger is seen on multiple occasions talking to Mason, and serves as somewhat of a confidant for him as she investigates Both express a lot of emotion in regards to their deceased niece and offer support and comfort to Brian and LesliePaul Bailey and Clay Powell: Crown Mike McArthur: Has control over Mason’s defenceJohn Kastner works closely with the family to create the documentary that follows the events of the ten-year murder storyJohn appears to maintain some type of bond with Mason, and in one interview states that he is “off to see his bad boy”.Story involved kidnappersSaid to the officer, "I have no reason to blow her head off'' The reaction of the parents after Mason admitted that he had committed the murderParents told the police not to touch anything or clean anything because it's their house and their daughterBeside the will was a note of Mason being kidnappedThe body was also moved from the couch to the basementThe one shot rifle was never brought to evidenceMason even says so himself that there is still more to the story to comeMason now has to live with the guilt of killing his sisterHe mentions in the video multiple times that Jennifer had a bright future ahead of her, and was going places and asks himself why couldn’t it have been him who died instead of herHe mentions in how once his parents die he will have no family left http://www.nfb.ca/film/life_with_murder/clip/life_with_murder_clip_3/The parents tried hard to keep their family functioning and as close knit as they could but the family was never the same after the murder• Brian, the father of Mason, experienced a great deal of health issues after the murder. He became very ill with diabetes and lost over 100 pounds. Within the film you can see the significant physical changes he goes through in a matter of a couple years• There was a negative focus brought upon Chatham through the publicity that the murder causedThe two sisters of Brian are protected by the last name of their husband and no one in the community really associates them as part of the Jenkins family because they hide the fact that their maiden name was Jenkins• The community for sure shunned the parents of Mason. In the film it talks about a time when the parents were in a grocery store, and people they knew would turn the opposite direction to avoid themMasons parents told him that they were open to any questions he had John let us know how no one in the family ever talked about the murder to each otherThey had never talked to Mason about the murder. They had never talked to their closest relatives about the murder. There was just this silence consensus in the family It took nine months to get the Chatham-Kent police to release the police videos. They were extremely concerned about the effect it would have on the Jenkins, who had to sign numerous releases.The police could not believe that the Jenkins would watch these things without going to piecesSome information about the Jenkins John Kastner provided us with:The videos completely changed the filmThe video of Aunt TraceyJohn discusses Brian and Leslie’s reaction to the filmJohn speaks about how there were long discussions about how they were going to show Leslie and Brain Jenkins the filmHe was scared that they wouldn’t like it and that they would have it endedFortunately, they were really pleased by it when they finally watched the final productBrian said it was hard for him to watch, but was glad he didLeslie was relieved and told John that it shows he’s been putting in lots of workImplications prior to child and youth worker in practice Red Flags prior to the murder (stealing cars) CYW could have helped him while going in and out of jail and family tooParent Counseling could have been offered to the family to help with daughter's deathFull transcriptMore presentations by
