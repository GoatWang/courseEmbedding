Centerbridge Partner LP Challenges Hercules Offshore Over The Second 'Unnecessary' Bankruptcy - Hercules Offshore Inc (NASDAQ:HERO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Centerbridge Partner LP Challenges Hercules Offshore Over The Second 'Unnecessary' BankruptcyJun. 8.16 | About: Hercules Offshore (HERO) Fun Trading Special situations, contrarian, long/short equity, valueSummaryHercules Offshore faces strong opposition from big shareholder Centerbridge Partners to its plan to shut down and sell off its assets.Centerbridge is urging that the confirmation hearing be pushed off.HERO is an Interesting case, but I recommend to stay away from any investing or trading right now, unless you like to gamble.

 This article is an update of my earlier article on Hercules Offshore(NASDAQ:HERO) from May 29, 2016. On June 7, 2016, The Wall Street Journal published an article written by M. Peg Wrikley:  Liquidating oil-drilling fleet operator Hercules Offshore Inc. faces strong opposition from big shareholder Centerbridge Partners LP to its plan to shut down and sell off its assets.  Hercules returned to bankruptcy Sunday, less than six months after a balance-sheet reshaping that was supposed to get it in shape for tough times in the oil industry. Centerbridge contends the balance-sheet reshaping worked but claims senior lenders maneuvered the company back into chapter 11 for improper purposes.  Hercules lawyer Philip Dublin said the argument is "not correct" but will play out in the coming months in a Delaware bankruptcy court.  Just a quick reminder of the proposed bankruptcy: On Friday, May 27, 2016, The company announced the following:  The Company has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement ("RSA") with lenders holding approximately 99 percent of the indebtedness under its first lien credit agreement. The agreement seeks to maximize value for the Company's stakeholders and provide a smooth transition for employees, customers and suppliers through an orderly sale of the Company's assets. Under the terms of the RSA, Hercules and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries will solicit acceptances and rejections of its pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan from first lien lenders and shareholders, file voluntary Chapter 11 petitions to compromise the Company's obligations to its first lien lenders and provide a recovery to its shareholders, and then place all of the Company's unsold assets into a wind-down vehicle to ensure their continued, safe operation until they can be sold. The Company's international subsidiaries will not be included as part of the Chapter 11 cases but will be part of the sale process. 
 What is the amount really owed to the "lenders"? It is now important to read the 8-K filing and stay away from any interpretation from the press release, which is quite misleading, in my opinion. The 8-K filing is saying the following: Pursuant to the A&R Forbearance Agreement, the Borrower received written notice from the Agent that the commitments under the First Lien Credit Agreement are terminated and the outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement are declared due and payable, in whole, including, without limitation the principal of the loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest thereon, unpaid accrued fees, the Applicable Premium (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) and all other obligations of the Borrower accrued under the First Lien Credit Agreement and any other Loan Document (as defined under the First Lien Credit Agreement). What does it mean? Assuming that the "Plan" will be approved and PRIOR to the distribution. Hercules Offshore owes, at least, $510 million plus unpaid and accrued interest to the first lien lenders (from the $579 million.) Here is an excerpt of the credit agreement in the 8-K page 3 "Term sheet." As of the RSA Effective Date, the aggregate amount of First Lien Claims is $579 million (plus accrued and unpaid interest), prior to taking into account any prepayments thereon contemplated by the Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement. However, if the plan is approved: If the class of holders of HERO Common Stock votes to accept the Plan, the First Lien Lenders shall receive their pro rata share of (NYSE:I) a non-interest bearing senior claim against the Wind Down Entity in the amount of USD $510 million, less the Escrow Release Payment (as defined in the Term Sheet) and any amounts previously distributed to the First Lien Lenders during the chapter 11 cases and (ii) 100% of Class A interests in the Wind Down Entity, which shall represent 85% of the Acceptance Wind Down Entity Interests (as defined in the Term Sheet).
 The distribution will be 85%/15% to the shareholders. The WSJ article said:  Tuesday, as Hercules pushed crucial early motions through court, Centerbridge lawyer Andrew Glenn accused senior lenders of manufacturing an unnecessary bankruptcy to collect a premium for early payoff of their debt.  "Why are we here today, given that the company has well over $400 million in cash… And oil has rebounded?" Mr. Glenn asked.  Centerbridge Partners, L.P. is a private investment firm with offices in New York and London. The firm focuses on private equity & credit investments. Centerbridge Partners owns 2,603,943 shares of HERO as of 3/31/2016 per Hercules offshore website. The lawyer for Centerbridge Partners, M. Andrew Glenn, accused the senior lenders to have created a situation to collect an applicable premium - roughly $129 million -- Which I think is an issue that can be potentially debated, if the right argument is used and if the issue of the initial "default" is questioned. However, what I do not understand is that M. Andrew Glenn, indicated that this situation is "unnecessary" due, in part, because the oil has rebounded, which is certainly the wrong argument, in my opinion. This explanation lacks of "offshore drilling knowledge," unfortunately. Yes, it is true that oil has experienced a strong positive momentum, and now trades above $50 per barrel. I would say so what! Nevertheless, it is NOT true that the offshore drillers have enjoyed any positive effects from this oil rally, and, in fact, the basic market situation is getting much worse since early March. The offshore drilling industry, shallow and deep water as well, has not improved and the tendering activity has totally vanished, beside some rare contract extensions negotiated at a dismal day rate. It is a fact that no one can refute. On the other side, M. Dublin, lawyer for Hercules offshore, talked about "unsuccessful sale process" to explain why HERO needs to return to chapter 11. I would argue that the company has been extremely slow and notoriously inefficient in this "sale process". Shareholders would like to see what has been done in this domain, since emerging from the first bankruptcy? Can we use "procrastination"?
 The second argument about the potential "cash burn rate" is more convincing and quite appealing. I estimated a cash burn rate of approximately $40 million per quarter, which is pretty close to the amount advanced by M. Dublin ($100 million at the end of 2016.) Nevertheless, M. Andrew Glenn, said that shareholders were expecting this loss of cash in 2016, and "were holding on for a return to profitability in 2017." To support this thinking he said, Recent forecasts put out by the company, show Hercules will be back in the black next year. However, shareholders that will be pushed out if the company's new bankruptcy scenario plays out won't be around to enjoy those profits, and neither will Hercules... Hercules plans to shut down its business and sell off assets in chapter 11, with some of the proceeds going to shareholders if they support its plan. And concluded that Hercules Offshore doesn't belong to a bankruptcy court and estimated that, The lenders are orchestrating the liquidation of this company, Mr. Glenn said, noting that Hercules is in chapter 11 not because of unrelenting gloom in the oil industry but because lenders want to cash in, even if it kills the company. I have to agree with Centerbridge Partners on this subject, and said that the lenders were not confident enough to let Hercules Offshore getting its hands on the $200 million in escrow for the Hercules Highlander, thereby, used the first pretext to claim a breach.  Federal bankruptcy watchdogs are weighing the appointment of an official committee of equity stakeholders in Hercules's chapter 11 case. Centerbridge is urging that a shareholder panel be named. Hercules said a shareholder committee could cause delay that risks plunging the company into a "free-fall" bankruptcy. In a free-fall, Hercules would be forced into fast sales of its assets rather than the controlled sales that the company thinks will bring the best value. The judge, however, seemed inclined to let shareholders weigh in on the question of Hercules's future. "I am concerned that the interests of equity be fully represented," Judge Kevin Carey said at Tuesday's hearing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. He rejected urging from Hercules to set a July 14 date to confirm its chapter 11 plan, which is being circulated for shareholder votes. 
 Now, Centerbridge is urging that the confirmation hearing be pushed off "to give an equity committee time to investigate and take a stand on Hercules's future." M. Dublin, HERO's lawyer, said the following: Efforts to find a buyer that would take over the operating company drew only non cash bids in amounts insufficient to cover the debt, he added. As we know, Hercules Offshore handed the Hercules Highlander over to a subsidiary of Maersk Drilling, getting out from under an obligation to pay $196 million to complete the rig. Lenders reclaimed the $200 million escrowed funds. On a final note, M. Glenn said that the "sale" of the Hercules Highlander will be a major focus. This part is quite strange, because I do not think HERO has anything to do with the rig and has nothing to sale? It would be really important that the company takes the time to explain in detail the status of the Hercules Highlander, and if the company can claim any cash, which I doubt. Conclusion: I do not see this situation as a positive event for common shareholders. If Centerbridge is successful in his attempt, Hercules offshore will be forced to sell assets quickly, and at an extremely distressed level that may or may not cover the debt and leave shareholders with a perfect zero. On the other hand, this second bankruptcy will allow time to sell the assets at higher price and eventually gives a potential cash distribution for the common shareholders. I do not think it will be high but it will be better than zero, at least. Again, as I said in my preceding article, do not count your chickens before they hatched. I recommend to stay away for HERO now because it is too risky.

CCPDA and CCPSDA hold warrants to purchase additional shares of Common Shares.  
However, the exercise of such warrants is subject to certain conditions,        
including conditions related to the price of the Common Shares, and such        
warrants are not currently exercisable.

This Amendment No. 6 (“Amendment No.
6”) amends and supplements the statement on Schedule 13D (the “Original Schedule 13D”) filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 21, 2014, as amended by Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment

on September 17, 2015, Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment No.3”) filed with the SEC on May 11, 2016, Amendment No.4
(“Amendment No. 4”) filed with the SEC on June 10, 2016, and Amendment No. 5 (“Amendment No. 5”)
filed with the SEC on July 1, 2016 (the Original Schedule 13D as amended by Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, Amendment No. 3,
Amendment No. 4, Amendment No. 5, and this Amendment No. 6, the “Schedule 13D”), with respect to the shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), of Genco Shipping & Trading Limited, a corporation
organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (the “Issuer”). This Amendment No. 5 amends
Items 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 as set forth below.
 


Item 3.
SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

 
 

 
Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by the addition of the following:

 
 

 
The Reporting Persons acquired the 6,597,938 shares of Series A Preferred Stock reported in this Schedule 13D pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (as defined in Item 4), which convert into 6,597,938 shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $31,999,999.30, which were derived from the working capital of CCP, CCPM, CSCP II, CSCP Cayman, CCP II Cayman and CCP SBS II Cayman.

 


Item 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

 
 

 
Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by the addition of the following:

 
 

 
As
    described in the Issuer’s Form 8-K filed October 6, 2016 (the “Form 8-K”), on October 6, 2016,
    certain funds managed by and affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (collectively, “Centerbridge”)
    entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the Issuer effective as of October 4, 2016 (the “Stock Purchase
    Agreement”) for the purchase of 6,597,938 shares of the Series A Preferred
    Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $31,999,999.30.  In addition, Centerbridge has agreed to provide a
    backstop commitment to purchase up to 3,402,062 additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $4.85 per share at a pro
    rata amount equal to the basic subscription amount for each fund.

 
 

 
The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $4.85 per share and will mandatorily convert into Common Stock at a conversion price of $4.85 per share, subject to certain adjustments, upon receipt of approval of the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock by the Company’s shareholders.  Commencing on the 180th day after issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 6% per share on the liquidation preference unless any such dividends are not permitted by law or the terms of any loan agreement, credit agreement, guaranty, or related agreement.  In such a case, the dividends will be deferred until conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.  Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, its holders will be entitled to receive the amount of any unpaid deferred dividends in cash or shares of Common Stock based on the conversion price then in effect.

 

 
CUSIP No. Y2685T115SCHEDULE 13D/APage 19 of 24 Pages 

 
 


 
As described in the Form 8-K, other stakeholders of the Issuer separately have entered into commitment letters with the Issuer in connection with the proposed Offering that, in each case, are substantially similar to the Stock Purchase Agreement.  The Reporting Persons hereby expressly disclaim membership in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with any other stakeholders in the Issuer, and the entry into the Stock Purchase Agreement and the filing of this Schedule 13D shall not be construed as an admission that any Reporting Person, for any purpose, is a member of a group with any such stakeholder, or any other person, or that the Reporting Persons beneficially own any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by any other stakeholder, or any other person.

 
 

 
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreements is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including, without limitation, refinancing and amendment of certain of the Issuer’s credit facilities.  Centerbridge has agreed in the Stock Purchase Agreement that it will vote all of its shares of common stock in favor of approval of conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Centerbridge and the Issuer intend to enter into an industry standard registration rights agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in that certain Registration Rights Agreement by and among the Company and certain of its shareholders dated as of July 9, 2014. In addition, the relative rights, preferences, limitations and designations of the Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation attached as Exhibit A to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 
 

 
The description of the Stock Purchase Agreement, including that of the Certificate of Designation, contained in this response to Item 4 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference and attached hereto as Exhibit 4.

 


Item 5.
INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

 
 

 
Items 5(a) and (b) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated as follows:

 
 

 
(a) – (b) The percentages of Common Stock reported herein are based on 7,354,449 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of August 9, 2016, as reported in the Issuer’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 9, 2016, reflecting the one-for-ten reverse stock split effected by the Issuer on July 7, 2016 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and assumes the conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

 
 

 
The information required by Items 5(a) – (b) is set forth in rows 7 – 13 of the cover page for each of the Reporting Persons and is incorporated herein by reference. The number of shares set forth on the Reporting Persons’ cover pages also gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split.

 
 

 
(c) The Reporting Persons’ response to Item 4 is incorporated by reference into this Item 5(c).

Centerbridge Partners is a multi-strategy private investment firm focused on leveraged buyouts and distressed securities.
The firm manages over $25 billion of assets[1] and is based in New York City, with an additional office in London. The firm invests in both control (private equity and public debt with a "loan-to-own" strategy) and non-control (public market debt, public market equities, and other publicly traded securities) opportunities.
The firm [2] was founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Aronson and Mark Gallogly. Aronson had previously been the head of distressed securities and had founded the leveraged loan business at Angelo, Gordon & Co., which he had joined in 1989 from L.F. Rothschild & Co. Gallogly was formerly a senior managing director and head of private equity investments at the Blackstone Group from 2003 until his departure. At Blackstone, Gallogly was heavily involved in the firm's investments in New Skies Satellites and Sirius Satellite Radio among others and had joined the firm in 1989 from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, where he worked in acquisition finance.
In September 2006, the firm raised its debut fund with $3.2 billion of investor commitments to focus on control investments in distressed securities as well as leveraged buyout transactions.[3][4] The firm also raised a $2 billion noncontrol, activist-oriented credit trading fund known as Centerbridge Special Credit Partners through 2009 and 2010.[5] In 2010, the firm announced plans to begin marketing a second investment fund with a target of $3.75 billion of investor commitments.[6] In 2011, the firm closed its second flagship fund, Centerbridge Partners II, on $4.4 billion, including a commitment from the GP.[7] This was followed by a closing of its $2bn second Special Credit Partners fund in March 2012.[2]
In 2010, Centerbridge won control of Extended Stay Hotels, a company that Gallogly had been involved with at Blackstone.[8]
On 24 September 2010, Centerbridge Capital Partners announced acquisition of 'GMAC Commercial Finance', a subsidiary of Ally Financial.[9]
In 2012, Centerbridge acquired P. F. Chang's China Bistro, a chain of Chinese casual dining restaurants.[10]
On 22 January 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced its agreement to buy Senvion SE from Indian wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon.[11]
On 24 March 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced that they reached an agreement to acquire Great Wolf Resorts, the world's largest chain of indoor water park resorts for $1.35 billion.[12]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
