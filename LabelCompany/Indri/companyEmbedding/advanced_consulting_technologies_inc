                                Modern PC technology allows us to create realistic 3D simulations even for the most complex of automation systems. The participants discover the kinetic dynamism of mechatronic systems using virtual reality – without any risk to human or machine. This allows us to take a step into automation technology without any worries, providing a great motivational boost. Today, simulation represents an important tool in production and product development for analysing new solutions, methods and processes in a quick and low-cost manner. Depending on the task in question, simulation systems come into play which differ from each other in terms of the level of detail of the information to be obtained and the way in which they calculate this information.

Company Summary


ACT is a nanotechnology company which enables electronic components to be effectively and economically water-repellent and not detectable by users either visually or by touch.

Most electronics in the world today are vulnerable to water damage.  Accidental water damage can short out and often ruin the circuitry of cell phones, laptops, e-readers, digital cameras, electronic key fobs, television remotes, coffee makers, and many other devices that are often used in the proximity of water, other liquids, and even simply humidity. While some electronic devices are built and labeled as "water repellent," they are comparatively few in number, and they often feature water-tight external enclosures that house the electronic components inside.

ACT owns the intellectual property of more than 10 revolutionary coatings. ACT is also able to provide expertise in the application of these coatings in a factory environment. ACT participates as an integral team member in testing and adding this process to manufacturing lines for our customers.

ACT offers a number of nano coatings that can be applied to electronic devices in a way that makes them water-repellent to IPx7 levels. In other words, a cell phone or notebook computer will work just fine after being dropped in a bucket of water. This protection is undetectable to the human eye or touch, as it is applied on a nano scale (1 millionth of a millimeter). The coatings can be applied to devices in various stages of the manufacturing process, including after the finished product is built.

ACT delivers unique value to electronic device manufacturers through its ability to adapt the coating and optimized application technology to the needs of each manufacturer.  In some cases, highly economical dipping of components in a nano particle-infused bath is ideal, while in other situations, spraying or wiping is better. ACT is skilled in all aspects of the technology, and advises with each client to help decide where in the manufacturing process this coating should be added and how. Finally, ACT can participate as an integral team member in testing and adding this process to manufacturing lines for its customers.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Visualization Approach
Today’s visualization approach to concept development relieves the burden on companies to document every aspect of a development solution.  In tradition requirements documentation ideas are lost, concepts falls short and processes and misunderstood.  This results in a significant upfront investment from both the consulting firm and client, and often yields an over budget, missed target product.  Using a visualization approach, ATCS partners with clients to first outline a concept aligned with their business strategy followed by development of a working proof of concept with real processing and partial data integration. This rapid and cost effective service allows clients to measure the effectiveness of a concept solution using real time business cases before investing in IT tools.  Learn more…
