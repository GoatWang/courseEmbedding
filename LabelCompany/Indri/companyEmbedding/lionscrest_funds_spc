Financial institutions, businesses and governments are interconnected in ways that are often hard to ascertain or measure.  Leverage through the use of debt has become increasingly prevalent, and volatility has been artificially suppressed through central bank policies.  Although markets are inherently susceptible to periods of instability, in the current global environment, unexpected and highly consequential negative market events, commonly referred to as "Black Swans", are more likely to occur.  When extreme market risk does materialize, the impact is almost instantaneously transmitted from country to country.  In this context, a significant financial crisis can be expected to affect all assets and regions.
















Lionscrest Capital is a boutique investment management firm singularly focused on combining tail hedging (portfolio protection during extreme negative events and crises) with a range of underlying investments to maximize portfolio returns over a full investment cycle.  As a long-standing investor in Universa Investments, foremost expert on hedging tail risk (Black Swans), Lionscrest is able to provide accredited investors with access to Universa’s institutional investment strategies through the Lionscrest Funds platform.  Lionscrest is active in the US, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region.

Most Innovative Capital Investment Fund: Lionscrest SPC
 













The Lionscrest TailPro Funds are invested with Universa Investments LP
Universa is an investment management firm that specializes in tail hedging (i.e. hedging Black Swan) as a means to enhance long-term equity returns. Universa portfolios are, by construction, exceedingly positively-skewed, robust to extreme risk assumptions, and non-linear to common risk factors (such as beta).  Universa's economic edge derives ultimately from basic behavioral biases. Universa captures that edge through a focused and disciplined investment approach employing positively-skewed payoffs, empirical and fundamental-based option valuation, and trading/providing liquidity against systematic order flow imbalances and resulting mispricings in options markets.Universa was founded in January 2007 by CIO Mark Spitznagel, with over a decade of implementation and cumulative, incremental development of its focused, positive asymmetric investment approach. Since the 1990s Universa's principals have worked together and committed themselves to the implementation and cumulative, incremental development of Universa's tail hedging and investing strategies creating an innovative investment niche and risk management methodology within an increasingly homogeneous industry.  Universa is currently registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Mark Spitznagel - President & CIOMark Spitznagel’s 20-year investment career has spanned from Morgan Stanley proprietary trader (head of equity options in the Process Driven Trading group) to partner and President at Empirica Capital LLC to independent pit-trader at the Chicago Board of Trade (the youngest local in the bond pit). Mark received an M.S. in Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and a B.A. from Kalamazoo College. Nassim Taleb - Distinguished Scientific AdvisorNassim Taleb is the author of Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, and Antifragile. Nassim has held senior trading and managerial positions at investment banks and is currently Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at New York University Polytechnic Institute. Nassim received an M.B.A. from Wharton and a Ph.D. from the University of Paris. Eric Spencer, CAIA - CFO/CCO/Head of Investor RelationsPrior to joining Universa, Eric Spencer worked for Northwestern Mutual, which involved designing non-qualified plans and company-specific employee compensation strategies for Fortune 1000 corporations and commercial banks. He was responsible for such duties as running complex P&Ls for these organizations, implementing and overseeing employee benefit programs, closely following regulatory matters, and accounting for benefit accruals. He holds the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) designation, in addition to the Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) and Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designations. Eric received a B.A. from Duke University. Damir Delic - Portfolio ManagerDamir Delic previously worked for KBC Financial Products (the ex-subsidiary of D.E. Shaw) from 2000 to 2008, where he was Senior Vice President. At KBC, Damir was responsible for structuring and distributing the risks of the insurance derivatives book, co-running the relative value volatility strategies within its $1.5B hedge fund (AIM), and implementing in-house relative value arbitrage software. His prior role was as a proprietary trader on KBC’s market making desk in both listed and exotic equity options and overseeing the funding of the New York branch of KBC Financial Products in US Treasuries and in US Equity swaps. Damir graduated from the University of Indianapolis, in affiliation with the University of Nicosia (Cyprus).










The Lionscrest TailPro Strategies
The Lionscrest TailPro strategies invest directly with Universa Investments LP.  Although Universa is only available to the largest institutional investors, through its own funds, Lionscrest is uniquely able to provide accredited investors with direct access to the expertise of Universa and their tail-hedged investment strategies. Universa Black Swan Protection Protocol (BSPP) The BSPP is a risk management product that attempts to protect an investor’s equity portfolio against systemic market shocks and crashes while aiming to preserve capital over time during all other environments. Its goal as a portfolio overlay is to enhance long-term returns for an investor’s overall portfolio while significantly lowering its risk. Universa Black Swan Protected Equity (BSPE) The BSPE is a long equity strategy that attempts to capture asymmetric beta by investing in the broad US equities market as well as a tail hedge strategy (BSPP) to mitigate extreme downside risk. The tail hedge attempts to protect the equity beta portfolio against systemic market shocks and crashes, with the goal to enhance long-term returns while significantly lowering risk. Universa Austrian Investment Fund (AIF) The AIF is an absolute return strategy that invests in portfolios of undervalued US equities and exposures as selected by Universa’s proprietary quantitative screening process, while mitigating the left tail of downside risk through investment in the BSPP strategy. The BSPP serves as a tail hedge that attempts to protect the long equity portion of the portfolio against systemic market shocks and crashes, with the goal of enhancing long-term returns, as well as significantly lowering risk. The paired strategy, which has negative correlation to most common factors (in particular value and momentum and crashes), is the application of the seminal roundabout production and malinvestment concepts of the Austrian School of economics (as outlined in CIO Mark Spitznagel’s The Dao of Capital).

Spitznagel
on the Paradox of Higher Returns with Lower Risk
 








 



















Black Swans
Nassim Taleb (New York Times, April 2007):   "What we call here a Black Swan (and capitalize it) is an event with the following three attributes. First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme impact. Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.  I stop and summarize the triplet: rarity, extreme impact, and retrospective (though not prospective) predictability.










What is Tail Risk?
“Tails” refer to the two ends of a probability distribution with “left tail” events describing the most negative outcomes — such as severe, widespread market shocks which generate large losses— and “right tail” events describing the most positive market outcomes.  “Tail risk” refers to the prospect of left-tail events, which is seen in the left tail of the probability distribution.  Tail events are rare, though more common than would be reflected in a normal distribution (Gaussian) bell curve.  In fact, it turns out tails are “fatter”, that is, more frequent than many people realize.











 
This first chart is a diagram of a normal probability distribution. The horizontal X-axis shows the investment returns (from the lowest on the left to the highest on the right and with the  mean return in the middle).  The vertical Y-axis show the number of observations of each return (for instance, the number of months that produce a +5% gain, the number of months that produce a -5% loss, and so on). 
 



In a normal distribution, the largest number of observations centres around the mean and declines to the right and left, giving it the bell shape as there are typically fewer observations of extreme returns.   Units of standard deviation (‘”sigma”, noted by the symbol δ in the diagram) provide a measurement of the expected frequency of the returns.  In a normal distribution, returns that are generated within one sigma of the mean are predicted to happen 68.5% (roughly two-thirds) of the time.  As noted above, fat tails exist because extreme events are far more prevalent than is explained by the normal distribution.



















(Source: Welton Investment Corporation)

 
These fat tails can be empirically verified (see table on left using data going back 50 years).  What is readily apparent from these analyses is that not only are tail events far more frequent than is generally believed and financial theory predicts, but they are also far greater in magnitude and thus more consequential. The 2008 global financial collapse, a crisis that was completely unexpected by most and had devastating consequences, illuminated very powerfully the reality and seriousness of tail risk. Before the crisis, few people were emphasizing the significance of tail risk for markets and investors; and fewer still were as vocal as Nassim Taleb, the premier specialist on rare events.  Taleb described these risks as “Black Swans”.
 













How often do Black Swans occur?











 
In finance, these consequential Black Swan events happen more often than one might expect; the 1987 stock market crash, the 1990 US and Japanese real estate collapse, the 1998 Russian default and LTCM collapse, the collapse of the 2000 tech market bubble, the collapse of the 2007 real estate bubble, the 2008 stock market crash, the 2010-2011 European, and US debt crisis are all examples of crises that were “obvious” in hindsight but surprising nonetheless during their occurrence.
 













Why is it important to manage tail risk?











 






 






 



The events of 2008 are now widely understood to have been a Black Swan event.  Protecting against these catastrophic events is both necessary and possible.   The series of charts above depict investment profiles with differing degrees of exposure to risks and returns. A “Black Swan” profile describes a high risk of losing everything ("blowing up") - think banking industry in 2008-2009.  A “Robust” profile means safety - think investment in cash.  An “Antrifragile” profile is one that benefits from increased volatility - think tail-hedged portfolios.










How is protecting against ‘Black Swans’ different than managing volatility?
Overall volatility (returns within +/- 1 standard deviation) can often be reduced using traditional diversification techniques (diversification by asset class, geography, industry, cap size, currency, duration etc.).  Black Swans, however, behave differently. The speed and severity of unexpected market declines – like the world witnessed in 2008 – are exacerbated by the interconnectedness of global financial markets and economies.  As a result, correlations amongst asset classes can quickly rise to 1.0, often rendering these diversification techniques virtually useless.Most investors have had to rely on imprecise and often ineffective hedges.  These types of defensive strategies (in addition to the use of simple diversification) are widely available and commonly used by investors:Raising cashMoving into defensive stocksReducing market exposure through short exposure (e.g. short S&P500 ETF)Long volatility (e.g. VIX ETFs)Investing in some sort of defensive swap (e.g. CDS, Total-Return Swaps)Investing in goldThere are pros and cons associated with each of these strategies, but none provides reliable defence against Black Swans.  The protection benefit of the first three strategies results from a correct prediction of the market’s downward direction.  If the prediction is incorrect, however, and the market moves up, either losses mount (due to the short exposure), or the benefits of a rising market are missed (cash and defensive stocks).  A similar risk applies to being outright long volatility via VIX ETFs.  These are market timing risks. With respect to swaps, there is a cost to bear for purchasing the protection.  If the market rises, gains are net of this cost.  But in a true panic - as we experienced during the second part of 2008 - the counterparty to the swap may no longer be able to payout gains, effectively wiping out the usefulness of the swap.  This is not an insignificant risk; one need only remember Lehman and AIG.   Gold, although a very popular hedge, is not at all effective as tail protection.  Typically, in a crisis event, investors are desperate to raise cash to cover their losses and margin calls and thus sell anything liquid and profitable.  In 2008, gold dropped by some 30%.










How does one protect against Black Swans?
There are few methods as effective as a dedicated options strategy, particularly through the use of puts.  However, there are limitations to employing this strategy successfully:Long option strategies where premiums are paid can be very expensive, especially if maintained over an extended period of time;The unexpected nature of Black Swans requires that protection strategies never be allowed to lapse.  An active, “always on” option strategy requires effort, diligence and expertise;Option market bid-offer pricing for deep out-of-the-money (OTM) puts is extremely wide, typically about 500%.  Being able to trade at favourable prices can mean the difference between being able to efficiently implement the strategy or being completely priced out.True options expertise and experience is difficult to access.

The DAO of CAPITAL: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World

As today's preeminent doomsday investor Mark Spitznagel describes his Daoist and roundabout investment approach, “one gains by losing and loses by gaining.”   This is Austrian Investing, an archetypal, counterintuitive, and proven approach, gleaned from the 150-year-old Austrian School of economics, that is both timeless and exceedingly timely.  					In The Dao of Capital, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging  pioneer Mark Spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the  financial crisis, as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping,  circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous  boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to  Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great  economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. 					 					We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian  Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive  battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the  intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming  at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental  challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal  dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring. 					Spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von  Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and—as  Spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology. From  identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market  routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive  assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel “brings  Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio.”  The Dao of Capital provides a rare and accessible look through  the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound  harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today. 								Further Reading:  The Dao of Capital Website 




The Financial Times Lexicon:  Austrian EconomicsA school of economic thought originating in Austria in the late nineteenth century which focuses on the concept of opportunity cost.  In economic theory, the term Austrian School stands for liberalism and laissez-faire-economics (where economic performance is optimised when there is limited government interference).The Austrian School of economics has its original roots in the work of Carl Menger from the University of Vienna . References to the topic were first published in 1871. Well-known followers of Menger included Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk (1851 – 1914), Ludwig von Mises (1881 – 1973) and, perhaps most important, Friedrich A. Hayek (1899 – 1929).Hayek, for example, strongly rejected any intervention by the state in the economy. For him, markets work perfectly in the sense that the market price balances supply and demand.  A perfect market is one characterised by easy access to information, no barriers to entry and with prices controlled by all participants.Due to the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, the popularity of the Austrian School of economics has experienced a boost in recent times because it had predicted, a long time ago, that too much debt – due to too low interest rates – would trigger investment bubbles followed by a crisis after these bubbles burst.  For example, look at Ireland’s property bubble, which was fuelled by reckless lending by banks to property developers.In contrast to Keynesianism, the Austrian School of thought holds that the business cycle is driven by the supply side of the economy, not demand. If interest rates are too low, we will have over-investment. This may lead to over-production, which may trigger a crisis. During the crisis, supply declines until it is once again equal to overall demand. Then a new cycle starts.For the Austrian school, the main challenge is not inflation, but over-investment in the face of too much money, or too-low interest rates that can lead to a crisis.  Too much money means that the growth of money supply is much higher than the growth of goods and services in an economy. This leads to inflation, which is an increase in the average prices of all goods because there is more money available.This means that the right level of the interest rate, called the ‘natural rate of interest’, is crucial to prevent a crisis. This type of interest rate attracts enough investment to ensure full employment and no inflation. If the actual rate is equal to the natural rate, there is no inflation.Further reading:  Ludwig von Mises Institute | Austrian School

Mauldin - Three Black Swans



		23/7/2017
	




 

“The world in which we live has an increasing number of feedback loops, causing events to be the cause of more events (say, people buy a book because other people bought it), thus generating snowballs and arbitrary and unpredictable planet-wide winner-take-all effects.”– Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Black Swan By John MauldinMauldin EconomicsJuly 22, 2017“What do you do?” is a common question Americans ask people they have just met. Some people outside the US consider this rude – as if our jobs define who we are. Not true, of course, but we still feel obliged to answer the question.My work involves so many different things that it isn’t easy to describe. My usual quick answer is that I’m a writer. My readers might say instead: “He tells people what could go wrong.” I like to think of myself as an optimist, and I do often write about my generally optimistic view of the future, but that optimism doesn’t often extend to the performance of governments and central banks. Frankly, we all face economic and financial risks, and we all need to prepare for them. Knowing the risks is the first step toward preparing.Exactly 10 years ago we were months way from a world-shaking financial crisis. By late 2006 we had an inverted yield curve steep and persistent enough to be a high-probability indicator of recession 12 months later. So in late 2006 I was writing about the probability that we would have a recession in 2007. I was also writing about the heavy leverage in the banking system, the ridiculous level of high-yield offerings, the terms and potential turmoil in the bond and banking markets, and the crisis brewing in the subprime market. I wish I had had the money then that a few friends did to massively leverage a short position on the subprime market. I estimated at that time that the losses would be $400 billion at a minimum, whereupon a whole lot of readers and fellow analysts told me I was just way too bearish.Turned out the losses topped well over $2 trillion and triggered the financial crisis and Great Recession. Conditions in the financial markets needed only a spark from the subprime crisis to start a firestorm all over the world. Plenty of things were waiting to go wrong, and it seemed like they all did at the same time. Governments and central bankers scrambled hard to quench the inferno. Looking back, I wish they had done some things differently, but in the heat of battle – a battle these particular people had never faced before, with more going wrong every day – it was hard to be philosophically pure.(Sidebar: I think the Fed's true mistakes were QE2, QE3, and missing their chance to start raising rates in 2013. By then, they had time to more carefully consider those decisions.)We don’t have an inverted yield curve now, so the only truly reliable predictor of recessions in the US is not sounding that warning. But when the central bank artificially holds down short-term rates, it is difficult if not almost impossible for the yield curve to invert.We have effectively suppressed that warning signal, but I am laser focused on factors that could readily trigger a global recession, resulting in another global financial crisis. All is not well in the markets. Yes, we see stock benchmarks pushing to new highs and bond yields at record lows. Inflation benchmarks are stable. Unemployment is low and going lower. GDP growth is slow, but it’s still growth. All that says we shouldn’t worry. Perversely, the signs that we shouldn’t worry are also reasons why we should.This is a classic Minsky teaching moment: Stability breeds instability.I know the bullish arguments for why we can’t have another crisis. Banks are better capitalized now. Regulators are watching more intently. Bondholders are on notice not to expect more bailouts. All that’s true.On the other hand, today’s global megabanks are much larger than their 2008 versions were, and they are more interconnected. Most Americans – the 80% I’ve called the Unprotected – are still licking their wounds from the last battle. Many are in worse shape now than in 2008. Our crisis-fighting reserves are low.European banks are still highly leveraged. The shadow banking system in China has grown to scary proportions.Globalization has proceeded apace since 2008, and the world is even more interconnected now. Problems in faraway markets can quickly become problems close to home. And that’s without a global trade war.I am concerned that another major crisis will ensue by the end of 2018 – though it is possible that a salutary combination of events, aided by complacency, could let us muddle through for another few years. But there is another recession in our future (there is always another recession), and it’s going to be at least as bad as the last one was, in terms of the global pain it causes. The recovery is going to take much longer than the current one has, because our massive debt build-up is a huge drag on growth. I hope I’m wrong. But I would rather write these words now and risk eating them in my 2020 year-end letter than leave you unwarned and unprepared.Because I’m traveling this week, this letter will be just a few appetizers –black swan hot wings, black swan meatballs in orange sauce, teriyaki swan skewers, and the like – to whet your appetite and help you anticipate what’s coming.Seriously speaking, could the three scenarios we discuss below turn out be fateful black swans? Yes. But remember this: A harmless white swan can look black in the right lighting conditions. Sometimes that’s all it takes to start a panic.Black Swan #1: Yellen OvershootsIt is increasingly evident, at least to me, that the US economy is not taking off like the rocket some predicted after the election. President Trump and the Republicans haven’t been able to pass any of the fiscal stimulus measures we hoped to see. Banks and energy companies are getting some regulatory relief, and that helps; but it’s a far cry from the sweeping healthcare reform, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending we were promised. Though serious, major tax reform could postpone a US recession to well beyond 2020, what we are going to get instead is tinkering around the edges.On the bright side, unemployment has fallen further, and discouraged workers are re-entering the labor force. But consumer spending is still weak, so people may be less confident than the sentiment surveys suggest. Inflation has perked up in certain segments like healthcare and housing, but otherwise it’s still low to nonexistent.Is this, by any stretch of the imagination, the kind of economy in which the Federal Reserve should be tightening monetary policy? No – yet the Fed is doing so,  partly because they waited too long to end QE and to begin reducing their balance sheet. FOMC members know they are behind the curve, and they want to pay lip service to doing something before their terms end. Moreover, Janet Yellen, Stanley Fischer, and the other FOMC members are religiously devoted to the Phillips curve. That theory says unemployment this low will create wage-inflation pressure. That no one can see this pressure mounting seems not to matter: It exists in theory and therefore must be countered.The attitude among central bankers, who are basically all Keynesians, is that messy reality should not impinge on elegant theory. You just have to glance at the math to recognize the brilliance of the Phillips curve!It was Winston Churchill who said, “However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.” Fact is, the lack of wage growth among the bottom 70–80% of workers (the Unprotected class) constitutes a real weaknesses in the US economy. If you are a service worker, competition for your job has kept wages down.The black-swan risk here is that the Fed will tighten too much, too soon. We know from recent FOMC minutes that some members have turned hawkish in part because they wanted to offset expected fiscal stimulus from the incoming administration. That stimulus has not been forthcoming, but the FOMC is still acting as if it will be.What happens when the Fed raises interest rates in the early, uncertain stages of a recession instead of lowering them? I’m not sure we have any historical examples to review. Logic suggests the Fed will extinguish any inflation pressure that exists and push the economy in the opposite direction instead, into outright deflation.Deflation in an economy as debt-burdened as ours is could be catastrophic. We would have to repay debt with cash that is gaining purchasing power instead of losing it to inflation. Americans have not seen this happen since the 1930s. It wasn’t fun then, and it would be even less fun now.Worse, I doubt Trump’s FOMC appointees will make a difference. Trump appears to be far more interested in reducing the Fed’s regulatory role than he is in tweaking its monetary policies. I have no confidence that Yellen’s successor, whoever that turns out to be, will know what needs to be done or be able to do it fast enough.Let me make an uncomfortable prediction: I think the Trump Fed – and since Trump will appoint at least six members of the FOMC in the coming year, it will be his Fed – will take us back down the path of massive quantitative easing and perhaps even to negative rates if we enter a recession. The urge to “do something,” or at least be seen as trying to do something, is just going to be too strong.Black Swan #2: ECB Runs Out of BulletsLast week, news reports said that the Greek government is preparing to issue new bonds for the first time in three years. “Issue bonds” is a polite way of saying “borrow more money,” something many bond investors think Greece is not yet ready to do.Their opinions matter less than ECB chief Mario Draghi’s. Draghi is working hard to buy every kind of European paper except that of Greece. Adding Greece to the ECB bond purchases program would certainly help.Relative to the size of the Eurozone economy, Draghi’s stimulus has been far more aggressive then the Fed’s QE. It has pushed both deeper, with negative interest rates, and wider, by including corporate bonds. If you are a major corporation in the Eurozone and the ECB hasn’t loaned you any money or bought your bonds yet, just wait. Small businesses, on the other hand, are being starved.Such interventions rarely end well, but admittedly this one is faring better than most. Europe’s economy is recovering, at least on the surface, as the various populist movements and bank crises fade from view. But are these threats gone or just glossed over? The Brexit negotiations could also throw a wrench in the works.Despite recent predictions by ECB watchers and the euro’s huge move up against the dollar on Friday, Anatole Kaletsky at Gavekal thinks Draghi is still far from reversing course. He expects that the first tightening steps won’t happen until 2018 and anticipates continued bond buying (at a slower pace) and near-zero rates for a long time after. But he also sees risk. Anatole explained in a recent report:Firstly, Fed tapering occurred at a time when Europe and Japan were gearing up to expand monetary stimulus. But when the ECB tapers there won’t be another major central bank preparing a massive balance sheet expansion. It could still turn out, therefore, that the post-crisis recovery in economic activity and the appreciation of asset values was dependent on ever-larger doses of global monetary stimulus. If so, the prophets of doom were only wrong in that they overstated the importance of the Fed’s balance sheet, compared with the balance sheets of the ECB and Bank of Japan.This is a genuine risk, and an analytical prediction about the future on which reasonable people can differ, unlike the factual observations above regarding the revealed behavior of the ECB, the Franco-German rapprochement and the historical experience of Fed tapering.Secondly, it is likely that the euro will rise further against the US dollar if the ECB begins to taper and exits negative interest rates. A stronger euro will at some point become an obstacle to further gains in European equity indexes, which are dominated by export stocks.Anatole makes an important point. The US’s tapering and now tightening coincided with the ECB’s and BOJ’s both opening their spigots. That meant worldwide liquidity was still ample. I don’t see the Fed returning that favor. Draghi and later Kuroda will have to normalize without a Fed backstop – and that may not work so well.Black Swan #3: Chinese Debt MeltdownChina is by all appearances unstoppable. GDP growth has slowed down to 6.9%, according to official numbers. The numbers are likely inflated, but the boom is still underway. Reasonable estimates from knowledgeable observers still have China growing at 4–5%, which, given China’s size, is rather remarkable. The problem lies in the debt fueling the growth.Ambrose Evans-Pritchard reported some shocking numbers in his July 17 Telegraph column. A report from the People’s Bank of China showed off-balance-sheet lending far higher than previously thought and accelerating quickly. (Interestingly, the Chinese have made all of this quite public. And President Xi has taken control of publicizing it.)The huge increase last year probably reflects efforts to jump-start growth following the 2015 downturn. Banks poured fuel on the fire, because letting it go out would have been even worse. But they can’t stoke that blaze indefinitely.President Xi Jinping has been trying to dial back credit growth in the state-owned banks for some time; but in the shadow banks that Xi doesn’t control, credit is growing at an astoundingly high rate, far offsetting any minor cutbacks that Xi has made.Here are a few more juicy quotes from Ambrose:President Xi Jinping called for a hard-headed campaign to curb systemic risk and to flush out “zombie companies”, warning over the weekend that financial stability was a matter of urgent national security.It is the first time that a Chinese leader has chaired the National Finance Work Conference – held every five years to thrash out long-term plans – and is a sign of rising concern as debt reaches 280pc of GDP.In a move that will send shivers up the spines of local party officials, he said they will be held accountable for the rest of their lives for debts that go wrong. Any failure to identify and tackle risks will be deemed “malfeasance”.Ambrose then quotes Patrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management:“The banks have been selling products saying it isn’t our risk. Investors have been buying them saying it’s not our risk either. They all think the government will save everything. So what the markets are pricing is what they think is political risk, not economic risk,” he said.A market in which “they all think the government will save everything” is generally not one you want to own – but China has been an exception. It won’t remain one forever. The collapse, when it comes, could be earthshaking.Chinese growth has been fueled by a near doubling of both GDP and debt over the last nine years.One reason why so many people are complacent about China is that they truly believe that “this time is different” applies to Chinese debt. Maybe in 10 years I will look back and say that it really was different, but I don’t think so. As is often the case with China, China’s current circumstances are without a true equal in the history of the world.And if Xi is really serious about slowing the pace of growth (another form of tightening by a major world economy), that move would just add to overall global risk.It is very possible that any of these black swans could trigger a recession in the US. And let’s be clear: The next US recession will be part of a major global recession and will result in massive new government debt build-up. It will not end well.








 


El-Erian - The Upside and Downside of Liquidity-Driven Markets



		23/7/2017
	




 

by Mohamed A. El-Erian21 July 2017Bloomberg ViewOver the past few months, government bond yields have fallen, the dollar has weakened and financials have underperformed, yet the major stock indexes are at or very near record highs, as persistently supportive liquidity conditions have more than compensated for policy and growth disappointments. By boosting returns and repressing volatility, ample liquidity is a gift for investors. It makes the investment journey pleasing, comfortable and lengthy. But it is not a destination.With the exception of buoyant stock market indexes, it is hard to find many financial markets that have managed to retain their post-U.S. election mood. Specifically: After climbing to 2.60 percent, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has fallen to below 2.30 percent.The yield differential between U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds has narrowed from more than 220 basis points to just 170 basis points.The widely followed DXY dollar index, which reached a high of 103 on Dec. 28, has depreciated sharply to 94, a level not seen since August of last year.The Mexican peso has appreciated to its strongest level in a year, after falling sharply on fears of U.S. protectionism.Much of this reflects the process of markets repricing to lower expectations for U.S. growth and for Federal Reserve policy tightening compared to the rest of the world, and especially relative to Europe and the European Central Bank. The main reason for this is reduced hopes for a rapid economic policy breakthrough powered by the implementation of tax reform and infrastructure programs.Despite Republican majorities in both chambers, Congress has struggled to come together on major legislation, most visibly health care (an issue that dominated the party’s narrative during the campaign). This has delayed pro-growth economic bills, while making their prospects more uncertain. With Fed monetary measures already stretched, there has been little policy offset to a soft patch in indicators of household and corporate economic activity.Yet none of this seems to have been reflected in the major stock indexes. All three -- the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P -- registered more record highs this week. In the process, the leadership of the market has returned to tech and other disruptors, after a brief but intense post-election romance with financials and industrials deemed to be the largest beneficiary of Trumponomics.The markets’ overall sense of "goldilocks" -- not too hot, not too cold -- explains much of the gap between buoyant stock indexes and lagging economic and policy fundamentals.Growth may be low, but the markets perceive it as relatively stable. The Trump administration has not followed through on protectionist measures that would threaten a global trade war. Concerns about disruptive European politics, to the extent they even registered in stock markets, have been alleviated by President Emmanuel Macron’s victory in France.  Interest rates continue to be low throughout the advanced world, with markets also marking down their expectations of Fed tightening in the last few weeks. Two systemically important central banks, the ECB and the Bank of Japan, continue to provide a lot of liquidity, and on a predictable monthly schedule; and, as signaled on Thursday by ECB President Mario Draghi, they seem in no rush to taper, despite the improvement in economic conditions. Moreover, with corporate balance sheets flush with cash, valuations are also influenced by understandable expectations of more dividends, stock buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions.Liquidity, especially when ample and predictable, can fuel markets and condition investor behavior in a supportive manner for quite a while. But when judged against the objective of durable long-term gains, it is best seen as part of the investment journey. The destination, however, doesn't depend on liquidity alone. Economic and corporate fundamentals play a much larger role.So far, equity investors have experienced an unusually long and fulfilling journey -- one that, absent a major accident, could last a little longer. What remains more elusive, however, is confidence that this will end up at an enjoyable destination.But the most reassuring factor for traders and investors remains very loose financial conditions.








 


Spitznagel - The Part-Time Critics of Central Banks



		16/7/2017
	




 

by Mark SpitznagelThe Mises Institute14 July, 2017There seems to be no shortage today of investors and pundits criticizing the market interventions of the world’s central banks. Monetary stimulus in the form of artificially low interest rates and bloated central bank balance sheets ($18.5 trillion, to be exact), the argument goes, have created another dangerous financial bubble (evidenced by ubiquitously bubbly stock market valuation ratios) that ultimately threatens the financial system yet again. The author shares wholeheartedly in this criticism.The ethical problem is, where were these voices when this all started, with Greenspan in the 1990s and, more specifically, with Bernanke in 2008? The central bank critics today who were not critics of — and in most cases were even sympathetic to — the great bailouts and stimulus that started almost a decade ago have reserved their criticisms only for those interventions that appear to hurt their interests, as opposed to those that have helped them. After all, no one would disagree that bailouts and monetary stimulus got us out of the last financial crisis, but they also certainly got us to where we are today, vulnerable to another even bigger one.We are so concerned about our friend the strung-out junkie, though we paid little mind when they were but a casual user. It is so easy to care when problems become obvious and critical, so hard when they are subtler and nascent. Artificial stimulus in an economy is the same: it is easily ignored as a problem in its infancy, but it always develops into a huge problem. Economies and markets are structurally altered and distorted by such stimulus, such that it cannot be removed without breaking those new structures. It must rather be ever increased, though even this will only delay an inevitable collapse.It is just too easy in today’s investing environment, and even necessary for most participants, to sympathize with and even exploit central bank interventions. Doing otherwise creates an opportunity cost in one’s career and investments. But doing so puts one in the position of enabler to the economic system’s self-destructive dependence on artificial stimulus. One cannot be a part-time classical liberal, criticizing central planning only when it runs contrary to one’s interests. Indeed, this is the very problem of Socialism: there are winners and losers; the winners are in the here and now — the seen; the losers are in the future — the unseen. The winners don't complain, and the losers can‘t until it is too late.But as the future becomes the here and now, the unseen becomes the seen, those who now think they are anticipating a problem and its cause, yet supported that same cause when they stood to benefit, must be seen for what they are: fellow travelers in the central planning ideology that grips today’s financial markets. They are too late.

IRA - Fade the Great Rotation into Europe



		6/7/2017
	




 

by R. Christopher WhalenInstitutional Risk AnalystJuly 6, 2017News last week that European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi was considering an end to the ECB’s extraordinary purchases of securities quickly let some air out of the Great Rotation into EU stocks.  Sure the euro surged against a weakening dollar, but Europe’s mountain of bad debt remains unresolved -- even after the election of Emmanuel Macron to the French presidency.  Yet hope springs eternal in some quarters after Draghi’s claim of a successful “reflation.”“All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area,” Draghi told the ECB’s annual conference. “Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,” the former head of the Bank of Italy declared. Draghi’s bull call on inflation provides optimism for relief on excessive levels of bad debt, albeit in a context where the EU’s rules on resolving dead banks remain entirely subjective.The July 4 approval of the latest state-supported rescue for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Montepaschi) illustrates the deflationary challenges still facing Europe.  As part of the overhaul, Reuters reports, Montepaschi “will transfer 26.1 billion euros to a privately funded special vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by Italian bank rescue fund Atlante II.”  The bank will receive 5 billion euros in new public equity funds for its third bailout in a decade.Two weeks before the EU decision on rescuing Montepaschi, the Italian government supported the sale of two profoundly insolvent Italian banks.  The assets of Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca were sold to Intesa SanPaolo Group at an estimated cost to the government of 10 billion euros, marking Italy’s latest breech of the EU’s rules on state support for failing financial institutions.Like Montepaschi, where retail investors were heavily subsidized, the Intesa SanPaolo transaction avoids imposing losses on senior debt and depositors, but wipes out the equity and junior debt.  This outcome reflects political as well as financial constraints in Italy, but shows how far there is to go in the process of resolving bad banks in Europe.Of note, Italy is being given control over the remaining “bad bank” to wind down as the assets and deposits are conveyed to Intesa SanPaolo.  This permits a bailout of senior unsecured creditors.  So Italy gets what it wants – continued circumvention of EU bailout rules. If a bank disappears, notes a well-placed EU observer, “state aid rules do not apply."Compare the sale of these two insolvent Italian banks with the resolution in early June of Banco Popular Espanol, which became the first EU bank to be resolved by the EU’s Single Resolution Board (SRB).  Banco Popular had a third of total assets in bad loans and real estate owned, double the 15% average for all banks in Spain.  (In the US, by comparison, non-performing loans plus real estate owned equaled less than 1% of total assets for all banks at the end of Q1 2017.)  “The resolution of Banco Popular, under which it was acquired by Banco Santander S.A., is consistent with the EU’s Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD),” Moody’s notes, “which restricts the use of public funds to rescue failing banks. The route followed by the EU authorities in the case of Banco Popular contrasts with the approach taken elsewhere to other ailing banks, notably in the case of the troubled Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.”The state bailout of Montepaschi, like the sale of the two smaller banks to Intesa SanPaolo, reflects political realities in Italy. “Montepaschi’s liability structure includes large volumes of bonds purchased by retail investors before the [Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive] introduction,” Moody’s continues. “Retail investors also accounted for around 40% of Banco Popular’s share capital and also held an undisclosed share of the bank’s Tier 2 instruments.”Well-advised institutional investors fled Italian banks years ago, partly because they could not trust official disclosure.  So the Rome government countenanced the sale of “deposits” to retail investors by Montepaschi and other Italian zombie banks.  The process of selling the deposits and good assets of the two Italian zombie banks to Intesa SanPaolo, while retaining the toxic waste in a “bad bank”, represents the true cost of this latest example of moral hazard in Europe.Draghi deserves considerable credit for the worsening situation at Montepaschi, starting with his tenure at the Bank of Italy.  When the bank merged with Antonveneta, a troubled bank it bought from Spain’s Santander, Montepaschi’s troubles accelerated.  Italy's third-biggest lender, received a 4 billion euro state bailout in 2012.The negative political consequences for the current government in Rome of the latest Montepaschi bailout are still unfolding, but Draghi and his fellow technocrats are the true authors of this mess.  More, EU banks still face levels of bad debts that not only indicate insolvency, but under the EU’s often ignored fiscal rules, suggest a haircut for senior debt and depositors without state aid.As with the EU today, American officials in the late 1970s and 1980s bent the rules regarding bank disclosure to enable most of the larger, internationally active US banks to avoid a painful debt restructuring.  The Latin debt crisis, trouble in the oil patch, and the S&L debacle pushed some of America’s largest banks to the edge of bankruptcy, starting a process of deregulation that is still little understood by investors and analysts.The Federal Reserve Board under Chairman Paul Volcker and other regulators allowed large banks to engage in off-balance sheet financial transactions that concealed tens of billions in loan exposures. This loosening of prudential standards regarding the treatment of off-balance sheet securities deals eventually led to the 2008 financial collapse. Three decades later, when concealed structured investment vehicles came back to issuers like Citigroup (NYSE:C), the results were disastrous.Today, officials in Europe led by ECB chief Mario Draghi are playing a similar game, pretending that bad public and private debt on the books of EU banks and investment houses, and held by individuals, is somehow money good.  As with the US in the 1980s, the stark reality inside the EU banking system is being concealed under a heavy dose of technocratic obfuscation.Mountains of public debt in Europe also indicate proponents of the bullish EU equity trade may be a tad exuberant.  Europe just dodged a bullet in Greece, where a last-minute deal with the International Monetary Fund allowed the member nations to kick the can down the road until next year.  With debt at 200% of GDP, Greece is crippled economically and requires debt reduction in order to attract new investment.  Over the past few months, investors have driven yields on Greek debt to the lowest level in years.  To that point, investor optimism on the EU is predicated on an eventual debt bailout for Greece.  Yet investors won't see any details on a long awaited Greek debt restructuring plan before the German elections later this year.  The EU trade, as it were, depends an awful lot on what happens to Angela Merkel’s coalition this September.Economic reality is slowly leading the EU down the road to the assumption of bad debt of weaker states by the stronger members of the federation led by Germany. EU economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici has called for “debt reduction” in Greece, a proposal that is met with a lukewarm response by Germans.  But will Merkel ultimately go along?"In the long run, in a completely integrated euro zone, we would talk about a ‘communitization’ of new debt, but we're not going to start with that," Moscovici told reporters last week.The necessary condition for the bull case on the EU is that the Germans must eventually embrace a federated structure for Europe, this as part of a gradual approach being advanced by leaders such as Macron in France and Moscovici in Brussels.Joint and several responsibility for all EU debts is the cost of unity.  Such a scenario faces significant political and practical obstacles, most notably in Germany but also in France, where Macron must somehow convince his citizens to embrace German style economic behavior.A gradualist plan for a European federation seems unworkable so long as member states are able to borrow against Europe’s collective credit without toeing the line on fiscal reforms – as in the case of Italy and its troubled banks.“The euro crisis resulted from the fallacy that a monetary union would evolve into a political union,” writes Yanis Varoufakis, a former finance minister of Greece.  “Today, a new gradualist fallacy threatens Europe: the belief that a federation-lite will evolve into a viable democratic federation.”








 


Mauldin - The Next Minsky Moment



		19/6/2017
	




 

by John MauldinMauldin EconomicsJune 18, 2017The Next Minsky MomentEconomics has its overused themes and phrases, too. One is “Minsky moment,” the point at which excess debt sparks a financial crisis. The late Hyman Minsky said that such moments arise naturally when a long period of stability and complacency eventually leads to the buildup of excess debt and overleveraging. At some point the branch breaks, and gravity takes over. It can happen quickly, too.Minsky studied under Schumpeter and was clearly influenced by many of the classical economists. But he must be given credit for formalizing what were only suggestions or incomplete ideas and turning them into powerful economic themes. I’ve often felt that Minsky did not get the credit he deserved. I look at some of the piddling ideas that earn Nobel prizes in economics and compare them to the importance of Minsky’s work, and I get an inkling of the political nature of economics prizes.Minsky’s model of the credit system, which he dubbed the “financial instability hypothesis” (FIH), incorporated many ideas already circulated by John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall, Knut Wicksell and Irving Fisher. “A fundamental characteristic of our economy,” Minsky wrote in 1974, “is that the financial system swings between robustness and fragility, and these swings are an integral part of the process that generates business cycles.” [Wikipedia]Minsky came to mind because in the past week I saw yet more signs that financial markets are overvalued and investors excessively optimistic. Yet I still haven’t seen many references to Minsky. That’s a little surprising.On reflection, I realized I hadn’t mentioned Minsky lately, either. That is a potentially dangerous oversight, because we forget his fundamental insights at our peril. Last week’s brief technology tumble should have been a wake-up call. So today we’ll have a little Minsky refresher and look at some recent danger signs. And I predict that we will soon see Minsky mentions popping up everywhere.Natural InstabilityHyman Minsky, who passed away in 1996, spent most of his academic career studying financial crises. He wanted to know what caused them and what triggered them. His research all led up to his Financial Instability Hypothesis. He thought crises had a lot to do with debt. Minsky wasn’t against all debt, though. He separated it into three categories.The safest kind of debt Minsky called “hedge financing.” For example, a business borrows to increase production capacity and uses a reasonable part of its current cash flow to repay the interest and principal. The debt is not risk-free, but failures generally have only limited consequences.Minsky’s second and riskier category is “speculative financing.” The difference between speculative and hedge debt is that the holder of speculative debt uses current cash flow to pay interest but assumes it will be able to roll over the principal and repay it later. Sometimes that works out. Borrowers can play the game for years and finally repay speculative debt. But it’s one of those arrangements that tends to work well until it doesn’t.It’s the third kind of debt that Minsky said was most dangerous: Ponzi financing is where borrowers lack the cash flow to cover either interest or principal. Their plan, if you can call it that, is to flip the underlying asset at a higher price, repay the debt, and book a profit.Ponzi financing can work. Sometimes people have good timing (or just good luck) and buy a leveraged asset before it tops out. The housing bull market of 2003–07, when people with almost no credit were buying and flipping houses and making money, attracted more and more people and created a soaring market. The phenomenon fed on itself. Bull markets in houses, stocks, or anything else can go higher and persist longer than we skeptics think is possible. That is what makes them so dangerous.Minsky’s unique contribution here is the sequencing of events. Protracted stable periods where hedge financing works encourage both borrowers and lenders to take more risk. Eventually once-prudent practices give way to Ponzi schemes. At some point, asset values stop going up. They don’t have to fall, mind you, just stop rising. That’s when crisis hits.The Economist described this process well in a 2016 Minsky profile article. (Emphasis mine.)Economies dominated by hedge financing – that is, those with strong cashflows and low debt levels – are the most stable. When speculative and, especially, Ponzi financing come to the fore, financial systems are more vulnerable. If asset values start to fall, either because of monetary tightening or some external shock, the most overstretched firms will be forced to sell their positions. This further undermines asset values, causing pain for even more firms. They could avoid this trouble by restricting themselves to hedge financing. But over time, particularly when the economy is in fine fettle, the temptation to take on debt is irresistible. When growth looks assured, why not borrow more? Banks add to the dynamic, lowering their credit standards the longer booms last. If defaults are minimal, why not lend more? Minsky’s conclusion was unsettling. Economic stability breeds instability. Periods of prosperity give way to financial fragility.Minsky’s conclusions are indeed unsettling. He called into question the belief that markets, left to operate unimpeded, will deliver stability and prosperity to all. Minsky thought the opposite. Markets are not efficient at all, and the result is an occasional financial crisis.Complacency in the midst of a wanton debt buildup was beautifully expressed in a remark by Citigroup Chairman Chuck Prince in 2007:  The Citigroup chief executive told the Financial Times that the party would end at some point, but there was so much liquidity it would not be disrupted by the turmoil in the US subprime mortgage market.He denied that Citigroup, one of the biggest providers of finance to private equity deals, was pulling back.“When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” [source]Minsky wasn’t around to see the 2008 crisis that fit right into his theory. Paul McCulley attached Minsky’s name to it, though, and now we refer to these crises as “Minsky moments.”Are we closing in on one now?Learning the RulesAs I mentioned, technology stocks suffered from a little anxiety attack in the markets last week. It didn’t not last long and really wasn’t all that serious. (Yet.) It was nothing worse than what everyone called “normal volatility” ten years ago. But the lack of concern it generated this time is not bullish, in my view. More than a few investors seem to think that “nowhere but up” is somehow normal.Doug Kass had similar thoughts (there’s that Zeitgeist trope thing again) and reminded us all of Bob Farrell’s famous Ten Rules of Investing. You could write a book about each one of them. I’ll just list them quickly, then apply some of them to our current situation. (Emphasis mine.)1. Markets tend to return to the mean over time.2. Excesses in one direction will lead to an opposite excess in the other direction.3. There are no new eras – excesses are never permanent.4. Exponential rapidly rising or falling markets usually go further than you think, but they do not correct by going sideways.5. The public buys most at the top and the least at the bottom.6. Fear and greed are stronger than long-term resolve.7. Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue-chip names. (Sound familiar? Can you say FAANGs?)8. Bear markets have three stages: sharp down, reflexive rebound, and a drawn-out fundamental downtrend.9. When all the experts and forecasts agree, something else is going to happen.10. Bull markets are more fun than bear markets.I think most of these rules are obvious to investors who experienced the 2008 mess, the dot-com crash, and (if you’re of a certain age) the 1987 Black Monday. Some of us can remember 1980 and ’82. ’82 was especially ugly. (I had just gotten my master of divinity degree, and all I knew was that the job market sucked.) Maybe we mostly forget these experiences, but hopefully we pick up a little wisdom along the way. The problem is that now a new generation of investors lacks this perspective. They had little or no stock exposure in 2008 and experienced the Great Recession as more of a job-loss or housing crisis than a stock market crisis.Of course, the previous crises are no secret. People know about them, and on some level they know the bear will come prowling around again, eventually. But knowing history isn’t the same as living through it. Newer investors may not notice the signs of a top as readily as do investors who have seen those signs before – and who maybe got punished for ignoring them at the time.Doug Kass notices. Here’s a bit from an e-mail conversation we had last week.During the dot.com boom in 1997 to early 2000 there was the promise (and dream) of a new paradigm and concentration of performance in a select universe of stocks. The Nasdaq subsequently dropped by about 85% over the next few years.I got to thinking how many conditions that existed back then exist today – most importantly, like in 1999, when there emerged the untimely notion of “The Long Boom” in Wired magazine. It was a new paradigm of a likely extended period of uninterrupted economic prosperity and became an accepted investment feature and concept in support of higher stock prices!And in 2007 new-fangled financial weapons of mass destruction – such as subprime mortgages that were sliced and diced during a worldwide stretch for yield – were seen as safe by all but a few.And, just like during those previous periods of speculative excesses, many of the same strategists, commentators, and money managers who failed to warn us then are now ignoring/dismissing (their favorite phrase is that the “macroeconomic backdrop is benign”) the large systemic risks that arguably have contributed to an overvalued and over-loved U.S. stock market.Doug points especially to Farrell’s Rule 7, on market breadth. A rally led by a few intensely popular, must-own stocks is much less sustainable than one that lifts all boats. We see it right now in the swelling interest in FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). Tesla comes to mind, too. Their influence on the cap-weighted indexes is undeniably distorting the market. These situations rarely end well.Chinese MinskyWhat is behind these distortions? Ultimately, it’s about capital flows. Asset prices rise when demand outstrips supply, which is what happens when stocks or real estate or whatever are perceived as more rewarding than cash. Those with the most unwanted cash compete with each other to buy the alternatives.The Fed and other developed-country central banks created a lot of liquidity in recent years, so that’s undoubtedly a factor. An even greater one may be China, though.Consider China’s explosive growth. Its proximate cause is US demand and, to a lesser extent, European demand for Chinese exports. We sent them our dollars and euros; they sent us widgets and doodads. US dollars inside China are undesirable to wealthy Chinese and the Chinese government, so they send the dollars right back to us in exchange for other assets: homes, commercial real estate, stocks, Treasury bonds, entire companies.Meanwhile, within China, the government aggressively encourages lending for projects a free economy would never produce. Let me make a critical point here: While the central bank of China is not doing much in the way of quantitative easing, the government’s use of bank lending gone wild is essentially the same thing. The banks have created multiple trillions of yuan every year for many years. If you add Chinese bank lending statistics to the quantitative easing statistics of the world’s major central banks, the number is staggering. I think it’s entirely appropriate to perform that calculation.Beijing thinks this massive bank lending is useful in keeping the population happy, employed, and satisfied with their government. It has worked pretty well, too. It can’t work indefinitely, but the government seems bent on trying. Consider this June 14 Wall Street Journal report.While Beijing is carrying out a high-profile campaign to reduce leverage in its financial markets with one hand, with the other it is encouraging more potentially reckless borrowing. This week, the regulator put pressure on the country’s big banks to lend more to small companies and farmers, while the government announced tax breaks for financial institutions that lend to rural households. That follows recent guidance that banks should set up “inclusive finance” units.If the goal of lending to poorer customers sounds noble, the concern is that the execution will only worsen Chinese banks’ existing problems, namely high levels of bad loans and swaths of mispriced credit. Bank lending to small companies is already growing pretty fast, with non-trivial sums involved: It jumped 17% in the year through March to 27.8 trillion yuan ($4.084 trillion). That compares favorably with the 7% rise in loans to large- and medium-size companies over the same period.Observers like me have been saying for years that China’s banking system is overleveraged and will eventually collapse. We’ve been wrong so far. Beijing’s central planners may be Communists, but they use the capitalist toolbox to their advantage. China will eventually face a reckoning. When it does, the impact will spread far outside China. What do you think will happen when Chinese money stops buying Vancouver real estate and US stocks? The outcome won’t be bullish.The Swiss National Bank Is Doing What?Pity the poor Swiss government. They have run their country well and don’t have a great deal of debt. They are a small country of just 8 million people, but they make an outsized impact on economics and finance and money.Because Switzerland is considered a safe haven and a well-run country, many people would like to hold large amounts of their assets in the Swiss franc. Which makes the Swiss franc intolerably strong for Swiss businesses and citizens. So the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has to print a great deal of money and use nonconventional means to hold down the value of their currency. Their overnight repo rate is -0.75%. That’s right, they charge you a little less than 1% a year just for the pleasure of letting your cash sit in a Swiss bank deposit.And the SNB is buying massive quantities of dollars and euros, paid for by printing hundreds of billions in Swiss francs. The SNB owns about $80 billion in US stocks today (June, 2017) and a guesstimated $20 billion or so in European stocks (which guess comes from my friend Grant Williams, so I will go with it).They have bought roughly $17 billion worth of US stocks so far this year. They have no formula; they are just trying to manage their currency. Think about this for a moment: They have about $1000 in US stocks on their books for every man, woman, and child in Switzerland, not to mention who knows how much in other assorted assets, all in the effort to keep a lid on what is still one of the most expensive currencies in the world. I gasp at prices every time I go to Switzerland. (I will be in Lugano for the first time this fall.)Switzerland is now the eighth-largest public holder of US stocks. It has got to be one of the largest holders of Apple (see below). What happens when there is a bear market? Who bears the losses? Print just more money to make up the difference on the balance sheet? Do we even care what the Swiss National Bank balance sheet looks like? More importantly, do they really care? We all remember European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s famous remark, that he would do “whatever it takes” to defend the euro. We could hear the Swiss singing from the same hymnbook, by and by.The point is that central banks and governments all the world are flooding the market with liquidity, which is showing up in the private asset markets, in stock and housing and real estate and bond prices, creating an unquenchable desire for what appear to be cheap but are actually overvalued assets – which is what creates a Minsky moment.Now, remember what Minsky said. When an economy reaches the Ponzi-financing stage, it becomes extremely sensitive to asset prices. Any downturn or even an extended flat period can trigger a crisis.While we have many domestic issues that could act as that trigger, I see a high likelihood that the next Minsky moment will propagate from China or Europe. All the necessary excesses and transmission channels are in place. The hard part, of course, is the timing. The Happy Daze can linger far longer than any of us anticipate. Then again, some seemingly insignificant event in Europe or China – an Austrian Archduke’s being assassinated, or what have you – can cause the world to unravel.It’s a funny world. We have our rashes of zombie moves and 20 people in all corners of the planet inventing the same thing at the same time. And we have our central banks and governments exhibiting unmistakable herd behavior and continuing to do the same foolish things over and over. They never really intend to have the crisis that ensues.Remember Farrell’s Rule 3: There are no new eras. The world changes, but danger remains. Gravity always wins eventually. It will win this time, too. And when it does, we will begin undergo the Great Reset.








 


Lewis - Don’t Eat Fortune’s Cookie



		13/6/2017
	




 

by Michael LewisJune 3, 2012Princeton UniversityThank you. President Tilghman. Trustees and Friends. Parents of the Class of 2012. Above all, Members of the Princeton Class of 2012. Give yourself a round of applause. The next time you look around a church and see everyone dressed in black it’ll be awkward to cheer. Enjoy the moment.Thirty years ago I sat where you sat. I must have listened to some older person share his life experience. But I don’t remember a word of it. I can’t even tell you who spoke. What I do remember, vividly, is graduation. I’m told you’re meant to be excited, perhaps even relieved, and maybe all of you are. I wasn’t. I was totally outraged. Here I’d gone and given them four of the best years of my life and this is how they thanked me for it. By kicking me out.At that moment I was sure of only one thing: I was of no possible economic value to the outside world. I’d majored in art history, for a start. Even then this was regarded as an act of insanity. I was almost certainly less prepared for the marketplace than most of you. Yet somehow I have wound up rich and famous. Well, sort of. I’m going to explain, briefly, how that happened. I want you to understand just how mysterious careers can be, before you go out and have one yourself.I graduated from Princeton without ever having published a word of anything, anywhere. I didn’t write for the Prince, or for anyone else. But at Princeton, studying art history, I felt the first twinge of literary ambition. It happened while working on my senior thesis. My adviser was a truly gifted professor, an archaeologist named William Childs. The thesis tried to explain how the Italian sculptor Donatello used Greek and Roman sculpture — which is actually totally beside the point, but I’ve always wanted to tell someone. God knows what Professor Childs actually thought of it, but he helped me to become engrossed. More than engrossed: obsessed. When I handed it in I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: to write senior theses. Or, to put it differently: to write books.Then I went to my thesis defense. It was just a few yards from here, in McCormick Hall. I listened and waited for Professor Childs to say how well written my thesis was. He didn’t. And so after about 45 minutes I finally said, “So. What did you think of the writing?”“Put it this way” he said. “Never try to make a living at it.”And I didn’t — not really. I did what everyone does who has no idea what to do with themselves: I went to graduate school. I wrote at nights, without much effect, mainly because I hadn’t the first clue what I should write about. One night I was invited to a dinner, where I sat next to the wife of a big shot at a giant Wall Street investment bank, called Salomon Brothers. She more or less forced her husband to give me a job. I knew next to nothing about Salomon Brothers. But Salomon Brothers happened to be where Wall Street was being reinvented—into the place we have all come to know and love. When I got there I was assigned, almost arbitrarily, to the very best job in which to observe the growing madness: they turned me into the house expert on derivatives. A year and a half later Salomon Brothers was handing me a check for hundreds of thousands of dollars to give advice about derivatives to professional investors.Now I had something to write about: Salomon Brothers. Wall Street had become so unhinged that it was paying recent Princeton graduates who knew nothing about money small fortunes to pretend to be experts about money. I’d stumbled into my next senior thesis.I called up my father. I told him I was going to quit this job that now promised me millions of dollars to write a book for an advance of 40 grand. There was a long pause on the other end of the line. “You might just want to think about that,” he said.“Why?”“Stay at Salomon Brothers 10 years, make your fortune, and then write your books,” he said.I didn’t need to think about it. I knew what intellectual passion felt like — because I’d felt it here, at Princeton — and I wanted to feel it again. I was 26 years old. Had I waited until I was 36, I would never have done it. I would have forgotten the feeling.The book I wrote was called “Liar’s Poker.” It sold a million copies. I was 28 years old. I had a career, a little fame, a small fortune and a new life narrative. All of a sudden people were telling me I was born to be a writer. This was absurd. Even I could see there was another, truer narrative, with luck as its theme. What were the odds of being seated at that dinner next to that Salomon Brothers lady? Of landing inside the best Wall Street firm from which to write the story of an age? Of landing in the seat with the best view of the business? Of having parents who didn’t disinherit me but instead sighed and said “do it if you must?” Of having had that sense of must kindled inside me by a professor of art history at Princeton? Of having been let into Princeton in the first place?This isn’t just false humility. It’s false humility with a point. My case illustrates how success is always rationalized. People really don’t like to hear success explained away as luck — especially successful people. As they age, and succeed, people feel their success was somehow inevitable. They don’t want to acknowledge the role played by accident in their lives. There is a reason for this: the world does not want to acknowledge it either.I wrote a book about this, called “Moneyball.” It was ostensibly about baseball but was in fact about something else. There are poor teams and rich teams in professional baseball, and they spend radically different sums of money on their players. When I wrote my book the richest team in professional baseball, the New York Yankees, was then spending about $120 million on its 25 players. The poorest team, the Oakland A’s, was spending about $30 million. And yet the Oakland team was winning as many games as the Yankees — and more than all the other richer teams.This isn’t supposed to happen. In theory, the rich teams should buy the best players and win all the time. But the Oakland team had figured something out: the rich teams didn’t really understand who the best baseball players were. The players were misvalued. And the biggest single reason they were misvalued was that the experts did not pay sufficient attention to the role of luck in baseball success. Players got given credit for things they did that depended on the performance of others: pitchers got paid for winning games, hitters got paid for knocking in runners on base. Players got blamed and credited for events beyond their control. Where balls that got hit happened to land on the field, for example.Forget baseball, forget sports. Here you had these corporate employees, paid millions of dollars a year. They were doing exactly the same job that people in their business had been doing forever. In front of millions of people, who evaluate their every move. They had statistics attached to everything they did. And yet they were misvalued — because the wider world was blind to their luck.This had been going on for a century. Right under all of our noses. And no one noticed — until it paid a poor team so well to notice that they could not afford not to notice. And you have to ask: if a professional athlete paid millions of dollars can be misvalued who can’t be? If the supposedly pure meritocracy of professional sports can’t distinguish between lucky and good, who can?The “Moneyball” story has practical implications. If you use better data, you can find better values; there are always market inefficiencies to exploit, and so on. But it has a broader and less practical message: don’t be deceived by life’s outcomes. Life’s outcomes, while not entirely random, have a huge amount of luck baked into them. Above all, recognize that if you have had success, you have also had luck — and with luck comes obligation. You owe a debt, and not just to your Gods. You owe a debt to the unlucky.I make this point because — along with this speech — it is something that will be easy for you to forget.I now live in Berkeley, California. A few years ago, just a few blocks from my home, a pair of researchers in the Cal psychology department staged an experiment. They began by grabbing students, as lab rats. Then they broke the students into teams, segregated by sex. Three men, or three women, per team. Then they put these teams of three into a room, and arbitrarily assigned one of the three to act as leader. Then they gave them some complicated moral problem to solve: say what should be done about academic cheating, or how to regulate drinking on campus.Exactly 30 minutes into the problem-solving the researchers interrupted each group. They entered the room bearing a plate of cookies. Four cookies. The team consisted of three people, but there were these four cookies. Every team member obviously got one cookie, but that left a fourth cookie, just sitting there. It should have been awkward. But it wasn’t. With incredible consistency the person arbitrarily appointed leader of the group grabbed the fourth cookie, and ate it. Not only ate it, but ate it with gusto: lips smacking, mouth open, drool at the corners of their mouths. In the end all that was left of the extra cookie were crumbs on the leader’s shirt.This leader had performed no special task. He had no special virtue. He’d been chosen at random, 30 minutes earlier. His status was nothing but luck. But it still left him with the sense that the cookie should be his.This experiment helps to explain Wall Street bonuses and CEO pay, and I’m sure lots of other human behavior. But it also is relevant to new graduates of Princeton University. In a general sort of way you have been appointed the leader of the group. Your appointment may not be entirely arbitrary. But you must sense its arbitrary aspect: you are the lucky few. Lucky in your parents, lucky in your country, lucky that a place like Princeton exists that can take in lucky people, introduce them to other lucky people, and increase their chances of becoming even luckier. Lucky that you live in the richest society the world has ever seen, in a time when no one actually expects you to sacrifice your interests to anything.All of you have been faced with the extra cookie. All of you will be faced with many more of them. In time you will find it easy to assume that you deserve the extra cookie. For all I know, you may. But you’ll be happier, and the world will be better off, if you at least pretend that you don’t.Never forget: In the nation’s service. In the service of all nations.Thank you.  And good luck.

Whalen - Macro-Prudential Delusions: Bank Credit Outlook 2H 2017



		30/5/2017
	




 

by R. CHristopher WhalenThe Institutional Risk AnalystMay 29, 2017In the mid 2000s, just before the financial crisis began, US banks were reporting credit metrics for all asset classes in loan portfolios that were quite literally too good to be true.  And they were.  The cost of bad credit decisions was hidden, for a time, by rising asset prices.The same aggressive, low-rate environment used by the Fed to artificially stoke growth in the early 2000s has been repeated in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, only to a greater extreme.  Today US banks report credit metrics in many loan categories that are not merely too good, but are entirely anomalous.  Negative default rates, for example, are a red flag.A decade ago, the more aggressive lenders such as Wachovia, Countrywide and Washington Mutual were actually reporting negative net default rates, suggesting that extending credit had no cost – in large part because the value of the collateral behind the loans was rising in value. In those heady days of comfortable collective delusions, non-current rates for 1-4 family loans were below 1%, the lowest levels of delinquency since the early 1990s.This situation changed rather dramatically by 2007, when several large west-coast non-bank mortgage lenders collapsed.  By the start of 2008, funding for banks, non-banks and even the GSEs was drying up and default rates were rising rapidly.  The cost of credit reappeared. Net-charge off rates for 1-4 family loans in particular went from 0.06% early in 2005 to 1.5% by the end of 2008 and peaked at 2.5% by the end of 2009.   Today the irrational exuberance of the Federal Open Market Committee has created huge asset price bubbles in sectors such as residential and commercial real estate.  A combination of low rates, a dearth of home builders (down 40% from ~ 550k firms in 2008 to ~ 330k firms today) and even less construction & development (C&D) lending (down ~ 30-40%) has constrained the supply of homes.  But low rates sent prices for existing homes soaring multiples of annual GDP growth – both for single-family and multifamily properties.Keep in mind that the folks on the Federal Reserve Board think that asset price inflation is helpful – thus the “wealth effect.”  Specifically, the FOMC believes that manipulating risk preferences, credit spreads and therefore asset prices helps the economy to generate more income and employment. Many analysts have debunked the notion of a “wealth effect,” but the FOMC persists in this thinking even today.  Mohamed E-Erian writing in Bloomberg has it right:“Forced to use the 'asset channel' as the main vehicle for pursuing its macroeconomic growth and inflation objectives – that is, boosting asset prices to make consumers feel wealthier and spend more, and also to increase corporate investments by fueling animal spirits – the Fed has ended up providing exceptional multiyear support to financial markets using an experimental array of unconventional tools and forward policy guidance. Indeed, most investors and traders are now conditioned to expect soothing words from central bankers – and, if needed, policy actions – the minute markets hit a rough patch, virtually regardless of the reason.”In an economic sense, the Federal Open Market Committee is the heart of the Administrative State. The use of the “asset channel” to pretend to boost economic activity is part of the larger delusion at the Fed known as “macro-prudential” policy.  The macro-prudential worldview sees the Fed as an all knowing, all-seeing global managerial agency that can somehow balance goosing economic growth using asset bubbles with preventing the associated systemic risks. Note that regulating whole industries and constraining growth is, in fact, a key part of the Fed’s macropru model.Having maintained low interest rates and used trillions of dollars of bank reserves to fund open market purchases of Treasury bonds and agency mortgage paper, the FOMC now faces an asset market that has understated the cost of credit for over a decade.  From 2001 through 2007, and then 2009 through today, the FOMC has boosted asset prices – but without a commensurate and necessary increase in income.  The Fed has, to paraphrase El-Erian, decoupled prices from fundamentals and distorted asset allocation in markets and the economy.SO the question that concerns The IRA is when will the credit cycle turn and how much of the apparently benign credit picture we see today is a function of the Fed’s social engineering?  If this latest round of Fed “ease” is more radical than that seen in the early 2000s, will we see an even sharper uptick in bank loan loss rates than we saw in 2007-2009?So how does this all end?  In the short term, look for default rates on consumer exposures to continue rising.  But in asset classes like commercial real estate, residential homes and C&D lending, we suspect that the party may continue, at least in statistical terms, through at least the end of the year.After that, however, we full expect to see loss rates and LGDs start to snap back to the middle of the proverbial distribution. As one well-placed bank CEO told The IRA over breakfast, “there are lots of sweaty palms” in the New York commercial real estate market.  Read this little missive in The New York Times about the Park Lane Hotel to get a sense of the level of exuberance in the commercial real estate market in Gotham.Without a rather robust confirmation of asset prices with rising incomes, as El_Erian and many others have observed, current levels of assets prices are unlikely to be maintained.  In the event, look for bank default and recovery rates to normalize, with a sharp increase in credit costs for lenders and bond investors alike.Trees do not grow to the sky, credit costs are never really negative, and last we looked, Fed chairs cannot fly through the air or spin straw into gold.  But they can manipulate asset prices and cause other mischief that, we suspect, represents a net cost to consumers and investors alike.  But this is hardly a novel state of affairs.In that regard, we appreciate your comments about our earlier missive, “Buy Britain, Sell Europe.” Many of you challenged our idea that Britain is an enduring nation state, while the EU is merely a bad idea whose sell by date has passed.  To address these comments, we refer to one of our favorite reads of late, “Playing Catch Up,” by Wolfgang Streeck. The emeritus director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne, Streeck writes regularly for the London Review of Books. He is ready to suspend democratic processes to support “willing governments” that advance German-style reforms, but Streeck has a cogent view of the European political economy:“Here, as so often in her long career, Merkel is anything but dogmatic, and certainly isn’t beholden to ordoliberal orthodoxy since what is at stake is Germany’s most precious historical achievement, secure access to foreign markets at a low and stable exchange rate.  For several years now, Berlin has allowed the European Central Bank under Draghi and the European Commission under Juncker to invent ever new ways of circumventing the Maastricht treaties, from financing government deficits to subsidising ailing banks. None of this has done anything to resolve the fundamental structural problems of the Eurozone. What it has done is what it was intended to do: buy time, from election to election, for European governments to carry out neoliberal reforms, and for Germany to enjoy yet another year of prosperity.”Sound familiar?  In the US as well as Europe, what passes for fiscal and monetary policy are merely a series of short-term expedients meant to get us from one day to the next.  The nonsense of macro-prudential policy represents the apex of such thinking.  As we look out to credit conditions in the US banking sector in 2H 2017 and beyond, the one sure bet is that the cost of credit will not remain suppressed forever.  








 


Mauldin - The Great Reset



		29/5/2017
	




 

by John MauldinMauldin EconomimcsMay 22, 2017The Great ResetWe are coming to a period I call the Great Reset. As it hits, we will have to deal, one way or another, with the largest twin bubbles in the history of the world: global debt, especially government debt, and the even larger bubble of government promises. We are talking about debt and unfunded promises to the tune of multiple hundreds of trillions of dollars – vastly larger than global GDP. We are also going to have to restructure our economies and in particular how we approach employment because of the massive technological transformation that is taking place. But let’s keep the focus for now on global debt and government promises.All that debt cannot be repaid under current arrangements, nor can those promises ultimately be kept. There is simply not enough money and not enough growth, and these bubbles are continuing to grow. At some point, we’re going to have to deal with these issues and restructure everything.Now, people have been saying that for years. Remember Ross Perot and his charts in the early 1990s? We’ve all heard the doom and gloom predictions of the demise of civilization that will be brought on by our Social Security and/or healthcare and/or pension problems.And yet, these are real problems we must face. Facing them won’t be the end of the world, but it will mean we must forge a different social contract and make changes to taxes and the economy. That said, the day of reckoning is not here yet. We have time to adjust and prepare. But I believe that within the next 5–10 years we have to confront the ending of the debt and government promises supercycle that has been developing since the late 1930s. This is a global problem, but it will be felt most acutely in the developed world and China. The developing and frontier markets will be radically affected as well, but mostly by fallout from the impacts on the developed world.There has been no instance in history when too much debt didn’t eventually have to be dealt with. The even more massive bubble of government promises will have to be dealt with, too. We need some realistic way to decide how to meet those promises, or at least the portion of them that can be met.For the record, what I mean by government promises are pensions and healthcare benefits in all their myriad varieties. Governments everywhere guaranteed these benefits assuming that taxes would cover their immediate costs and future politicians would figure out the rest. Now the time is rapidly approaching when those “future politicians” are the ones we elect in the here and now.What Happened to Deleveraging?Typically, after a significant recession there is a deleveraging of society. That’s certainly what many expected in 2009. Individuals in some countries did in fact reduce their debts, but not governments and corporations, or most individuals outside the US.That the world is awash in debt is not exactly news. As of 2014, total global debt had risen to $199 trillion, growing some $57 trillion in just the previous seven years, about $8 trillion a year. The McKinsey Institute chart below shows 22 advanced and 25 developing countries that make up the bulk of the world economy. The chart illustrates how the debt is split among household, corporate, government, and financial sectors:       The debt-to-GDP ratio increased in all advanced economies from 2007 through 2014, and the trend is continuing. Here’s a chart for the advanced and developing economies:       Since that 2014 report was published, global debt rose by $17 trillion through 3Q 2016. In fact, in the first nine months of 2016 global debt rose $11 trillion! After averaging a little over $8 trillion from 2007 through 2014, global debt growth is now accelerating. Global debt-to-GDP is now 325%, though it varies sharply by region and country.More worrisome is that interest rates are slowly rising pretty much everywhere, so debt-servicing costs are rising, too. In the US, according to a note sent to me recently by my friend Terry Savage, Interest on the national debt is the third largest component of our annual Federal budget – after social programs and military spending. In the most recent fiscal year, we paid $240 billion in interest on the national debt. That was a relatively low cost, because the Fed has kept interest rates artificially low for years – as savers can attest.Now, with the Fed hiking rates, interest costs are set to soar.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that every percentage point hike in rates will cost $1.6 trillion over the next ten years! And that’s without adding to the debt itself every year, by running budget deficits.That 1% rate hike will take roughly an additional 3% of our current tax revenues every year. Governments must cover higher interest costs with additional taxes, lower spending, or an increase in the deficit (which means more total debt and even more interest rate cost). Of course, higher interest rates affect more than just government interest rates. Many of us have adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans with floating interest rates.It is not just the US that faces a serious debt problem. Global GDP is roughly $80 trillion. If interest rates were to rise just 1% on our global debt, an additional $2 trillion of that GDP would go to pay that debt increase, or about 1.5% of global GDP. As we have discussed many times, debt is a limiting factor on future growth. Debt is future consumption brought forward. Repaying that debt requires either reduced future consumption or some kind of debt liquidation – those are the only choices.Debt has additional consequences. I have highlighted research from my friends Lacy Hunt and Van Hoisington that correlates increased total debt with slower overall growth. The graph below from Hoisington Investment Management shows total debt as a percentage of GDP for the major developed countries.Note that Japan, with by far the highest debt-to-GDP ratio, is growing slower than Europe, which is growing slower than the US. China’s debt is rapidly overtaking the US’s debt, and at its current growth rate it will soon overtake Europe’s. The grand Chinese debt experiment will eventually reveal the true linkage between the size of debt and growth.Unfunded LiabilitiesA Citibank report shows that the OECD countries face $78 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities. That is at least 50% more than their total GDP. Pension obligations are growing faster than GDP in most of those countries, if not all. Those are obligations on top of their total debt.By the way, most of those pension obligations are theoretically funded from future returns, which are going to be sparse to nonexistent. That means obligations are compounding significantly faster than the ability to pay them. Without serious adjustments to either benefits or funding, there is literally no hope of catching up.Thought exercise: In European countries where taxes are already more than 50% of GDP, where will they find an extra 5–10% to meet those future pension obligations? How long will younger generations tolerate carrying older generations when the government is taking two thirds of their paychecks? You can begin to see the scope of the problem.  Sometime this year, world public and private debt plus unfunded pensions will surpass $300 trillion – not counting the $100 trillion in US government unfunded liabilities. Oops.These obligations simply cannot be paid. A time is coming when the market and voters will realize that these obligations cannot be met. Will voters decide to tax “the rich” more? Will they increase their VAT rates and further slow growth? Will they reduce benefits? No matter what they decide, hard choices will bring political turmoil, which will mean market turmoil.The Unthinkable RecessionHistory shows it is more than likely that the US will have a recession in the next few years, although one doesn’t appear to be on the near horizon. But when it does come, it will likely blow the US government deficit up to $2 trillion a year. Obama took eight years to run up a $10 trillion debt after the 2008 recession. It might take just five years after the next recession to run up the next $10 trillion. Here is a chart my staff created in late 2016 using Congressional Budget Office data, showing what will happen in the next recession if revenues drop by the same percentage as they did in the last recession (without even counting likely higher expenditures this time). And you can add the $1.3 trillion deficit in this chart to the more than $500 billion in off-budget debt, plus higher interest rate expense as interest rates rise.       Whether the catalyst is a European recession that spills over into the US, or one triggered by US monetary and fiscal mistakes, or a funding crisis in China, or an emerging-market meltdown, the next recession will be just as global as the last one. And there will be more build-up of debt and more political and economic chaos.President Trump is a fairly controversial figure, but I think most of us can agree that Trump is going to make volatility great again. The Great Reset will bring an increase in volatility, and the correlation among asset classes will once again approach 1.0, as it did during 2008–2009.If I’m right about the growing debt burden, the recovery from the next recession may be even slower than the last recovery has been – unless the recession is so deep that we have a complete reset of all asset valuations. I don’t believe politicians and central banks will allow that. They will print and try to hold on as long as possible, thwarting any normal recovery, until markets force their hands.But then, I can think of at least three or four ways that politicians and central bankers could react during the Great Reset, and each will bring a different type of volatility and effects on valuations. Flexibility will be critical to successful investing in the future.

The DAO of CAPITAL: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World

As today's preeminent doomsday investor Mark Spitznagel describes his Daoist and roundabout investment approach, “one gains by losing and loses by gaining.”   This is Austrian Investing, an archetypal, counterintuitive, and proven approach, gleaned from the 150-year-old Austrian School of economics, that is both timeless and exceedingly timely.  					In The Dao of Capital, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging  pioneer Mark Spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the  financial crisis, as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping,  circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous  boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to  Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great  economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. 					 					We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian  Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive  battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the  intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming  at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental  challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal  dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring. 					Spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von  Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and—as  Spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology. From  identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market  routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive  assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel “brings  Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio.”  The Dao of Capital provides a rare and accessible look through  the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound  harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today. 								Further Reading:  The Dao of Capital Website 




The Financial Times Lexicon:  Austrian EconomicsA school of economic thought originating in Austria in the late nineteenth century which focuses on the concept of opportunity cost.  In economic theory, the term Austrian School stands for liberalism and laissez-faire-economics (where economic performance is optimised when there is limited government interference).The Austrian School of economics has its original roots in the work of Carl Menger from the University of Vienna . References to the topic were first published in 1871. Well-known followers of Menger included Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk (1851 – 1914), Ludwig von Mises (1881 – 1973) and, perhaps most important, Friedrich A. Hayek (1899 – 1929).Hayek, for example, strongly rejected any intervention by the state in the economy. For him, markets work perfectly in the sense that the market price balances supply and demand.  A perfect market is one characterised by easy access to information, no barriers to entry and with prices controlled by all participants.Due to the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, the popularity of the Austrian School of economics has experienced a boost in recent times because it had predicted, a long time ago, that too much debt – due to too low interest rates – would trigger investment bubbles followed by a crisis after these bubbles burst.  For example, look at Ireland’s property bubble, which was fuelled by reckless lending by banks to property developers.In contrast to Keynesianism, the Austrian School of thought holds that the business cycle is driven by the supply side of the economy, not demand. If interest rates are too low, we will have over-investment. This may lead to over-production, which may trigger a crisis. During the crisis, supply declines until it is once again equal to overall demand. Then a new cycle starts.For the Austrian school, the main challenge is not inflation, but over-investment in the face of too much money, or too-low interest rates that can lead to a crisis.  Too much money means that the growth of money supply is much higher than the growth of goods and services in an economy. This leads to inflation, which is an increase in the average prices of all goods because there is more money available.This means that the right level of the interest rate, called the ‘natural rate of interest’, is crucial to prevent a crisis. This type of interest rate attracts enough investment to ensure full employment and no inflation. If the actual rate is equal to the natural rate, there is no inflation.Further reading:  Ludwig von Mises Institute | Austrian School

Important notice to Superfund Green products: There is a substantial risk of loss in trading futures and options. Drawdowns may occur due to market conditions and may range approximately from 20% to 30% from the respective all-time-high of Green strategy A, from 30% to 40% of the respective all–time high of Green strategy B and from 40% to 50% of the respective all–time high of Green strategy C. Decreases in value exceeding these figures are also possible at anytime, and the possibility of a complete loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded.

Important Notice to Superfund Red, Superfund Red Gold and Superfund Red Silver: There is a substantial risk of loss in trading futures and options. Drawdowns may occur regularly due to market conditions and may range approximately from 30% to 50% from the respective all-time-high. Decreases in value exceeding these figures are also possible at anytime, and the possibility of a complete loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded. Superfund Red USD, Superfund Red Gold and Superfund Red Silver are traded in USD. Fluctuations in the USD/EUR exchange rate may substantially decrease the net asset value.

Special Risk Considerations for Investments in Superfund Blue
	Superfund Blue SPC Class A (EUR) and Class A (Gold) may not involve the direct purchase and sale of equity securities, but rather may trade synthetically through total return swaps on such securities utilizing a leverage of up to four times of the funds assets. Swap investments through a prime broker bear the issuer risk of the respective broker. Drawdowns may occur regularly due to market conditions and may range approximately from 10% to 15% from the respective all-time-high. Decreases in value exceeding these figures are also possible at anytime, and the possibility of a complete loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded.

Special Risk Considerations for Investments in Superfund Green/Blue Gold: In addition to the trading results of the respective Superfund trading strategy, the value of shares of Superfund Green/Blue Gold will be directly affected by movements in the U.S. dollar price of gold. DEPRECIATION OF THE GOLD PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND GREEN/Blue GOLD. If general trading restrictions of the offering documents make it impossible to fully hedge the assets of Superfund Green/Blue Gold against the gold price, then the gold hedge position will be held as close as possible to the desired full hedge, without blocking assets that are necessary for the generally applied Superfund trading strategy, which will always retain priority within the trading process. NO GUARANTEE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PROCEEDS OF SUPERFUND GREEN/BLUE GOLD ARE ALWAYS FULLY HEDGED TO THE CURRENT GOLD PRICE. Since the price of gold may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, Superfund Green/Blue Gold may be more volatile than other types of investments.

	A decrease in the USD price of futures and forwards linked to gold, due to these risk factors or other potential factors that may directly affect the price of gold, will have a direct effect on the NAV of Superfund Green/Blue Gold.

Special Risk Considerations for Investments in Superfund Red Gold/Silver: In addition to the trading results of the Superfund Red trading strategy, the value of shares of Superfund Red Gold/Silver will be directly affected by movements in the U.S. dollar price of gold or silver. DEPRECIATION OF THE GOLD/SILVER PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND RED GOLD/SILVER. If general trading restrictions of the offering documents make it impossible to fully hedge the assets of Superfund Red Gold/Silver against the gold/silver price, then the gold/silver hedge position will be held as close as possible to the desired full hedge, without blocking assets that are necessary for the generally applied Superfund Red trading strategy, which will always retain priority within the trading process. NO GUARANTEE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PROCEEDS OF SUPERFUND RED GOLD/SILVER ARE ALWAYS FULLY HEDGED TO THE CURRENT GOLD/SILVER PRICE. Since the price of gold/silver may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, Superfund Red Gold/Silver may be more volatile than other types of investments. A decrease in the USD price of futures and forwards linked to gold/silver, due to these risk factors or other potential factors that may directly affect the price of gold/silver, will have a direct effect on the NAV of Superfund Red Gold/Silver.

	DEPRECIATION OF THE GOLD PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND RED GOLD. DEPRECIATION OF THE SILVER PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND RED SILVER.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING SIMULATED PERFORMANCE FOR SUPERFUND RED:

	The simulated performance results for Superfund Red are provided for informational purposes only to indicate historical performance had a comparable Superfund product strategy been available over the relevant period. No representation is being made that any investment in Superfund Red EUR, USD, Gold or Silver will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. Past and simulated performance is not indicative of future results. Although the simulation includes adjustments for certain fees payable by the new strategies, the simulated performance results may vary once actual fees are taken into account. Your attention is specifically drawn to the fact that the simulated performance of Superfund Red, Red Gold and Red Silver is based in USD and on the price of gold and silver based in USD and that fluctuations during this time in the USD/EUR exchange rate have not been considered or included in the simulated performance. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any investment will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular fund.

	There is no single entity or legal body that constitutes the “Superfund Group”. Rather, the Superfund group of investment companies is a consortium of affiliated entities that collectively provide the management, trading advisory, sales and marketing services for the managed futures funds which utilize the same Superfund brand systematic trend-following strategy. Absent valid express written authorization by the company to be bound, no entity within the Superfund group of investment companies shall be liable or incur responsibility for any act or omission of any other entity within the Superfund group of investment companies.

	SUPERFUND MARKETING & SPORT SPONSORING, INC. CREATED THIS WEBSITE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY INACCURACIES CONTAINED IN THIS WEBSITE, AND SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE SAME.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.

An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
