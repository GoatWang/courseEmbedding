William R. "Bill" Hambrecht (born 1935) is an American investment banker and chairman of WR Hambrecht + Co which he founded in 1998. He helped persuade Google to use an Internet-based auction for their initial public offering (IPO) in 2004, instead of a more traditional method using banks and other financial companies to find buyers. He is credited with popularizing this "OpenIPO" model, using Dutch auctions to allow anyone, not just investing insiders, to buy stock in an IPO, potentially raising more money for startups. Some of the companies he has helped have an IPO like this include Overstock.com, Ravenswood Winery, Andover.net and Salon.com.[1][2]
Hambrecht is also credited as one of the first major investors to recognize the value of technology and biotech companies, helping to take Apple Computer, Genentech and Adobe Systems public in the 1980s with his earlier San Francisco-based company Hambrecht & Quist, which he founded in 1968 and which also backed the IPOs of Netscape, MP3.com, and Amazon.com. The firm was bought by Chase Manhattan in 1999.[3] In 1997, he sponsored the foundation of BOOM Securities (H.K.) Limited.[4]
Hambrect is a 1957 graduate of Princeton University, where he received an A.B. in History. He has been listed as one of the top political donors in the country, giving mostly to Democratic candidates, and credits Nancy Pelosi, whom he met in the 1970s, with inspiring him to get involved in politics.[5]
Hambrecht is on the Board of Trustees of the American University of Beirut,[6] Lebanon.[7] He was on the Motorola Board of Directors from 2008–2011 and the AOL Inc. Board of Directors from December 2010 to February 2011.[8]
Professional football[edit]
In the 1980s Hambrecht was a minority investor in the Oakland Invaders, a charter member of the failed United States Football League.[2]
In 2007 Hambrect was again in the news for planning a professional football league, the United Football League. Along with AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, Hambrecht pledged $2 million to start the league up and arranged its original owners. On August 11, 2009, Hambrecht stepped forward to be the owner of the Las Vegas Locomotives franchise. The league remains under his overall leadership and direction.[9] The William Hambrecht Trophy, awarded to the winner of the UFL Championship Game, is named in his honor. Hambrecht was sued in the spring of 2013 for payment due 138 players and former coaches who did not receive their 2012 salaries. He lost the case in Las Vegas courts.

About WR Hambrecht + Co


We help companies of all sizes efficiently access capital at the lowest possible cost in order to accelerate disruptive growth.
WR Hambrecht + Co was founded in January 1998 to level the playing field for investors and our corporate clients. Our Founder, Bill Hambrecht, is a Silicon Valley pioneer who has been financing growth companies from Apple to Google during his time at Hambrecht & Quist and WRH+Co. The firm’s impartial auctions have dramatically changed the traditional investment banking landscape by allowing the market itself to determine pricing and allocations.
Throughout our history, WRH+Co has been an innovative leader with a core philosophy based on three tenets:

identifying exceptional companies
helping them raise capital and go public early
delivering efficient market pricing

Our current innovation initiatives include applying Data Science and Disruption Theory analytics to better understand companies and industries at all stages.
WR Hambrecht + Co is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York.
Capital Raising
Our investment banking business aims to serve uncommon companies with compelling growth opportunities, including those that traditional investment banks deem “too small” to go public. It has long been our conviction that access to public capital enables growth companies to focus on innovation while providing an opportunity for all classes of investors to participate in their success.
To accomplish this, we have created products like the OpenIPO® Auction, influenced regulation change, and worked toward the creation of an open IPO marketplace.
The OpenIPO® auction, for example, levels the playing field in initial public offerings, allowing individuals and institutional investors to bid online for shares of an IPO. All investors end up paying the same price — a price determined by the auction.
Under new provisions of the 2012 JOBS Act, we have been a pioneer and advocate for the distribution of independent pre-IPO research to all investors. Further, Bill and our firm were cited 29 times in the SEC’s proposed rulemaking for Regulation A+. We believe this proposed expansion of the Regulation A exemption would create a new option for early-stage growth companies to access public markets through the A+ IPO.
We leverage the Internet for efficient marketing and allocation of product, as opposed to the expensive sales and marketing infrastructure of the traditional investment bank. Based on our decades of experience taking companies public, we envision an accessible marketplace for initial public offerings where the investment bank serves as a facilitator between issuers and investors, instead of a gatekeeper. The market itself can and should determine pricing and allocation — our role is to provide a platform where qualified growth companies can tell their story to potential investors.
Our Products
The OpenIPO® Auction
A simpler way to efficient and transparent IPO price discovery.Available technology enables the distribution of issuer disclosure and research to any investor, and the collection of bids in a fair and systematic fashion. To learn more, click here.
The A+ IPO
Proposed Regulation A Tier 2 changes would provide growth companies streamlined access to public capital, enabling them to focus on innovation while providing an opportunity for all classes of investors to participate in their success. We intend to be at the forefront of the A+ IPO marketplace as it evolves. To learn more, click here.
The OpenBook® Auction
An online system that offers transparent, real-time price discovery for corporate bonds.
The OpenFollowOn® Auction
Extends the transparency and real-time price discovery of the OpenBook auction to follow-on equity offerings allowing interactive bidding and gives investors a view into the book as it builds.
Venture Capital and Applied Disruption Theory
Disruption Theory, as articulated by Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen in his landmark work The Innovator’s Dilemma (1997), is at the core of our firm’s strategy. In addition to traditional fundamental analysis, we use predictive data science tools to better understand companies and industries through the lens of Disruption Theory. These tools were developed out of a breakthrough research collaboration in 2007-2008 between Thomas Thurston, then at Intel Capital, and Professor Christensen.
This innovative, unique approach to venture capital investing enables us to identify the truly disruptive companies with greater probability of long term business viability. Our algorithmic approach stands out in an industry where subjective decision-making remains the status quo.
An Open Conversation
WR Hambrecht + Co continues to identify markets where auctions will benefit investors and issuers. We provide underwriting and advisory services for technology and emerging growth companies.
We are passionate about businesses and value the opportunity to talk to entrepreneurs. If you are interested in learning more about the proposed framework for A+ IPOs, or any of our auction-based products, we would be happy to share our insights. Just get in touch.

Hambrecht, William R. - The Wall Street Transcript













































 





































William R. Hambrecht
WILLIAM R. HAMBRECHT is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
WR Hambrecht + Co, a financial services firm headquartered in San
Francisco that he founded in January 1998. Mr. Hambrecht resigned
in December 1997 as Chairman of Hambrecht & Quist, the investment
banking firm he co-founded with the late George Quist in 1968.
Using impartial Internet-based auctions that allow the market to
determine pricing and allocation, WR Hambrecht + Co is
dramatically changing the financial services landscape. WR
Hambrecht + Co currently has 125 employees and offices in New
York, Boston and Philadelphia. Excluding a tour of duty in the
military, Mr. Hambrecht has been in the investment banking and
brokerage business since graduating from Princeton University in
1957. He began his business career in underwriting and sales with
Securities Associates, Inc., a securities firm in Winter Park,
Florida. In 1961 Securities Associates was acquired by AC Allyn &
Co., which eventually became a part of F.I. du Pont & Co. In
1965, Mr. Hambrecht managed the San Francisco office for F. I. du
Pont, becoming Vice President and Manager of its West Coast
Corporate Finance operation in 1967. It was through his corporate
finance activities that he met George Quist who was the head of
small business lending at Bank of America. Both men perceived a
demand for a strong regional investment bank based in San
Francisco that could offer a high level of service to the small,
rapidly growing companies in nearby Silicon Valley. In the early
1970s he became directly involved in the then fledgling venture
capital business as a result of H&Q’s investment banking
expertise and network of clients. This was an obvious extension
of its existing business, since many investment banking clients
required both capital and strategic assistance prior to becoming
publicly listed. Mr. Hambrecht currently serves as Director for
numerous private companies, including KQED, Inc., San Francisco’s
public radio and television station. He is also in the wine
business. In addition to owning over 500 acres of vineyards on
over 1,000 acres of land in Sonoma County, Hambrecht Wine Group
owns Belvedere Winery in Healdsburg.

Hambrecht & Quist sold


David Armstrong, OF THE EXAMINER STAFF


        Published 4:00 am, Tuesday, September 28, 1999
    
































































1999-09-28 04:00:00 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- Chase Manhattan Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay $1.35 billion cash for Hambrecht & Quist Inc., the San Francisco investment bank that has driven many of the technology sector deals of recent years. 
Under terms of the deal, announced Tuesday, H&Q, which has 850 employees, will assume the Chase name and continue to be based in San Francisco. The 30-year-old firm will become part of Chase Securities' investment-banking arm. 
"Chase is a big believer in thee new economy,." Chase vice chairman Marc Shapiro told The Examiner. "This will enable us to participate in the convergence of the Internet, telecom and other new technologies. 



Latest news videos




 
"The real juice in these deals is selling the product line of one customer to another. 
"We will offer this expanded line under the Chase name, so that there is no confusion among customers. We are all on the same team." 
Hambrecht & Quist is the largest independent investment bank in Northern California, underwriting more than 650 initial public offerings since its inception in 1968, including Apple Computer Inc. and amazon.com.

Hambrecht & Quist has benefited from the firm's association with technology companies and investor enthusiasm for Internet-related businesses. 

Stock has tripled&lt;
Its stock has more than tripled in the last year, compared with a 66 percent gain for Chase and a 90 percent rise in the American Stock Exchange index of securities firms. 
During the third quarter, H&Q has underwritten $461 million in initial public offerings, placing the firm 10th among investment banks with a 3.6 percent market share, according to Securities Data Co. 
Chase, the industry's largest corporate lender, was seeking to add equity underwriting to its investment-banking services, which include junk-bond sales and merger advice. 
H&Q had been given a lead in the Internet field by being one of the first venture capital firms to invest in Netscape Communications, which created the popular Web browser. 
The sale of H&Q, which Chase's Shapiro said is expected to close by the end of the year, will give Chase - the second-largest U.S. bank - the stock underwriting business it has long sought. 
"It adds another arrow to the quiver of their services," said Stephen Berman, senior equity analyst at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., which owns about 800,000 Chase shares. 
Investors had speculated Chase would merge with a Wall Street investment bank such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. or Merrill Lynch & Co. 

Extends Chase's range of products&lt;
The purchase of Hambrecht & Quist will extend Chase's 
"investment banking range of products in the highest growth sector of the U.S. economy, where media, telecommunications, information technology and the Internet converge," William Harrison Jr., Chase's chief executive, said in a statement. 
Some of the cross-country combinations of commercial and investment banks have led to departures of top management. 
About a year after selling San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities to NationsBank for $1.2 billion, Thomas Weisel, the firm's founder, left after a dispute over control of the junk-bond business. Weisel started his own company and took former Montgomery executives with him. 
A combination with Merrill Lynch would have put Chase in a much higher league. Merrill underwrote $835 million in IPOs around the world in the third quarter to Sept. 27, almost twice that underwritten by H&Q. Merrill is also the world's biggest underwriter of debt, with its total debt and equity underwriting in the quarter about $63 billion. 
"I strongly suspect that they did this because they had run through the alternatives," said Carla D'Arista, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. "They're unlikely to do anything else for at least a year. It's a nice fit." 
H&Q was founded by William R. Hambrecht and George Quist, who died in 1982. The firm went public in 1996. The current chairman, Daniel Case, 41, is the older brother of America Online chief executive Steve Case. 
Hambrecht, 63, left the firm in 1998 to start a new firm, W.R. Hambrecht & Co., which uses the Internet to raise money for small companies, in part by auctioning shares directly to the public. 
New York-based Chase will pay $50 a share for San Francisco-based Hambrecht & Quist, 22 percent more than Monday's closing price of $41.06. Chase will also set aside $200 million in stock to retain key Hambrecht & Quist bankers. H&Q shares rose $7.69 to 48.75 in morning trading; Chase fell 1 to 73.13.&lt;

William R. Hambrecht— Outside Business Activity


                    Posted May 6, 2016 by Alan Rosca

William R. Hambrecht Allegedly Failed to Disclose Eight Unsatisfied Judgments in a Timely Fashion Relating to Outside Businesses Totaling Approximately $22.5 Million
William R. Hambrecht allegedly willfully failed to amend his Form U4 in order to timely disclose eight unsatisfied judgments, according to a recent FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (AWC).
Said judgments relate to outside businesses totaling approximately $22.5 million, which were entered against him between April 2012 and August 2013, the aforementioned AWC also notes.
William R. Hambrecht Suspended and Fined $15,000 by FINRA for Allegedly Failing to Disclose Eight Unsatisfied Judgments
William R. Hambrecht, who first entered first became registered with FINRA in May 1968, allegedly failed to disclose his outside business activity when answering the question on his Form U4 which asks: Do you have any unsatisfied judgments or liens against you?”, according to the AWC.
William R. Hambrecht, who, from July 1998 to March 2016, was registered through W.R. Hambrecht & Co., allegedly did not disclose said judgments on his Form U4 until either April 2014 or July 2014, the AWC notes.
