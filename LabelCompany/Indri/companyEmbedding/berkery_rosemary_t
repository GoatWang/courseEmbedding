Fluor Adds Rosemary T. Berkery and H. Paulett Eberhart to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































Fluor Adds Rosemary T. Berkery and H. Paulett Eberhart to Board of 
      Directors






June 24, 2010 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) announced today the election of Rosemary 
      T. Berkery and H. Paulett Eberhart to its Board of Directors. With these 
      new additions, Fluor’s board increases from 10 to 12 members, with 11 
      being independent directors.
    


      Berkery is presently vice chairman of UBS Wealth Management Americas and 
      chairman of UBS Bank USA. Eberhart is currently chairman and chief 
      executive officer of HMS Ventures, a privately held business involved 
      with real estate and consulting services.
    

      “Rosemary and Paulett are both welcome additions to our board and bring 
      with them respectively legal and financial expertise coupled with keen 
      understanding of complex business operations,” said Alan Boeckmann, 
      Fluor’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Each of them will provide 
      valuable and unique insights to our board discussions and 
      decision-making processes, and we are pleased with their selection.”
    

      Prior to her current position, Berkery served Merrill Lynch’s Board of 
      Directors and its executive management team as vice chairman, executive 
      vice president and general counsel for nearly a decade of her 25-year 
      career. She serves on the Board of Trustees of the School of American 
      Ballet, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Fordham 
      University and the College of Mount Saint Vincent.
    

      Berkery earned a J.D. from St. John’s University Law School where she 
      also served as an editor of the university’s distinguished Law Review. 
      She holds a bachelor’s degree from the College of Mount Saint Vincent in 
      Riverdale, N.Y.
    

      Eberhart was previously president and CEO of Invensys Process Systems in 
      Plano, Texas, where she transformed the $1.5 billion company from a 
      product-focused business to an integrated solutions provider. She 
      previously served as Electronic Data Systems Corporation’s (EDS) 
      president for the Americas where she led EDS’s largest operating unit 
      with annual revenues of $8.5 billion. During her 26-year career with 
      EDS, Eberhart held numerous executive financial and operating roles. EDS 
      is now an HP company.
    

      Eberhart sits on the Board of Directors for Anadarko Petroleum, an 
      energy exploration and production company, as well as for Advanced Micro 
      Devices where she serves as the chair for its compensation committee. 
      She previously served on the boards of A.T. Kearney and Solectron 
      Corporation. Eberhart is a graduate of Bowling Green State University in 
      Ohio where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business 
      administration and is a Certified Public Accountant.
