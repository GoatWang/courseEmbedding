Better Cost Containment
We bring you  buying power, coordination among the trades, scope gap elimination and reduced paperwork that all work together; driving down total project cost and keeping your margins healthy









Other Services
Atlas is a true “solutions provider”. Our depth of experience enables us to provide our clients with solutions to their construction challenges that mere distributors cannot offer. 


Estimating & Engineering
At Atlas, we strive to set the standard.  We have a full team of estimators ready and able to take on even the most challenging of projects.  With over 35 years of experience estimating in the construction industry, we are comfortable taking off any job, although our specialties lie within K-12 Education, Healthcare, and Government work. We are capable of providing pre-construction budgeting as well as pricing for complete on-site installation.


Project Management
Atlas believes in not only providing the material to the jobsite, but in seeing the project through to the very end.  With a project management staff of nearly 20 employees, we work tirelessly until the project is complete and every member of the team is satisfied with the end result.  Our project management team is trained and confident in handling even the most complex projects.  Let us show you what we can do for you!


Installation Services
On-site, we provide supervision and installation to provide true turnkey solutions. Off-site, we prep and install hardware to provide rapid installation once the product is delivered to the job. Let us help you explore cost-saving alternatives for your project. This is a valuable service for contractors and building owners, who have for years depended on us for the highest quality materials. You can rest assured that products will be properly installed on a timely basis without having to worry about finding the manpower.





Recent Projects
Over the years, we have been an integral part of thousands of construction projects. Here, we are pleased to present a few of the notable projects we have worked on recently which demonstrate our capabilities. Should you have questions or want more in-depth information on our resume, please feel free to contact us.

A Little Bit More About Atlas…





About Us
Atlas has been serving the construction industry since 1972. We are a full-service solution provider. Working on projects from "cradle to grave", we have the expertise to facilitate providing the materials, installation, and coordination to see the successful completion of your project. We are adept at providing turnkey solutions that meet the most exacting standards. 

We utilize a team concept, assigning  a single point of contact to work with you throughout the process.


BACKGROUND
Atlas was formed in 1972. From a humble beginning in a small home off the Outer Loop in Louisville, KY, the Atlas Companies have expanded to multiple locations including offices in Lexington, KY, Indianapolis, IN, and Gonzales, LA. Our main headquarters location is at 5101 Commerce Crossing Drive in Louisville, KY.  This growth was fostered by founder JC Keith’s determination to build a company based on the principles of integrity, dependability, proactivity, excellence, and tenacity.
 
Atlas has built a reputation for providing the highest quality materials to the commercial construction industry.  From our base business of supplying hollow metal doors and frames, Atlas has expanded to include a broad spectrum of products, all backed by professional, courteous service.  This has allowed Atlas to “set the standard” that other distributors in the market are compared to.
 
Atlas is an enduring presence that will remain strong for years to come. We maintain historical records of our projects, so we can quickly find matching material to assist in expansions and remodels throughout the life of the structure.  When other distributors come and go, we continue to provide consistent quality and dependable service that you can rely on.
 
VALUES
INTEGRITY — dealing with everyone in an honest, ethical, and irreproachable manner
DEPENDABILITY — being accountable to others and accepting responsibility for ourselves
PROACTIVITY — anticipating and instigating positive outcomes
EXCELLENCE — continuously improving our proficiencies
TENACITY — persistently pursuing win-win solutions
