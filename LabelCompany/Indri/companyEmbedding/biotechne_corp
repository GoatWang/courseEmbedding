					Full Description



Bio-Techne Corporation, incorporated on July 17, 1981, develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology reagents and instruments for the research and clinical diagnostic markets. The Company operates through three segments: Biotechnology, Clinical Controls and Protein Platforms. The Biotechnology segment develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products across the world. The Clinical Controls segment develops and manufactures controls, calibrators, immunoassays and other reagents for the global clinical market. The Protein Platforms segment develops and commercializes systems and consumables for protein analysis.Biotechnology SegmentThe Biotechnology segment supplies specialized proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors, immunoassays, antibodies and related reagents, to the biotechnology research community. It develops and manufactures a range of cytokines, growth factors and enzymes, extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant de-oxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) technology. The Company produces polyclonal antibodies in animals (primarily goats, sheep and rabbits), purifying them from the animals' blood. It derives monoclonal antibodies from immortalized rodent cell lines using hybridoma technology, isolating them from cell culture medium, or it manufactures them through recombinant DNA technology. The flow cytometry product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits that are used to determine the immuno-phenotypic properties of cells from different tissues.The Company markets a range of immunoassays on different testing platforms, including microtiter-plate based kits sold under the trade name Quantikine, multiplex immunoassays based on encoded bead technology and immunoassays based on planar spotted surfaces and microfluidic-based multiplex immunoassays on automated testing platform. The Company's small molecule chemically-based products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists, antagonists and/or inhibitors of various biological functions. The Company sells its biotechnology products directly to customers located in North America, western Europe and China. It also sells through third party distributors in China, Japan, southern and eastern Europe, and the rest of the world.The Company competes with GE Healthcare Life Sciences, BD Biosciences, Merck KGaA/EMD Chemicals, Inc., PeproTech, Inc., Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Abcam plc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Cayman Chemical Company and Enzo Biochem, Inc.Clinical Controls SegmentThe Company derives its hematology controls and calibrators from various cellular components of blood, which have been stabilized. The Company also offers clinical controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices, as well as coagulation device control products. In addition, the Company also develops and supplies bulk purified proteins, enzymes, disease-state plasmas, infectious disease antigens and processed serums to the clinical diagnostic industry across the world. The Company supplies these reagents in various formats, including liquid, lyophilized and powder form.The Company competes with Abbott Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Streck, Inc., Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Sysmex Corporation, SeraCare Life Sciences, Inc., HyTest Ltd and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.Protein Platforms SegmentThe Company offers Simple Western platform and SimplePlex Platform. Simple Western platform is an automated Western blot analytical technique, which identifies and quantifies a protein of interest in a sample. The Simple Western product lines transform the Western into a real protein analytical tool. SimplePlex Platform is a common assay used in research and clinical diagnostics is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The SimplePlex platform is a transformative immunoassay technology, which integrates microfluidic cartridge with an analyzer to deliver an immunoassay system. SimplePlex assays are automated, multi-analyte immunoassays that permit the customer to run multiple samples while interrogating multiple analytes in approximately one hour. The Company's Biologics tools provide the researchers to interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics.The Company's iCE3 system is an analytical tool that measures the charge heterogeneity of proteins. Its micro-flow imaging (MFI) platform measures the size, shape, count and concentration of particles that may be present in biologic solutions. The Company also offers a biologics product, Maurice, which profiles identity, purity and hetergenity of biopharmaceuticals in one system. In addition, the Company offers Single Cell Western Platform, which performs western blot assays on individual cells versus an entire cell population. The Company sells protein platforms products directly to customers located in North America, western Europe and Japan. It also sells through third party distributors in China, southern Europe and the rest of the world.The Company competes with Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., GE Healthcare, Merck KGaA, PerkinElmer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Meso Scale Discovery, Luminex, Millipore, MDS Analytical Technologies, Tecan BioTek, Agilent Technologies, Danaher, Shimadzu and Waters.

Beginning in 2013, the company's chief executive officer was Chuck Kummeth, who had previously been employed by Thermo Fisher Scientific.[2]

Bio-Techne Corporation is a holding company for biotechnology and clinical diagnostic brands. It was founded in 1976 as Techne Corporation and changed its name to Bio-Techne in 2014.[2] The company's brands include flagship R&D Systems (Research and Diagnostic Systems Inc.),[3] Boston Biochem, Tocris Bioscience, BiosPacific and Bionostics.[2] The company's products are used in both clinical and research contexts.[4][5] The company was co-founded as a "hematology controls developer"[2] by Dr. Roger C. Lucas, who presently serves as its Chief Scientific Advisor.[6]
Bio-Techne is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol TECH.[7] Writing for Forbes from an investor's perspective, John Reese praised the management team saying it "...appears to be doing a solid job...",[8] a sentiment echoed by Philip van Doorn, writing for Dow Jones MarketWatch.[9] Interviewing investor Edward B. White for the New York Times, Carole Gould noted that White thought the chief executive, Thomas Oland, was a "deeply committed scientist."[10]
Beginning in 2013, the company's chief executive officer was Chuck Kummeth, who had previously been employed by Thermo Fisher Scientific.[2]
