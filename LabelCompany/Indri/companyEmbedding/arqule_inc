				ARQ 092			





Home   /   Pipeline   /   ARQ 092 Overview
ARQ 092 is an investigational orally available, selective, pan-AKT inhibitor that potently inhibits AKT1, 2 and 3 isoforms. The drug is currently in phase 1b for oncology and phase 1 for Proteus syndrome, a rare over-growth disease, in a trial being conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Both trials are biomarker-driven and are focused on enrolling patients with the AKT1 mutation. We plan to initiate a company sponsored Phase 1/2 trial in Overgrowth Diseases, including PROS (PIK3CA Rare Overgrowth Syndromes) and Proteus syndrome, in Q2 of 2017.
ARQ 092 has demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth and downstream AKT signaling, in vivo, in tumors whose growth is driven by these targets. Single agent activity with ARQ 092 was observed in phase 1a and phase 1b studies as well as reductions in expression levels of relevant biomarkers. Publications support AKT1 as a viable target in oncology and Proteus syndrome.
Mechanism of Action
ARQ 092 suppresses the AKT pathway via two modes of action. First, by binding to the inactive form of AKT, ARQ 092 prevents membrane localization and full AKT activation. Second, ARQ 092 also directly inhibits the membrane associated active form of AKT.
Precision Medicine
The AKT1 mutation is believed to play a role in a number of cancers and over-growth diseases, such as Proteus syndrome and Overgrowth syndromes similar to PROS.
The AKT pathway when abnormally activated is implicated in multiple oncogenic processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis.  This pathway has emerged as a target of potential therapeutic relevance for compounds that inhibit its activity, which has been linked to a variety of cancers as well as to select non-oncology indications. Pre-clinical research has demonstrated that ARQ 092 potently and selectively inhibits both the active and inactive forms of AKT.
A landmark discovery by researchers from the National Human Genome Research Institute demonstrated that a somatic mutation in the AKT1 oncogene, which carries the set of instructions to produce the AKT1 kinase, causes Proteus syndrome. A point mutation – a single-letter “misspelling” in the DNA of the genetic code — in the AKT1 gene activates the tissue growth characteristic of Proteus syndrome.
Diseases We Are Exploring in Clinical Trials
Rare Diseases

Proteus syndrome
Patients with Proteus syndrome experience changes in the shapes of certain body structures over time, including abnormal, often asymmetric, massive growth (overgrowth) of the skeleton, skin, adipose tissue and central nervous system out of proportion to the rest of the body which may appear normal. Although patients may have minimal or no manifestations at birth, the disease develops and becomes apparent in early childhood (6-18 months) and rapidly progresses with intense growth in the first 10 years of life. The worldwide incidence is believed to be less than one in a million.
Overgrowth Diseases
Overgrowth Disease is a term used to refer to a spectrum of rare diseases identified by somatic mutations, often of the PI3K or AKT1 pathway, that result in excess growth in certain areas of the body. While the individual diseases that fall within the overgrowth spectrum have similar symptoms, each disease is defined by unique characteristics. Diseases that are part of the overgrowth spectrum include PROS diseases (PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum) and Proteus syndrome. Each disease on its own is rare, sometimes ultra-rare, often only impacting an estimated one in a million people worldwide.As an example, CLOVES (Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth, Vascular malformations, Epidermal nevi, Spinal/Skeletal Anomalies and/or Scoliosis) is a disease that is part of the PROS family of diseases. According to the CLOVES Foundation (www.clovesfoundation.org), CLOVES is an extremely rare progressive overgrowth disorder, affecting approximately 200 people worldwide. The symptoms vary from mild soft tissue tumors to Vascular Malformations encompassing the spine or internal organs. CLOVES Syndrome is closely linked to other overgrowth disorders like M-CM (Macrocephaly-Capillary Malformation) Syndrome, Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber Syndrome, and Proteus Syndrome.

Oncology


AKT1 Driven Cancers 
Prevalence of AKT1 mutations in cancer varies from 1-6% depending on tumor types. The tumor types with the highest prevalence of AKT1 mutations are breast, bladder, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers.


Current Clinical Trials


Phase 1/2 in Overgrowth Diseases with genetic alterations of the PI3K/AKT1 pathway
This phase 1/2 trial is scheduled to begin dosing in Q2’17.

More info: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02594215?cond=%22Proteus+syndrome%22&rank=1
Identifier on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02594215


Phase 1b in Oncology – Single Agent
This phase 1b trial is enrolling in the U.S. as a single agent in patients with lymphoma, endometrial cancer and AKT1 E17K mutations.
More info: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01473095?term=arqule&rank=4
Identifier on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01473095


Phase 1b in Oncology – Combination

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
