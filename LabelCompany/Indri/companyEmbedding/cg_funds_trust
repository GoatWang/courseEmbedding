Wall Street Management Corporation ("WSMC"), an SEC registered investment adviser headquartered in New York City, founded in 1954, focuses on a balanced management investment strategy for clients and serves as the Adviser to the CG Core Balanced Fund ("Fund"), formed under the CG Funds Trust. WSMC has a Management Services Agreement with Morse Asset Management, Inc. ("MAM") also located in New York City to assist in the day-to-day operation of the Fund.

A number of the individuals have MBA degrees. Prior to Evercore Wealth Management they worked at the investment advisory firm of Morse, Williams & Co., Inc. and its affiliate, Wall Street Management Corporation.
The Fund's primary investment objective is to produce growth of capital, with a secondary objective of current income through the receipt of interest and dividends. It will invest in equity and fixed income securities of companies of any size, but generally companies that have been in business for at least three years and demonstrate positive growth characteristics. Fixed income investments will consist of investment grade securities and dividend-paying stocks.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.

More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services.

Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.

These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.

If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Mutual Fund
 
Mutual fund is an investment product in the form of collective investment scheme into which funds of investors are pooled and managed by an asset management company which is licensed by the SEC to undertake investment management business. A mutual fund is a juristic person separate from the responsible asset management company.      
 
As the investing public’s interest is at stake, establishment and management of mutual funds are subject to the SEC regulations to ensure that they are managed appropriately by professionals in accordance with the objectives of the fund schemes. 
 
The SEC’s criteria for approving a mutual fund includes clarity and regulatory compliance of the investment policy, disclosure of risks and returns, disclosure of redemption rights including the right to dividends (if any), the right to transfer investment units and the right to cast a vote on proposed change to the scheme, etc.    
 
After an approval for establishing a mutual fund is granted, the initial public offering cannot commence until the asset management company appoints an independent third-party as fund supervisor to guard the assets of the fund and ensure that the investment complies with the fund scheme. 
 
Upon completion of the initial public offering, the proceeds must be registered as a mutual fund thus becoming a juristic person separate from the asset management company. In the possible event of bankruptcy of the asset management company, the asset segregation will prevent the creditors’ claim for right in the fund’s assets. Any retail fund must have at least 35 unitholders.
 
In managing a mutual fund, the asset management company must comply with the governing rules and the investment policy specified in the prospectus. The investment policy must be risk diverse in terms of asset, industrial sector and company and in line with investment restrictions, if any. 
 
A fund manager is assigned by the asset management company to make investment decisions in line with the investment objectives and policy specified in the scheme. Prior to performing such role, the fund manager must obtain an approval from the SEC whose criteria include levels of relevant knowledge and work experience, professional codes of conduct and possession of prohibited characteristics. 
 
In addition, a fund supervisor must be appointed to perform fiduciary duties and act for the best interest of the unitholders. This includes ensuring that the investment is in accordance with the fund scheme, reviewing the calculation of the net asset value (NAV), safekeeping and registration of fund assets, taking a legal action against the asset management company’s misconduct on behalf of the unitholders, and appointing an SEC-approved auditor to audit the financial statements of the fund. 
 
The asset management company must regularly calculate and disclose the NAV based on the market price as well as prepare the half-year and annual financial statements in compliance with the accounting standards and disclose them completely for investors to make investment decisions.  Mutual Fund with Specific Purposes
 
1. Property Fund is a retail fund established for the specific purpose of seeking benefits from freehold or leasehold of a property. It gives the investing public an alternative access to property investment and an opportunity to earn stable income mainly from leasehold. A property fund is prohibited to seek any benefit other than rental fees and its investment units must be distributed to the investing public fairly and thoroughly.   
 
2. Infrastructure Fund is a vehicle for raising capital for an infrastructure project developed by a public or private developer. This helps to curb budgetary burdens and public debts as well as offer a financing alternative for business sectors. An infrastructure fund gains returns from the infrastructure project in which it invests and pays dividends to investors.   
 
The approval criteria include types of investible projects, investment in green field projects, ability to raise fund through investment units and loans, and investor protection. Also, characteristics of infrastructure funds must comply with the governing regulations.  
 
3. Thai Trust Fund is a mutual fund established to facilitate investment made by foreigners by alleviating the constraints on foreign shareholding limit on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).
 
Thai Trust Fund is not subject to strict supervision as it is not offered to the general public and established for specific purposes.

Private fund / Provident fund 
 
1. Private Fund is a pooled fund collected from no more than 35 investors, managed by a licensed asset management company and investing in securities or other assets according to the agreement made with the investors. Unlike mutual fund, private fund is not a juristic person and, therefore, to protect investors’ interest, the SEC regulations require that the responsible asset management company appoint an SEC-approved private fund manager and that the private fund’s assets be segregated from the management company’s proprietary portfolio to prevent seeking of improper benefits from the private fund’s assets. The asset management company must appoint an SEC-approved custodian to safeguard the private fund’s assets. The custodian too must separate the private fund’s assets from its own proprietary portfolio. 
 
2. Provident Fund is a fund set up voluntarily between an employer and its employees as an incentive for the latter to earn additional savings for retirement or resignation. The pooled fund consists of money contributed by both parties. Initially, provident funds were supervised by the Ministry of Finance and later came under the SEC supervision of asset management business on March 30, 2000. 
 
Regulations on provident funds are generally in line with those governing mutual and private funds. This includes asset segregation, asset custody, prevention of conflicts of interest, investment restrictions, asset valuation, information disclosure, investors’ choice and unitization of members’ rights. 
 
Provident fund is managed by private fund manager who is approved by the SEC and appointed by the asset management company. The SEC is the registrar of provident funds, registers amendments to the fund articles and gives advice on members’ rights.     More information on provident funds is available at http://www.thaipvd.com.

Derivative Warrants (DW)
 
Derivative warrant is an instrument that gives holders the right to buy or sell the underlying securities or the right to earn profits from DW prices or underlying asset’s index. At present, the SEC allows an offer for sale of DW with securities as the underlying asset. A DW issuer is a third party which is not the listed company issuing the underlying securities. Generally, there are two types of derivative warrant, as follows:
 
1. DW having no assets/securities as collateral: The risk of such DW is subject to an issuer’s obligation to deliver the underlying securities or pay the differences. To grant an approval for offering of non-collateral DW, the SEC considers the issuer’s risk management, financial condition and operating system. Eligible issuers are securities companies or commercial banks having in place a robust risk management system, financial stability and effective control and operation.
 
2. DW having assets/securities as collateral in full: The risk of such DW is on the safety of the collateral. Instead of the issuer’s risk management, the SEC considers the safekeeping of the underlying securities by trustee, as specified by the Trust for Transactions in Capital Market Act B.E. 2550 (2007).
 
In supervising DW issuance, the SEC emphasizes the issuer’s information disclosure on financial condition and risk management. For each issuance, the issuer must disclose information of the company whose securities is used as the underlying asset. In determining permissible underlying assets or securities, the SEC considers the liquidity of the assets or securities and compliance with the derivatives law.
