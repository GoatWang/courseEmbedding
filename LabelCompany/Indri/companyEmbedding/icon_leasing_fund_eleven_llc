Stock fraud attorneys investigate ICON Leasing Fund Eleven and Twelve

By Fitapelli Kurta






 


The securities fraud law firm, Fitapelli Kurta is investigating claims against broker-dealer firms like NFP Securities and WFG Investments, as well as any other broker-dealer firm that recommended ICON Leasing Fund Eleven and Twelve to investors.
According to their website, ICON Advisers is, “an active, value investing manager offering 18 Mutual Funds, eight Allocation Portfolios and three Strategy Based Investment Portfolios.” ICON Leasing Fund Eleven and ICON Leasing Fund Twelve are among those mutual funds offered by ICON Advisers. ICON Eleven and Twelve raise revenue by using investor funds to purchase equipment that is subject to a lease. The Fund then ideally purchases the equipment at the expiration of the lease. These investments were illiquid and any dividends it may have yielded could not be predicted, contrary to what many investors were promised.
According to recent SEC filings as well as ICON Fund reports, the investments started off profitable for investors, however have recently yielded significantly less dividends. Furthermore, many investors may not have been informed of the inherent risks associated with these types of investments. Many investors were promised a return of their principal as well as dividends every year in excess of 9%. These promises turned out to be empty and now investors are scrambling to recover losses and make ends meet.
Under both federal securities laws and FINRA Rules, broker-dealer firms offering investments like ICON Leasing Fund Eleven and ICON Leasing Fund Twelve have a duty to inform their investors of the significant risks involved in these investments. Additionally, brokers and their firms have a duty to make only suitable investment recommendations to their investors. This means they must consider the investor’s objectives, source of income, age, risk tolerance, etc. before making any investment recommendations.
When a broker makes unsuitable investment recommendations, both the broker and their firm may be liable for the investor’s losses. The law provides a path to recovery for investors who have lost money investing in funds like ICON Leasing Fund Eleven and ICON Leasing Fund Twelve by way of arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This arbitration process can be long and at time complicated for investors who attempt to represent themselves and the likelihood of recovering their losses is significantly diminished.
Based on New York City, the securities fraud law firm Fitapelli Kurta has extensive experience representing investors in FINRA arbitration cases. Our firm sues broker-dealer firms who have failed to properly supervise their brokers, or who have allowed their brokers to make unsuitable investment recommendations in products like ICON Leasing Fund Eleven and ICON Leasing Fund Twelve.
All of our cases are taken on a contingency fee basis which means we do not recover any money unless you win your case. Call now to speak directly to an attorney. We would love to further discuss the merits of your case and our consultations are always free. Time is of the essence in filing a claim to recover losses with FINRA, so do not wait. Call now for your free consultation.

Investors in Icon Leasing Fund Eleven May Have Securities Arbitration Claim
by InvestorLawyers on September 13, 2012
in Arbitration,FINRA,New York


Stock fraud lawyers are currently investigating claims on behalf of investors of Icon Leasing Fund Eleven investors. A recent announcement stated that investors will not be able to withdraw their money from Icon for another seven years longer than originally agreed. ICON Leasing Fund Eleven LLC participates in the purchasing and leasing of various types of equipment to third parties in Europe, Canada and the United States. Based in New York and founded in 2004, Icon also provides equipment and other financing.

Like any private placement, the high risks associated with Icon Leasing Fund Eleven investments are only appropriate for sophisticated, high-net-worth investors. However, according to securities arbitration lawyers, the commissions offered to brokers and brokerage firms for this investment were high enough that some broker-dealers recommended this investment to clients for whom it was unsuitable without adequately disclosing the risks associated with the investment. Furthermore, stock fraud lawyers say information that is now available indicates that many of the firms selling the product did not adequately perform the necessary due diligence.
The following investments made up the bulk of Icon Leasing Fund Eleven’s portfolio as of March 21, 2012:

A term loan to Northern Leasing Systems Inc. affiliates.
The Teal Jones Group and Teal Jones Lumber Services plant, equipment and machinery.
A 45 percent interest in a semiconductor manufacturing equipment ownership joint venture.
A Heuliez SA and Heuliez Investissements SNC auto parts manufacturing equipment lease.
A 55 percent interest in a plastic films and flexible packaging manufacturing equipment for consumer products ownership joint venture.
The Senang Spirit, a crude oil tanker.
A 6.33 percent interest in a machining and metal working equipment ownership joint venture.

If you are an Icon Leasing Fund Eleven investor, you may have a valid securities arbitration claim. To find out more about your legal rights and options, contact a securities arbitration lawyer at The Law Office of Christopher J. Gray at (866) 966-9598 for a no-cost, confidential consultation.

Investors Name Icon Investments in Securities Arbitration Claims

by Shepherd Smith Edwards & Kantas LTD LLP






 


Investors are accusing brokerage firms of making inappropriate recommendations and selling investments in Icon Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC and Icon Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC to them even though they would not be able to withstand the high risks. The two funds are registered, non-traded Equipment Leasing Direct Participation Programs (DPPs). 
Not only are the Icon Eleven and Icon Twelve investments very high risk and illiquid investments, but also there are little if any secondary markets where their shares can be sold.  Investment dividends from Icon cannot be predicted because they are contingent upon profits made from equipment leases.
During their offering periods, the two funds started paying distributions. However, not long after Icon Eleven and Twelve stopped taking new investors, the investments’ value started to drop fast and dividend payments became inconsistent. The decline has resulted in significant financial losses for investors.
In one quarterly report from almost a year ago  Icon Leasing Fund Twelve noted that its liabilities are far greater than its assets. SEC documents from the end of 2012 show that Icon Eleven’s estimated per share value was $159.31, which is a more than 84% decline in share value.
Meantime, as investors have sustained losses,  Icon Investments purportedly gave financial firms and their investment advisers among the biggest commissions for alternative products. The Icon Leasing Fund Eleven and Icon Leasing Fund Twelve have been accused of using just 81% of investors’ money to buy actual equipment while 18% of these funds went toward fees, commissions, and expenses. 
Also, regulator filings reveal that Icon Funds reserved the right to buy shares for affiliates and officers at a discount. This approach would have earned higher returns for Icon-related entities while the value of investors’ shares would have been harmed.
If you are an investor in the United States who has sustained losses related to the Icon Leasing Fund Twelve, the Icon Leasing Fund Eleven, or the Icon Leasing Fund Ten, please contact our Icon Investment Fraud law firm today. Our alternative investment fraud attorneys would like to offer you a free case consultation. You may have grounds for a FINRA arbitration case. 
Direct Participation Programs (DPPS0
Icon Trusts are registered, non-traded Equipment Leasing Direct Participation Programs (DPPs). Although registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, DPPs are not found on public exchanges. Their lack of an active secondary market makes it hard for retail investors to independently assess the prices charged for these investments. Detecting fraud can also be harder. 
With equipment leasing DPPs, a sponsor sells units of limited partnership. The substantial offering costs are subtracted while the rest of the money made is invested in a pool of equipment leases that were leveraged by more borrowing. This type of DPP touts a reliable income stream. However, a substantial number of the distributions that are given to investors are not income but a return of capital. And while partners may market the tax benefits, such as depreciation deductions and interest payment on borrowing employed to leverage, to investors, these benefits can only be applied to offset income from other passive investments.
Often, investors will get less than what they originally put into equipment leasing DPPs. Recently, Icon Leasing investors were told that the company would no longer pay dividends on certain funds. 
A number of brokerage firms have been accused of not telling investors about the risks involved. Investors have also accused Icon of failing to do the necessary due diligence before selling this type of equipment leasing DPPs to customers.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Manager's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Our Manager's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions. Please refer to "Part I. Forward-Looking Statements" located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview  We operate as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our members invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquire equipment subject to lease, purchase equipment and lease it to third parties, provide equipment and other financing and, to a lesser degree, acquire ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. Some of our equipment leases are acquired for cash and are expected to provide current cash flow, which we refer to as "income" leases. For our other equipment leases, we finance the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties. We refer to these leases as "growth" leases. These growth leases generate little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments received from the lessee are used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease. For these leases, we anticipate that the future value of the leased equipment will exceed our cash portion of the purchase price.  Our Manager manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, under the terms of our LLC Agreement.  We are currently in our operating period, which will end on April 30, 2014 after having been extended for two years. During our operating period, additional investments were made with the cash generated from our investments to the extent that the cash was not needed for expenses, reserves and distributions to members. The investment in additional equipment leases and other financing transactions in this manner is called "reinvestment." We will commence our liquidation period on May 1, 2014, which we expect to continue for approximately one year.  Current Business Environment  Recent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.  Table of contents  Our Manager believes the U.S. economy is likely to continue its gradual recovery, with the pace of economic growth increasing through 2014 due to factors such as the rate of employment expansion and greater certainty with respect to U.S. tax and budget policies.  Significant Transactions  We engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:  Aframax Product Tankers  On May 3, 2012, we sold the Senang Spirit for gross proceeds of approximately $7,173,000. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $697,715 during the year ended December 31, 2012.  On May 3, 2012, in connection with the sale of the Senang Spirit, we settled the outstanding debt balance of approximately $9,400,000 at an agreed upon amount of approximately $7,347,000. Accordingly, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2,053,000 during the year ended December 31, 2012.  Manufacturing Equipment  We invested approximately $13,427,000 in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, partly through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ICON EAR II, LLC ("ICON EAR II"), and partly through a joint venture, ICON EAR, LLC ("ICON EAR"), owned 45% by us and 55% by ICON Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC, an entity also managed by our Manager ("Fund Twelve"). ICON EAR II and ICON EAR are collectively referred to as the "ICON EAR entities". All of the equipment was leased to Equipment Acquisition Resources, Inc. ("EAR"). As additional security for the purchases and leases, the ICON EAR entities received mortgages on certain parcels of real property located in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  In October 2009, certain facts came to light that led our Manager to believe that EAR was perpetrating a fraud against EAR's lenders, including the ICON EAR entities. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  On June 7, 2010, the ICON EAR entities received judgments in the New York State Supreme Court against two principals of EAR who had guaranteed EAR's lease obligations. The ICON EAR entities have had the New York State Supreme Court judgments recognized in Illinois, where the principals live, but do not currently anticipate being able to collect on such judgments.  On June 20, 2011, the ICON EAR entities filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio, against the auditors of EAR alleging malpractice and negligent misrepresentation. On May 3, 2012, the case was settled in the ICON EAR entities' favor for $590,000, of which our portion was approximately $360,000.  On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleges were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Manager filed an answer to the complaint, which included certain affirmative defenses. Our Manager believes these claims are frivolous and intends to vigorously defend this action. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this action or loss therefrom.  Subsequent to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, EAR disclaimed any right to its equipment and such equipment became the subject of an Illinois State Court proceeding. The equipment was subsequently sold as part of the Illinois State Court proceeding. On March 6, 2012, one of the creditors in the Illinois State Court proceeding won a summary judgment motion filed against the ICON EAR entities, thereby dismissing the ICON EAR entities' claims to the proceeds resulting from the sale of the EAR equipment. The ICON EAR entities appealed this decision. On September 16, 2013, the lower court's ruling was affirmed by the Illinois Appellate Court. On October 21, 2013, the ICON EAR entities filed a Petition for Leave to Appeal with the Supreme Court of Illinois appealing the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court, which petition was denied on January 29, 2014. The only remaining asset owned by ICON EAR at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was real property with a carrying value of approximately $290,000 and the carrying value of our investment in the joint venture was approximately $134,000. At  Table of contents  December 31, 2013 and 2012, the only remaining asset owned by ICON EAR II was real property with a carrying value of approximately $117,000, which is included in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets.  On January 4, 2012, MW Universal, Inc. ("MWU") and certain of its subsidiaries satisfied their obligations relating to two of the three lease schedules. On August 20, 2012, we sold the automotive manufacturing equipment subject to lease with LC Manufacturing and terminated warrants issued to us for aggregate proceeds of approximately $8,300,000. As a result, based on our 6.33% ownership interest in ICON MW, LLC, our joint venture with Fund Twelve, we received proceeds in the amount of approximately $525,000 and recognized a loss on the sale of approximately $6,000. In addition, our Manager evaluated the collectability of the personal guaranty of a previous owner of LC Manufacturing and, based on the findings, ICON MW, LLC recorded a credit loss of approximately $5,411,000, of which our portion was approximately $343,000. In February 2013, we commenced an action against such guarantor, which is currently pending.  On April 8, 2013, HSA and Heuliez filed for "Redressement Judiciaire", a proceeding under French law similar to Chapter 11 reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During the quarter ended September 30, 2013, we were notified by the French bankruptcy court of the court's intention to liquidate the companies. Our Manager estimated the amount to be recovered in the liquidation proceedings based on a third-party appraisal and determined that a credit loss reserve in the amount of approximately ?1,738,846 ($2,324,000) was required.  On October 31, 2013, our finance lease with HSA and Heuliez was terminated. Effective as of November 1, 2013, we leased our auto parts manufacturing equipment to a third party who purchased most of Heuliez's other real estate and movable assets pursuant to the bankruptcy proceeding for an amount of ?2,000 per month. The lease is for a renewable 3 month period, may be terminated by either party and automatically terminates upon our sale of the auto parts manufacturing equipment. We expect to sell such assets and have engaged a third party to actively locate a buyer. As of December 31, 2013, the auto parts manufacturing equipment is included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale.  On October 7, 2013, we, upon the expiration of the lease with Pliant Corporation ("Pliant"), sold the plastic processing and printing equipment previously on lease to Pliant for $7,000,000. As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain on sale of assets of approximately $2,400,000. Additionally, we had a remarketing agreement associated with our lease with Pliant. As a result of the sale, our remarketing liability increased to approximately $1,587,000 due to recording an additional remarketing expense of approximately $914,000 during the year ended December 31, 2013. Subsequent to the sale, the remarketing liability was satisfied.  Lumber processing equipment  On March 8, 2013, the Teal Jones Group and Teal Jones Lumber Services, Inc. (collectively, "Teal Jones") satisfied their obligations in connection with the mortgage note receivable and lease financing arrangement by making a prepayment of approximately $22,698,000. In connection with the prepayment, we recorded a net loss of approximately $611,000 related to the release of the accumulation of currency translation adjustments.  Mining Equipment  On August 5, 2013, we purchased mining equipment for approximately $1,979,000. The equipment is subject to a 36 month lease with Murray and its affiliate. The lease expires on August 31, 2016.  On September 12, 2013, a joint venture owned by us, Fund Twelve and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen, an entity also managed by our Manager ("Fund Sixteen"), purchased mining equipment for approximately $15,107,000. The equipment is subject to a 24 month lease with Murray, which expires on September 30, 2015. On December 1, 2013, Fund Sixteencontributed capital of $933,678 to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees, resulting in a reallocation of the percentage ownership interests in the joint venture to 67.0% by us, 26.4% by Fund Twelve and 6.6% by Fund Sixteen. On February 1, 2014, Fund Sixteen contributed additional capital of $1,725,517 to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees, resulting in a further reallocation of the percentage ownership interests in the joint venture to 67.0% by us, 13.2% by Fund Twelve and 19.8% by Fund Sixteen.  Notes Receivable  On May 2, 2012, Northern Capital Associates XIV, L.P. satisfied its obligations in connection with certain notes receivable by making a prepayment of $1,015,000. No material gain or loss resulted from the prepayment.  Table of contents  Between May and October of 2012, subsidiaries of Revstone Transportation, LLC (collectively, "Revstone") borrowed approximately $1,139,000 in connection with a secured capital expenditure loan (the "CapEx Loan"). The CapEx Loan bore interest at 17% per year and was expected to mature on March 1, 2017. The CapEx Loan was secured by a first priority security interest in the automotive manufacturing equipment purchased with the proceeds from the CapEx Loan. On November 15, 2012, Revstone satisfied its obligations in connection with the CapEx Loan by making a prepayment of approximately $1,208,000, which included a prepayment fee of approximately $57,000, which was recognized as additional finance income.  On November 28, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $5,400,000 to SAE. The loan bears interest at 13.5% per year and is for a period of 48 months. The loan is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in all the existing and thereafter acquired assets, including seismic testing equipment, of SAE and its parent company, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. ("SAE Holdings"), and a pledge of all the equity interests in SAE and SAE Holdings. In addition, we acquired warrants, exercisable until December 5, 2022, to purchase 0.0675% of the outstanding common stock of SAE Holdings. On October 31, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement with SAE to amend certain provisions and covenant ratios. As a result of the amendment, we received an amendment fee of approximately $41,000.  On February 12, 2013, we made available a secured term loan in the amount of $3,300,000 to NTS as part of a $6,000,000 facility. On March 28, 2013, NTS borrowed $935,000 in connection with the loan and on June 27, 2013, NTS drew down the remaining $2,365,000 from the facility. The loan bears interest at 12.75% per year and matures on July 1, 2017. The loan is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the equipment and assets of NTS.  On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 39% by us, 21% by Fund Twelve, and 40% by ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P., an entity also managed by our Manager ("Fund Fifteen"), purchased a portion of an approximately $208,000,000 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered. The aggregate purchase price for the joint venture's portion of the subordinated facility was $28,462,500. The subordinated credit facility bears interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15.0% per year and matures in January 2021. The subordinated credit facility is secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant, and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. Our initial contribution to the joint venture was approximately $11,101,000.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which requires an entity to disclose information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component on the respective line items of net (loss) income. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 became effective for us on January 1, 2013 and did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Parent's Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity, which clarifies guidance to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment when an entity sells all or part of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. We are required to adopt ASU 2013-05 on January 1, 2014, which is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  Critical Accounting Policies  An understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires our Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, deferred tax valuation allowances, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:  * Lease classification and revenue recognition; * Asset impairments; * Depreciation; * Notes receivable and revenue recognition;  Table of contents  * Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; * Derivative financial instruments; and * Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or liabilities.  Lease Classification and Revenue Recognition  Each equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.  Our Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.  The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.  For finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.  For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.  Asset Impairments  The significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income in the period the determination is made.  The events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Manager's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.  Depreciation  Table of contents  We record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Notes Receivable and Revenue Recognition  Notes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.  Credit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve  Our Manager weighs all credit decisions based on a combination of external credit ratings as well as internal credit evaluations of all borrowers. A borrower's credit is analyzed using those credit ratings as well as the borrower's financial statements and other financial data deemed relevant.  As our financing receivables, generally finance leases and notes receivable, are limited in number, our Manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio based metrics and credit loss reserve. Financing receivables are analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on payment history. If a financing receivable becomes non-performing due to a borrower's missed scheduled payments or failed financial covenants, our Manager analyzes whether a credit loss reserve should be established or whether the financing receivable should be restructured. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.  Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Manager's judgment, these accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status.  In accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual loans is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Loans in non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.  When our Manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing note receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the asset underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing note receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the loan.  Derivative Financial Instruments  We may enter into derivative transactions for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We enter into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for . . .
