Chan Zuckerberg Initiative pledges $5M to home down payments for teachers

Inturn raises $22.5 million to help you buy clothes at a discount












When housing costs too much or educators have to commute from far away, there’s rapid teacher turnover that hurts students. That’s why Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s philanthropy vehicle is funding home down payment assistance for roughly 60 educators and support staff at three schools near Facebook’s headquarters.
The $45 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is putting $5 million into a fund for Landed, a Y Combinator startup that offers to pay up to half of the 20% home down payment for educators with zero interest or monthly payments. Instead, Landed recoups its investment when the home is sold or refinanced, assuming up to 25% of the appreciation or depreciation of the home’s value.
Any money earned from the upside on the Landed’s investment will be put back into the CZI fund to make it sustainable and fund down payments for more educators. Meanwhile, Landed makes its money by taking a cut of the standard referral fee earned by real estate agents that it connects to the educators buying homes, who don’t pay any extra to use Landed.
The goal is to allow more educators, administrators, janitors, and more to live near their jobs at Redwood City, Ravenswood City, and Sequoia Union high schools, where Silicon Valley’s tech boom has made home prices otherwise out of reach of these critical community members. CZI posted on Facebook that “More broadly, our hope is that our partnership with Landed will help create a sustainable model to help make homeownership a reality for more educators and others at risk of getting priced out of the communities they serve.”
Landed CEO Jonathan Asmis writes that “While making housing more accessible will require many approaches, we hope this kind of down payment support will help to make it a little easier for great educators to stay and build successful careers in the region.”
CZI has mostly focused its donations and investments on health science and education, like its $3 billion BioHub initiative to end disease. But it’s also funding programs for the underprivileged. Earlier this year it gave $3.1 million to East Palo Alto’s Community Legal Services, which offers legal assistance such as fighting landlords to families suffering from the local house crisis. CZI also gave $500,000 to UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation, that seeks to generate long-term solutions to Bay Area housing shortage.

To get access to the Landed fund, educators in the designated districts can apply on its website.
They’re paired with a local lender who can determine if they qualify for the necessary mortgage, and then connected to a real estate agent who finds them the right home. The buyer must put up at least 50% of the down payment, and Landed pays the rest in exchange for an equity stake in the home.
There are no interest rates or monthly payments for the Landed contribution, just the mortgage. Years later when the buyer refinances to buy out Landed’s stake or when they sell their home, its value is appraised. If it’s gone up, Landed shares in up to 25% of the upside, while if it’s gone down, it shoulders up to 25% of the burden. CZI’s Landed fund will soak up both, and reinvest proceeds in other down payments.
Asmis tells TechCrunch that stable housing for teachers can have a big positive impact on the educational outcomes for kids. “The amount of money and resources and time that school districts and schools have to put into constantly hiring and rehiring staff, because they’re coming for a few years and then leaving because housing is too expensive, could be spent elsewhere.”  
Teachers have it tough enough already. They show up to work earlier than most of us, and have to be on point managing children all day instead of spacing out in front of a computer. The closer they live to their school, the more time and energy they have for inspiring kids.
The hope is that since home values trend upward over time, educators will have enough from their Landed deal’s upside to buy their next home unassisted. Asmis says Landed is “a stair-step to ownership.”
Today’s investment proves why Zuckerberg and Chan decided to make CZI an LLC rather than a traditional charity. Instead of just giving away the $5 million, these quasi-loans that can actually generate more money could become an evergreen fund for housing assistance.

PDP’s  principals have worked with a broad array of equity partners and banks over the  past two decades in the acquisition, development and redevelopment of numerous  projects.  PDP seeks to generate  exceptional returns for its financial partners while preserving capital through prudent risk-taking.   Following is a partial list of our partners and lenders:
AIOAngelo GordonAppian CapitalArchstone SmithBank of the West Comerica Bank Concierge Asset Management (Maxwell Drever) Devcon Construction First Republic Bank Imperial Capital BankLubert Adler McIntosh Properties Merrill Lynch Capital RREEF Stockbridge  Talcott Holdings, Inc W.P. Carey





What our partners say about us
Archstone  Smith
PDP projects with Archstone Smith (a  $20 billion National apartment owner) include the acquisition, management, and  re-development of Fox Plaza in downtown San Francisco, CA:  a $150 million, one million square foot apartment, office, retail, condominium  and parking garage project.  Scot Sellers Chief Executive Officer Archstone Smith
 “I have  known Mark Conroe for over 30 years and have seen his consistent commitment to  excellence over the many different facets of the real estate industry he has  been involved with.  Mark did a great job as CEO of City Center Retail  Trust and has been a successful developer of apartment, condominium, hotel and  office projects in cities around the country.  Our company has been partners  with PDP on several projects and their performance has been excellent.   Mark did a great job on the entitlements and planning of Fox Plaza  in one of the toughest City’s for gaining permits in the country.  We  would gladly do more business with PDP.”

Concierge  Asset Management
PDP projects with  Maxwell Drever (a 40 year veteran of residential and commercial real estate,  having owned hundreds of millions of dollars of property throughout the U.S.,  and founder of a number of successful real estate operating companies) include:  (1) the redevelopment of the historic Flour Mill in Spokane, WA: an $18  million, 150,000 square foot retail, office and residential condo project; (2)  the redevelopment of Rincon Circle Commercial Condominiums in San Jose, CA: a $10  million, 60,000 square foot industrial project which was redeveloped into  commercial condominiums and sold; (3) the redevelopment of 290 Ferguson in  Mountain View, CA: a $19M  rezoning of an office park to 104 townhomes with subsequent sale to a homebuilder;  and (4) the redevelopment of The Springs Business Park in Colorado Springs, CO:  an $11 million, 120,000 square foot redevelopment of an office project.
Maxwell Drever Chairman, Founder Concierge Asset Management
“We have partnered  with PDP on a number of successful real estate projects.  Over the past 10  years, I have come to appreciate Mark Conroe’s experience, insight, and work  ethic.  I have found him to be completely reliable and trustworthy; in  each project that PDP did for us, our expectations were exceeded and the  project realized excellent financial results.  We are actively looking for  new projects in which to invest with PDP. “

Devcon  Construction
PDP projects with Devcon  Construction (one of the largest general contractors in the S.F. Bay Area)  include the development of a $40 million, 500,000 square foot retail, office,  hotel and parking garage project in downtown Boise, ID.
Gary Filizetti President Devcon Construction, Inc.
“I have worked  with Mark Conroe for over 20 years both as a developer client and as our  development partner.  Mark was instrumental in managing the development  activities for our downtown Boise  project and ensuring that this investment achieved excellent  profitability.  This project was very complex due to the multiple product  types built, the public-private partnership with the City, and the intricate  financing involved; Mark managed all aspects of the project in a professional  and expert fashion, and most importantly, he watched over our invested capital  as if it was his own.  In my business trust is paramount, and I trust Mark  without reservation.  Mark knows how to make money in the development  business, which is why we are currently working on additional investment  opportunities with PDP.”

RREEF
PDP projects with RREEF (a $60  billion international institutional advisor and owner of real estate) include:  (1) the redevelopment of Benecia Fleetside in Benecia, CA: a $15 million,  110,000 square foot industrial project; and (2) the California Value Added Land  Fund: a $50 million fund focused on land development opportunities funded by  Cal Smart (a RREEF/CalPERS venture).
Ross Berry Managing Director RREEF
“RREEF hired Mark  Conroe’s firm to manage the re-development of our Benecia Fleetside industrial  project.  Mark brought his depth of experience and expertise to this  challenging project and made this project a success.  This led RREEF to  form the $50 million California Land Fund with PDP and CalSmart to pursue land  development opportunities.  I have known Mark for over 15 years and think  he is a savvy developer and operator of complex real estate projects; our  experience with his company as our partner was excellent.”

Stockbridge
PDP is pursuing new investment  opportunities with Stockbridge and has completed projects in the past with  Stockbridge executives at their former companies.
Dwight Merriman Chief Investment Officer, Managing Director Stockbridge Real Estate Funds
“Over 20 years I  have seen Mark Conroe excel in a number of different capacities: as the head of  National development for Homestead   Village, as the CEO of  City Center Retail Trust, and as the leader of PDP.  Mark is a developer  with deep and diverse experience who has a clear grasp of the capital and local  market trends that create opportunities as well as the fundamentals that create  a profitable real estate project.”

Talcott  Holdings
PDP projects with Ephraim Greenwall  (a 25 year Bay Area veteran real estate investor) include: (1) the development  of 30 single family homes in Los Altos, CA; and (2) the redevelopment of 8th Street Market Place in downtown Boise, Idaho,  a $10 million, 120,000 square foot retail and office project.
Ephraim Greenwall President and Founder Talcott Holdings, Inc
“Talcott Holdings  has invested in real estate projects with Mark Conroe in Silicon Valley and in Boise, ID  over the past two decades. In every case, the investment performance far  exceeded our expectations.  Mark is one of the most analytically focused  and intelligent real estate minds with whom we have invested over the span of  three decades. PDP was instrumental in refinancing the debt on our 8th Street  Marketplace project in a very tough financing market and has continued to add  value by increasing occupancy and rents during one of the toughest leasing  markets in decades.”

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
