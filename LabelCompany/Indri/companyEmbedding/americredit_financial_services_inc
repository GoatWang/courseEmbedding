BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Our Experience
In a financial downturn, several finance companies are weary of lending to potential customers. If you are an existing customer, AmeriCredit Financial Services is more than willing to speak to you about your account. Fortunately, the company is an alternative lender and is willing to discuss the products available. When we contacted the company, we experienced a automated system easy to navigated which direct us to the various product and services available from the company. After waiting approximately 2 minutes, we were able to speak to a customer care representative. We asked questions regarding applying for financial services.
The representative gave insightful answers and was professional. AmeriCredit Financial Services is a customer centered company which provided top-notch customer care. Our experience was pleasant. Was your experience similar? We want to hear your story. Share your insights below.

Overall, I have had no problems with Americredit/GM Financial. But I can almost never get through. I call during business hours and the recording always tells me the business hours and to call back during business hours. This is the worst on Saturdays. I talked to someone earlier this week who said specifically that she will be working this Saturday (today). I have been calling for about an hour, have emailed and still has not been fixed. I really wish they would fix this. This is not the first time I’ve had the same issue and I’m sure it’s not the last.

I spoke with Manuel in bankruptcy dept. He was extremely rude he talked over me would not let me get a word in he was not sympathetic about anything the man was a total  jerk. I will tell every one I know not to go through AmeriCredit. I will also twitter and facebooK my experience with Manuel and his lack of customer service. Its to bad that AmeriCredit let’s people like Him represent them makes me think all there reps are like that,!

I am very impressed with the level of customer service that I recieved from Clint, one of your Customer Service Representatives.  I had the unfortunate luck of falling behind on a medical bill, which was turned over the AmeriCredit for collections.  When I recieved the voice mail (which was extremely professional, also) I thought “oh great..i heave to deal with a mean collections officer”.  But, when I called and spoke with Clint, he put me at ease right away through his very calm and professional demeanor.  He and I talked and he offered up several payment options that were very accomidating to the situation.
A lot of businesses that are in the customer service industry should take note as to how your Customer Service Represenatatives treat and interact with customers.  Very well done, Clint!

purchased a automobile on Friday October 17,2014 and its not what the payments we thought it would be so contacted the dealership and Americredit to return the car but Americredit don’t have any paperwork and seem like we are getting a run around with trying to talk to someone. One man told us not to make a payment and let them come pick it up as a repoe it!!!

AmeriCredit sucks.  They harassed everyday when I trying very hard to setup a payment plan because my ex husband left hanging with his car that was in my name.  They start calling  early in the morning, and late as 9 0’clock at night.  That car was only 13,000 when he purchased.  I ended up paying AmeriCredit 22,000 dollars.  Their customer service stinks, the reps are very rude, and they harass the heck out you if a payment is late.  I never deal with again.

I love this bank.  I called in around 2 p.m. was transferred to a rep, where she was more than happy to help me.  I was able to extend my loan by a few months.  I even received a card in the mail the next week thanking me for staying with them.  I never had a bank that was this great.  The reps here are extremely the best.  Thank you Karin your the best.

I don’t have a vehicle financed with this company, never tried to get a vehicle financed with this company, never will apply to this company for financing. There is an inquiry on my credit report from this company and I didn’t buy a car at the time of this inquiry. However, when speaking to Jennifer (operator 4378), she tells me that I have to go to the dealership to get this off of my credit, even though the inquiry is listed as AmeriCredit Financial Svcs. I asked for a copy of a application with my signature and she says that they don’t have one. Being a records management professional with more than 20 years of experience, I know that this is a bunch of crock!!! She says that she can’t transfer me to the funding department. If Jennifer is correct in her statements, I would beware of doing business with this company, they can’t provide documentation to support their actions. Reporting them to the Federal Trade Commission for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

I will never do business with these people again. I told them to come and get their car after I had spent over $5000 on repairs for the timing chain on 4 different occasions. They then sold the car at an auction and then demanded I pay what they did not collect for the remaining balance. I told they had the car and I did not have the car I was not going to pay for something I did not have. They then for the tax year of 2013 they told the IRS they sent a 1099, which they did not and cost me over $1000…do not do business with these people. I know I will never again.

I filed bankruptcy and listed this company with a balance on my auto loan, and that was in 2007, and they never repo’d the car and I still have it and when I called to tell them to come and get it or release the title (GM) as well, the loss prevention (bankruptcy) division and told me that if I wanted the title I would have to pay 2600, that is double what I originally owed and the guy was so rude and laughed at me, and now it has been 8 years and I am stuck with a car I dont even want, cant even give it away, they are a horrible company!!


Reply
