Acquires A ProfitablePellet Production And Electricity Generation PlantAccesswireAugust 7, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareTAMPA, FL, United States / ACCESSWIRE / Aug 7, 2014 / Kleangas Energy Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: KGET) is pleased to announce that It has signed a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement acquiring an expansive Clean Energy Company that has a production capacity of 15,000 MT (Metric Tons) of Pellets per year and generates approximately 2.4 MW (Mega Watts) of electricity. This acquisition brings into Kleangas a company generating over $1,500,000 in gross revenue and an EBITDA of more than $600,000. Both operations are green environmentally friendly operations generated out of this one facility.The plant burns waste landfill gases to create electricity, which in turn is sold into the grid and purchased by major utilities. This electricity is purchased by the Utilities at a premium to fossil fuel produced electricity because it is clean/renewable energy. Each state is mandated to reach certain levels of clean energy within the next few years. Most states are not close to reaching these mandated levels so they in turn are will to pay a hefty premium for this clean energy.This facility also uses the heat generated by the burning of the landfill gas to create wood pellets. Wood pellets are used as an alternative to coal as a fuel, which is burned to create electricity. This 20,000 sq. ft. facility sits on 5 acres of land. The current facility can be doubled in size. Enough Pellet lines can be added in to bring monthly pellet production to more than 5,000 metric tons per month. An additional facility can be cost effectively added to the land allowing for future pellet production to easy exceed more than 10,000 metric tons a month.Mr. Linton CEO of Kleangas stated, “This acquisition fits perfectly within our core business of being a green energy company by producing electricity from landfill gas and using the heat from burning the landfill gas to create wood pellets. The land associated with this acquisition can allow us to double the facility from over 20,000 sq. ft. to over 40,000 sq. ft. which means we can double the electricity generated from 2.4 MW to almost 5MW and the pellets produced from 15,000 MT to over 30,000 MT. We are fortunate that we do not have to seek buyers for the electricity generated nor for the wood pellets produced due to the high demand for both products.”For further updates please visit our website at http://www.kleangas.com/And additional information can be obtained if you;Like us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/kleangas, and orFollow us on Twitter at twitter.com/KleangasKleangas:Kleangas Energy Technologies, Inc., is a company dedicated to producing alternative clean technologies and products that promote energy efficiency throughout a wide range of applications.

Posted on April 18, 2017Kleangas Energy Technologies, Inc. (KGET: OTC Pink Current) | CaliPharms Enters Acquisition Discussions with United Cannabis Retailers, Inc. 

Apr 17, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service
Riverside, CA –
CaliPharms, Inc. (OTCPink:KGET), a Company operating in the California Medicinal Cannabis industry, publicly trading under the OTC Markets symbol â€œKGETâ€ is pleased to announce that CaliPharms has entered into acquisition discussions with United Cannabis Retailers, Inc. United Cannabis Retailers, Inc, is a cannabis product development company. That looks to enter unfulfilled market niches in the cannabis sector. UCR is rolling out their first conceptual product line Canna-Kitchen this year. UCR is focused on promoting its brands.
CaliPharms continues its rapid growth model by adding a product development company to its acquisition plans. CaliPharms has already acquired two cannabis farms and began development of a THC and CBD powder bulk sales network. The next phase of growth planned is entering the retail market with edibles and other cannabis products at the retail level. With the anticipated recreational laws going into effect next year, CaliPharms will have itself positioned to be an industry leader throughout the state of California.

OTC Disclosure & News Service
Riverside, CA –
CaliPharms, Inc. (OTCPink:KGET), a Company operating in the California Medicinal Cannabis industry, publicly trading under the OTC Markets symbol â€œKGETâ€ is pleased to announce that through it’s acquisi mghfmf tion of Pacific Cannabis Growers (PCG) (https://www.pcgrowers.com), it has been introduced to several other California based cannabis operations.
Preliminary talks are now underway with several cannabis farms and cannabis based product lines..,,,â€¦ PCG president Joshua Lee Clark stated: „We are glad to use our industry contacts to potentially help grow CaliPharms into one of the West Coasts largest medical marijuana suppliers. Our goals and vision matches  CaliPharms.  We strive for continued growth and wish to establish ourselves as the premier medical cannabis company in California.â€
CaliPharms CEO, Bo Linton stated, â€œEach of our acquisitions is a strategic growth opportunity to establish CaliPharms as a cannabis industry leader. Our goal is to supply the industry with high quality cannabis and also create our own product lines and cannabis services. Each of our acquisition brings on a great financial opportunity and perhaps just as importantly adds valuable cannabis industry professionals to  the CaliPharms team.â€
Linton continued, â€œSupport continues for recreational cannabis as Governors deliver an open letter to the Trump administration. In the letter governors asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to â€œengage with us before embarking on any changes to regulatory and enforcement systems.â€ Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska; Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado; Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon; and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington signed the letter. These Governors lead the first four states to allow recreational marijuana sales. Soon California will be on these letters and as the fifth largest economy on the planet, I am confident Californiaâ€™s recreational cannabis laws will have a major impact on federal policies.â€

Posted on March 29, 2017Kleangas Energy Technologies, Inc. (KGET: OTC Pink Current) | CaliPharms Expands its Operations with the Acquisition of Pacific Cannabis Growers 


RIVERSIDE, CA–(Marketwired – Mar 28, 2017) – CaliPharms, Inc. (OTC PINK: KGET), a Company operating in the California Medicinal Cannabis industry, is pleased to announce it has duly executed the definitive stock purchase agreement with Pacific Cannabis Growers (PCG), a Humboldt County California Medical Cannabis Farm. (www.pcgrowers.com)
PCG is a medical cannabis farm that is currently in the process of permitting land in Humboldt County for cultivation of medical cannabis. Seedlings are being grown as shown on the PCG website and a cannabis cultivation permit is expected to be issued sometime in late April. Upon the permit being issued, PCG will build fencing and prepare the area for cultivation. PCG expects to achieve two harvests in 2017 provided the permit comes in during April 2017.
CaliPharms has purchased 51% stock ownership of PCG in a structured buy out over a 5 year period. The terms of the agreement are based on the profitability of PCG. The final purchase price is based on the actual profit margin of PCG. In the event the market conditions change in the cannabis growing industry, the agreement with the parties has the flexibility to adjust the final purchase price. The agreement is based on a ten times multiple in its profits and it is payable in CaliPharms preferred series stock. The preferred stock will be eligible to be sold in a leak out agreement over a 5 year period after it has been issued and aged under the applicable SEC rules.
Joshua Clark, President of Pacific Cannabis Growers, stated, „We are very pleased to be joining up with CaliPharms. This deal is performance driven, which will benefit us, CaliPharms and its shareholders in the long run. To be involved with a group as excited about the cannabis industry as we are is a blessing. We plan to produce top quality cannabis for the medical market and we value the long term goals of CaliPharms growth and sustainability.”
CaliPharms CEO Bo Linton stated, „Pacific Cannabis Growers is a very important part of our long term plan for continued growth. Joshua Clark is now a valuable part of the CaliPharms team and I couldn’t be more pleased to have his expertise, knowledge, and experience on our side.” Linton continued, „Joshua knows this California industry as good as or better than anyone and our goals and interests are aligned which is great news for all of our shareholders. This shareholder friendly deal structure only works because Joshua understands the long term value of our fledgling company and we are in it for the long run.”
CaliPharms long term business plan includes acquiring numerous cannabis production facilities and product lines. This will allow us to supply our other business ventures with the raw materials needed to make award winning cannabis products, and to create a new market suppling other canna-ventures with the raw material they need to produce their products. Securing CaliPharms cannabis supply/production capability is our top priority. This will help establish CaliPharms as an industry leader in the near future.
Pacific Cannabis Grower’s permit type (Mixed-Light) will allow for multiple harvests year round, in fully automated greenhouses, giving this acquisition additional value for Calipharms.
The farm will be operating a 10,000 sq ft „mixed light” commercial cannabis cultivation permit. *Mixed light is growing in greenhouse with artificial light supplementation; this allows for multiple harvests through the year. The estimated total 2017 Gross Harvest/Income value is $1,868,160.

CaliPharms Enters Wholesale Distribution Market  with Medical Cannabis CBD and THC Powders
Mar 13, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service
Riverside, CA
                            
                                - CaliPharms, Inc. (OTCPink:KGET), a Company operating in the California Medicinal Cannabis industry, publicly traded under its former name "Kleangas Energy Technologies, Inc." is pleased to announce it is entering into wholesale medical cannabis distribution, launching with a selection of CBD and THC powders.

CaliPharms is in discussions with its first CBD and THC customer "High Performance Beverage Co.", (OTC PINK: TBEV). CaliPharms long term goal is to be a leading supplier of CBD and THC components for cannabis related products. CaliPharms THC and CBD powder concentrates utilize a proprietary formulation process that is all natural and organic. The extraction process includes a filtration system of active carbon and ion exchange resins to ensure a clean, pure and consistent product. The final products are batch tested from two independent California labs for pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, and cannabinoid content.

CaliPharms CEO Bo Linton stated,  Our goal for CaliPharms is to be the standard in CBD and THC quality with predictable medical results from our cannabis products. If the label says 10 milligrams of THC or CBD, you will get the appropriate medical response. The health and well being of people are the most important factors for products carrying the CaliPharms name. Our products will be independently tested to give our customers the assurance they are getting the best CBD and THC available for their respective product lines. From coffee, to cookies, to drinks, and candies, every product should have an accurate dosage in milligrams. If the precise milligrams is not listed on the label, it probably isnt in the product. We believe people should know what they are paying for and we will back it with independently tested scientific data. Thats what will make CaliPharms stand apart and set the standard in the cannabis industry. CaliPharms prices are very competitive and current cannabis products makers should reach out to us to see if we can beat the prices they currently pay for CBD and THC concentrates.

If a Company would like to learn more about CaliPharms wholesale CBD and THC powders and sales please contact the company at info@calipharms.com. CaliPharms only conducts legalized medical cannabis business within the state of California.

Federal Cannabis Policy Update - According to Sen. Rand Paul, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has privately reassured Republican senators that he is not considering a major shift in marijuana enforcement after all. He told me he would have some respect for states' rights on these things. And so Ill be very unhappy if the federal government decides to go into Colorado and Washington and all of these places. And thats not the [what] my interpretation of my conversation with him was. That this wasnt his intention," said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in an interview.

During an opioid epidemic, medical marijuana is a safe, non-addictive option: Bruce Nicholson
And at least 16,500 NSAID-related deaths occur among arthritis patients alone. If the Center for Disease Control counted the number of fatal GI toxicity issues caused by NSAIDs in its National Vital Statistics report, it would be listed as the 15th most common cause of death in the United States.
