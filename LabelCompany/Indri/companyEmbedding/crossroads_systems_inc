Welcome to Crossroads Systems, Inc.















Company History



Crossroads was founded in 1996 by a team of individuals passionate about data storage. The Austin, Texas based team of engineers grew over the years and developed some of the storage industry’s most fundamental technology. Many of Crossroads’ patents became industry leading and award winning products. More than 50 companies have licensed Crossroads’ technology over the last 16 years, and we believe there are many more companies who would benefit from a licensing arrangement. We’re proud of the men and women who pioneered these innovations and created many of  the storage industry’s cutting edge products and services.
