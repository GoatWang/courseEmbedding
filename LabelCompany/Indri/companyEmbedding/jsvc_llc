                          I'm new to Linux and I was trying to install a package on a RHEL5 box and it's saying 
                          "line 67: /opt/jsvc/jsvc: No such file or directory

                          Where can I download jsvc to compile it and install it?

                                    Make sure your RH is connected to the Internet and run this as root

                                    yum install jsvc*
                                    yum install java*

                                    Looks like you are missing java package.

                                    the java seemed to be already on there...although there was an update but when I run for the jsvc I get:


                                    [root@server ~]# yum install jsvc*
                                    Loaded plugins: rhnplugin, security
                                    Setting up Install Process
                                    No package jsvc* available.
                                    Nothing to do

                                    Try this to see if jsvc is already install:

                                    yum list| grep jsvc

                                    if you see there is the package, it may be corrupted. You need to remove and reinstall it

                                    yum remove jsvc

                                    and install it with

                                    yum install jsvc*

                                    K

                                    Sometime, you have to run update prior to the installation. Ex:

                                    yum update jsvc*

                                    then

                                    yum install jsvc*

                                    K

                                    Sorry for the space issue on the first command when I am typing. It should be

                                    yum list | grep jsvc

                                    I believe jsvc is installed but corrupted. Try the list again

                                    K

                                    If the package is installed, you can run this command to verify:

                                    rpm -qa | grep jsvc

                                    if it returned nothing then the package is not installed. If it does return jsvc package, you can run

                                    yum remove jsvc*

                                    then install again with yum

                                    K

                                    Doesn't appear that it's installed but then if you try to install it through yum it won't. :(

                                    There are a few things that cause yum not working:
                                    - No internet connection
                                    - Not RHEL 5, maybe older RH version
                                    - No package avail for the that particular RH version.

                                    Please post the result of this command

                                    cat /etc/*release
                                    or 
                                    cat /proc/version

                                    K

                                    Have you registered with RH for downloading updates?
                                    If you haven't, yum won't work. You may have to manually install the jsvc package.

                                    when I said I'm new to Linux....not that new. :)

                                    Yes, the system is registered and I've run yum update successfully before so it is currently up to date with no patches showing to be installed.

                                    Sorry for the sanity check. Let me go back to the beginning to ensure we are on the same page. So the jsvc is not avail for redhat 5. I check this site and see it is only avail for fedora and rh4. 

http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3?stat=3&search=jakarta-commons-daemon-jsvc&srodzaj=3

http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/2604283/dir/redhat_other/com/jakarta-commons-daemon-jsvc-1.0.1-1jpp.i386.rpm.html

                                    You may have to try to use fedora package. If it does not work, you may need to run different rh or os.
