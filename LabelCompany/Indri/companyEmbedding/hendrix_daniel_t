Hendrix, Daniel T. - The Wall Street Transcript














































 





































Daniel T. Hendrix
DANIEL T. HENDRIX, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Interface, Inc., joined the company in 1983, shortly after its
initial public offering. He was quickly elevated from Financial
Manager to Treasurer and then to Chief Financial Officer in 1985.
Prior to joining Interface, he was employed by a multinational
public accounting firm as an Audit Manager for six years. Working
for the past 19 years at Ray Anderson’s side, Mr. Hendrix has led
Interface in a series of acquisitions, both domestic and
international, ranging in size from $2 million to $150 million.
Several of these acquisitions nearly doubled the company in size,
including the 1985 acquisition of Guilford of Maine, the leading
manufacturer of fabric for office systems furniture, and the 1988
acquisition of the largest carpet like manufacturer in the world,
Holland-based Heuga, which combined then-number two Interface
with then-number one Heuga and firmly established Interface as
the leader in that market segment. Mr. Hendrix graduated with
honors from Florida State University with a BS in Accounting in
1977.

Daniel T Hendrix
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Kentucky:













Does Daniel T Hendrix carry a valid contracting license?



Although the state of Kentucky does not require contractors to be licensed, local jurisdictions may have stricter regulations governing licensing. 
Daniel T Hendrix currently holds license ME15762 (Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring Daniel T Hendrix



Kentucky does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance. Regardless, it is advisable to hire contractors with active policies for both forms of insurance. Be sure to request a copy of the insurance certificates for your records.











Financial recourse when hiring Daniel T Hendrix



Kentucky does not require contractors to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file complaints with the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection department.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Kentucky, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Interface (NASDAQ:IFSIA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
