Jackson posted another photo of Prince George taken Friday on the last day of the family's trip to Germany.
Whether he's being sassy, a little shy, or totally hamming it up for the camera, Prince George is one of my favorite people on the planet.William and Kate, who are officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, returned to England with George and his sister, two-year-old Princess Charlotte, on Friday after five-day tour of Poland and Germany ahead of his birthday on Saturday.Kensington Palace said in a statement: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to share a new official portrait of Prince George to mark His Royal Highness's fourth birthday tomorrow".The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge brought their kids to the Europe tour, both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are members of the royal family and need to used to be at the centre of attention.
It's the first time the royals have released an official portrait of Prince George on his birthday.
Putin cut from 2 upcoming Hollywood movies due to hacking concerns
					He returned to the presidency in 2012 for another term and is legally entitled to serve for a fourth term as well. Plus, Sparrow's contemporary setting outright avoids Putin, who figured prominently in Matthews' novel.
				The photograph was taken at Kensington Palace at the end of June by Chris Jackson, Getty Images' royal photographer. It's pretty safe to say that a 4-year-old like George would rather stay home and play with his toys or enjoy and afternoon at the park with his nanny than travel with his parents.Charlotte has been wearing uncle Prince Harry's red shoes the entire royal tour.When William and Kate arrived in Warsaw on Monday, July 17, mischievous troublemaker Prince George tugged on his father's hand as he tried to get him to board their plane.He will go to Thomas's Battersea, a private preparatory school located a few miles from the family residence in Kensington Palace in London, where the family will be based.While Prince George is a very shy boy, her younger sister proved her ability to be a ideal princess who is not afraid of the signs of attention under any circumstances.

Tunc Doluca


 
 

Tunc Doluca

 
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS
Major and graduation year: Electrical Engineering, BS â79
Location: San Francisco, California
Rising to the top: In January 2007, alumnus Tunc Doluca was named president and CEO of Maxim Integrated Products, a Sunnyvale, California-based technology company. When Doluca joined Maxim Integrated Products as a Member of Technical Staff in 1984, he wanted to design circuits better than the competition that still met time-to-market goals. Once Doluca began to manage business units in the company, he realized that he eventually wanted to run a company.
Exciting accomplishments: Doluca, who has been with the company for over 25 years, has served a variety of rolesâfrom a member of the integrated circuit design development staff to group president for the Portable, Computing, and Instrumentation Electronics group. When Maxim was a still a small company, he was asked to be the general manager of their first vertical business unit, which started out with less than 25 employees, and with many years of teamwork, their sales grew from a modest $25 million to more than $600 million. Additionally, Doluca has designed over 40 products for Maxim, and he holds 11 mixed-signal design patents.
Enjoying his work: Doluca says that he most enjoys product planning, technology and product development, and organizing teams together to tackle tough product performance challenges that customers present to his company. Now that heâs the president and CEO, he plans to make Maxim a great companyâone that continues the legacy of innovation and develops value-added products for its customers.
