Our high-conviction strategies include these distinct approaches





Fundamental active
Portfolio managers choose investments based on the fundamental of a company and its stock or bond.



High conviction means assessing companies on how financially strong they are, not just how big they are.

Examining sector and factor performance in the third quarter of 2016
Posted by Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist on Sep. 26, 2016

The high beta, value and size factors outperformed the broad-market S&P 500 Index by a sizeable margin during the third quarter. The S&P 500 Index rose a healthy 3.85%, but 14 smart beta strategies and two smaller-cap indices all outperformed the broader market.

TORONTO, Jul 24, 2017 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- Assets to merge into Invesco Global Bond Fund  Invesco Canada ("Invesco") announced today that it has received Canadian unitholder approval for the merger of Invesco Emerging Markets Debt Fund (the "Terminating Fund") into Invesco Global Bond Fund (the "Continuing Fund").  The merger proposal was initially announced May 25, 2017. Unitholders approved the merger and termination at a special meeting held today in Toronto. The merger and termination are effective in Canada only.  The merger will be effective at the close of business on July 28, 2017. Assets held in most series of the Terminating Fund will be transferred to the corresponding series of the Continuing Fund. The exceptions are Series D and Series PTFU, which will be terminated immediately prior to the merger, as these series do not exist for the Continuing Fund.

About Invesco Ltd.Invesco Ltd. is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering an investment experience that helps people get more out of life. NYSE: IVZ; invesco.com.  Commissions, management fees and expenses may all be associated with investments in ETFs. ETFs are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated. Please read the prospectus before investing. Copies are available from Invesco Canada Ltd. at powershares.ca.  There are risks involved with investing in ETFs. Please read the prospectus for a complete description of risks relevant to the ETF. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply to purchases and sales of ETF units.  Most PowerShares ETFs seek to replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the applicable index, and are not actively managed. This means that the sub-advisor will not attempt to take defensive positions in declining markets and the ETF will continue to provide exposure to each of the securities in the index regardless of whether the financial condition of one or more issuers of securities in the index deteriorates. In contrast, if a PowerShares ETF is actively managed, then the sub-advisor has discretion to adjust that PowerShares ETF's holdings in accordance with the ETF's investment objectives and strategies.  ETFs are not diversified investments.  Investors should be aware of the risks associated with data sources and quantitative processes used in our investment management process. Errors may exist in data acquired from third-party vendors, the construction of model portfolios and in coding related to the index and portfolio construction process.

 Subject | Active management | Institutional | Trimark 


As active portfolio managers, we seek to identify and exploit inefficiencies in the marketplace. One major inefficiency, in my view, is the common fixation on earnings-based valuation metrics. Focusing on free cash flow, rather than net income, EBIT or EBITDA, allows us to find valuation arbitrage opportunities based on gaps in accounting earnings and free cash flow.

Market review: The global forces of disruption

Kristina Hooper


Global Market Strategist, Invesco Ltd.
  

July 18, 2017


 Subject | Institutional | Invesco | Macro views 


One of the key themes I’ve identified for 2017 and beyond is global disruption. Disruption can take many forms and be either a positive or negative force. The economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that disruption could be a positive force for economies – hence the term, “creative destruction.” Disruption – both positive and negative, both geopolitical and monetary – is abundant across the globe right now.

Mid-year market outlook: Canadian & world markets in 3D

Kristina Hooper


Global Market Strategist, Invesco Ltd.
  

July 14, 2017


 Subject | Institutional | Macro views 


Global stocks turned in a strong performance in the front half of 2017 despite geopolitical and monetary policy risks. The question, of course, is whether this performance trend can continue in the second half. I believe these two risks will cast an even longer shadow over markets going forward – making concepts such as diversification and risk management even more important for investors’ portfolios.

Up, up and away: BoC hikes rate

Brian Schneider


Senior Portfolio Manager, Head of North America Rates, Invesco Fixed Income†
  

July 12, 2017


 Subject | Institutional | Invesco | Invesco Fixed Income (IFI) | Macro views 


Following recent upbeat comments, the Bank of Canada (BoC) announced today that it would hike the overnight target rate to 0.75% from 0.50%. This is the first rate hike since 2010, as the BoC has become confident that the current “above potential growth” will continue, leading it to take back one of two emergency rate cuts enacted in 2015.

Interest-rate outlook: Expect rising rates in Canada

Brian Schneider


Senior Portfolio Manager, Head of North America Rates, Invesco Fixed Income†
  

July 4, 2017


 Subject | Institutional | Invesco | Invesco Fixed Income (IFI) | Macro views 


In June, Canadian 10-year government bond yields bounced off their lowest levels of the year, to 1.63%, as first quarter growth came in above expectations and central banks express confidence that monetary policy has accomplished it’s goal.1 The Bank of Canada (BoC), in particular, is less worried about uncertain U.S. trade policy and another substantial drop in oil prices, and becoming worried that excess capacity is beginning to dwindle. Their optimism may prove to be premature as inflation remains very low, so we are watching its stance closely. We expect interest rates in Canada to rise from current levels.

Headnote
National Policy 11-203 Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions -- Relief granted from s. 13.5(2)(b) of NI 31-103 based on exceptionally unique factual circumstances to permit portfolio manager to purchase illiquid securities from mutual fund to reduce risk of over-concentration -- Relief subject to conditions including IRC approval and objective pricing.
Applicable Legislative Provisions
National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements and Exemptions, ss. 13.5, 15.1.
November 15, 2012

IN THE MATTER OF
THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF
ONTARIO
(the Jurisdiction)
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
INVESCO CANADA LTD.
(the Filer)
DECISION
Background
The principal regulator in the Jurisdiction has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the principal regulator (the "Legislation") pursuant to section 15.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements and Exemptions ("NI 31-103"), exempting the Filer from the prohibition contained in subsection 13.5(2)(b) of NI 31-103 that prohibits a registered adviser from knowingly causing an investment portfolio managed by it, including an investment fund for which it acts as an adviser, to purchase or sell a security from or to the investment portfolio of a responsible person, an associate of a responsible person or an investment fund for which a responsible person acts as an adviser to permit the Filer or ICHI to purchase the Indian Securities from the Fund (the "Exemption Sought"):
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a passport application):

a. the Ontario Securities Commission is the principal regulator for this application;
b. the Filer has provided notice that section 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System ("MI 11-102") is intended to be relied upon in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon.

Interpretation
Defined terms contained in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions and MI 11-102 have the same meaning if used in this decision unless they are defined in this decision. The following additional terms shall have the following meanings:

"FII" means foreign institutional investor.
"Filer" means Invesco Canada Ltd.
"Fund" means Invesco Global Equity Fund.
"Indian Securities" means Camara Bank, Grasim Industries Ltd., Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. and Tata Motors Ltd. being issuers that trade on the NSE held by the Fund.
"ICHI" means Invesco Canada Holdings Inc.
"Invesco Intactive Portfolios" means Invesco Intactive Diversified Income Portfolio, Invesco Intactive Balanced Income Portfolio, Invesco Intactive Balanced Growth Portfolio and Invesco Intactive Maximum Growth Portfolio.
"NSE" means the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
"SEBI" means the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
"Termination Date" means on or about December 21, 2012.

Representations
1. The Filer (a) is a corporation amalgamated under the laws of Ontario; (b) is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., a global investment manager; (c) is not in default of applicable securities legislation in any jurisdiction; (d) has a head office located in Toronto, Ontario; and (e) is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada.
2. The Filer is the trustee and manager of the Fund and the Invesco Intactive Portfolios.
3. Invesco Advisers, Inc., an affiliate of the Filer, is the sub-advisor to the Fund and the Invesco Intactive Portfolios.
4. ICHI is (a) a corporation amalgamated under the laws of Ontario, and (b) a holding company not registered in any capacity in any province or territory of Canada. The Filer is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of ICHI.
5. The Filer is registered as an investment fund manager in Ontario and an adviser in the category of portfolio manager in all provinces of Canada.
6. The Fund is (a) a "mutual fund" and a "mutual fund in Ontario" as defined in the Securities Act (Ontario); and (b) sold pursuant to a simplified prospectus dated July 30, 2012, as amended (the "Prospectus").
7. The Fund currently invests in the Indian Securities which as of October 31, 2012 constituted in aggregate 0.51% of the net asset value of the Fund.
8. On July 19, 2012 SEBI provided notice to the Filer that its registration as a FII had lapsed and as a result all investment funds managed by the Filer must immediately cease trading in securities listed on the NSE, including sales of such securities ("Trade Prohibition").
9. Due to the Trade Prohibition, the Indian Securities are deemed illiquid securities for the Fund.
10. The Fund is an underlying fund to Invesco Intactive Portfolios.
11. The Filer has taken the following steps to announce the termination of the Fund effective the Termination Date:

(a) on October 1, 2012, the Filer issued a press release;
(b) on October 2, 2012, the Filer filed a material change report;
(c) on October 5, 2012, the Filer amended the Prospectus; and
(d) on October 16, 2012, notice of termination of the Fund was sent to all investors in the Fund.

12. As of October 31, 2012, the Invesco Intactive Portfolios owned approximately 94.43% of the Fund and an institutional investor owned approximately 5.05% of the Fund.
13. Effective November 15, 2012, the Invesco Intactive Portfolios will redeem their holdings of the Fund.
14. The Filer anticipates that following the redemption by the Invesco Intactive Portfolios, the Indian Securities will constitute approximately 9% of the net asset value of the Fund.
15. As at October 31, 2012 the average global equity fund available for purchase in Canada, had approximately 0.3% exposure to India (source Morningstar Research Inc.).
16. Accordingly, the Filer or ICHI propose to purchase the Indian Securities from the Fund based on the closing share price of those securities on the NSE on the date the Exemption Sought is granted ("Purchase Date").
17. The Filer or ICHI will pay the Fund the purchase price in cash in Canadian dollars on the Purchase Date. From the Purchase Date, the Fund will continue to retain legal ownership of the Indian Securities but will hold them in trust for the benefit of the Filer or ICHI, as the case may be (either of which will hold beneficial ownership), until such time as SEBI permits disposition of the Indian Securities. The purchase agreement will require the Fund to sell the Indian Securities upon receipt of permission from SEBI and to remit the proceeds of sale to the Filer or ICHI, as the case may be. As such, the Filer or ICHI may realize a gain or loss on the eventual sale of the Indian Securities and investors in the Fund will no longer have exposure to those investments as of the Purchase Date.
18. The Filer or ICHI will provide the Fund with an indemnity against any loss (excluding any forgone gain associated with an increase in the value of the Indian Securities between the Purchase Date and the date the Trade Prohibition is lifted) suffered as a result of the sale of the Indian Securities to the Filer or ICHI.
19. In the absence of the Exemption Sought neither the Filer nor ICHI would be permitted to purchase the Indian Securities from the Fund.
20. The Filer referred the purchase of the Indian Securities to the Fund's independent review committee ("IRC") at a meeting held on Thursday, November 15, 2012. The IRC approved the transaction on the basis set out herein and after making the determinations provided under sub-section 5.2(2) of National Instrument 81-107 -- Independent Review Committee for Investment Funds.
21. The Filer believes that the Exemption Sought is in the best interests of the Fund and investors of the Fund.
Decision
The principal regulator is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the principal regulator to make the decision.
The decision of the principal regulator is that the Exemption Sought is granted provided that the:

(a) Indian Securities are sold to the Filer or ICHI on the Purchase Date;
(b) price at which the Indian Securities are sold to the Filer or ICHI is the closing price of the Indian Securities on the NSE on the Purchase Date;
(c) Filer or ICHI shall provide the Fund with an indemnity against any loss it may suffer as a result of the sale of the Indian Securities to the Filer and ICHI except any forgone gain associated with the increase in value of the Indian Securities between the Purchase Date and the date the Trade Prohibition is lifted.
