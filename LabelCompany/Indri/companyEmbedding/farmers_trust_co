Social Security Break-Even CalculatorFull retirement age6667Monthly benefit at age 62$Monthly benefit at full retirement age$Monthly benefit at age 70$
    What is the best age to start receiving Social Security retirement benefits? To help make that decision, this calculator 
    compares the cumulative Social Security retirement benefits paid beginning at three different starting ages, and estimates 
    how long it takes for the cumulative benefits begun at a later age to equal or "break even" with the cumulative benefits 
    begun at an earlier age.
    
    The total cumulative benefits you receive can be affected by a number of factors, including the age at which you begin 
    receiving benefits and how long you live.  
    
You can use the Retirement Estimator calculator available at the  Social Security Administration's website (www.ssa.gov)
to calculate your monthly benefit amounts. Full retirement age (FRA) is between 66 and 67, depending on your birth date. Refer 
to the table below to determine your FRA.  While your actual FRA may fall in the middle of a calendar year, for this calculator, 
use age 66 if you were born between 1942 and 1957. If you were born in 1958 or later, use age 67.
	Full Retirement AgeIf you were born in:Your full retirement age is:1943-195466195566 and 2 months195666 and 4 months195766 and 6 months195866 and 8 months195966 and 10 months1960 or later67




Social Security Break-Even Calculator ChartsThis chart compares the cumulative benefits received over 30 years, beginning at age 62.After 10 years, the cumulative benefits paid, based on your starting age, are: 62-$180,000; 66-$144,000; 70-$52,800After 20 years: 62-$360,000; 66-$384,000; 70-$316,800After 30 years: 62-$540,000; 66-$624,000; 70-$580,800This chart shows the approximate age when cumulative benefits started at a later age will equal or "break even" with cumulative benefits begun at an earlier age. If you delay receiving benefits until age 70, it takes 18 years, or until age 87, to break even with benefits begun at age 62, but it takes 0 years, or until age 0,  to break even with benefits begun at age 66. Benefits begun at age 66, take 12 years, or until age 77 to break even with benefits begun at age 62.View TableStart OverAssumptions
        Social Security retirement income is illustrated based on your inputs. Actual Social Security benefits may differ,
        depending on your earnings history and other factors, such as actual government cost-of-living adjustments.
      
        These results are hypothetical, and are for illustrative purposes only.
      
        All monthly benefits are presumed to be paid over a 12-month calendar year,  although	benefits actually paid in
        the first year of election are often paid over a period shorter than 12 months.
      
        Taxes are not factored into the calculation of cumulative benefits.

Farmers Trust and Savings Bank












President’s Message


Welcome! Farmers Bank has been serving the Spencer area – customers and community – since 1916 with a reputation for excellence in personal service. Much has changed since the bank was founded, in that customers now have the option to do much of their banking electronically. Services such as NetTeller Online Banking, Online Bill Payment, and Mobile Banking make it easy and convenient to do your banking wherever you are, whenever you like. One thing has stayed the same. Customers who choose to do their banking in person (all the time, some of the time, or once in a while) still get the personal service and attention that we’ve been known for. As we celebrate our 100th Anniversary, we reflect what an accomplishment and milestone that really is. We are a unique company and financial institution. I hope you will join us in our celebration and be part of the many activities we have planned. Without you, our loyal and faithful staff, friends and clients, we would not be what we are today. Thank you very much for your continued support!If you have any questions or concerns, we’re here to listen and help. Please call or come in to visit with me or any of our bank officers or personal bankers, or contact us online.In the meantime, thanks for visiting our website. Whether you’re a new visitor or a long-time customer, we’re glad you’re here.Dave WoodcockPresident & CEO

Direct Check Debit Card
Why carry cash or a bulky checkbook when one little card can do it all? Go direct with Direct Check - The Farmers State Bank and Trust Company's debit card. Direct Check is like writing an electronic check because the amount of your purchase is deducted from your checking account.

Direct Check doesnt charge you interest when you make a purchase and you can use it at over 12 million locations worldwide, wherever you see the Visa Symbol!
E-mail, call, or stop by our Customer Service Department to request your Direct Check card today!


Reserve CheckingWhen you open a Reserve Checking account at Farmers, a cash reserve is set aside to draw on whenever the need arises… so, unexpected household expenses, medical bills, even special buys on furniture or appliances are no problem. 

          When you write a check larger then the balance of you account, we transfer funds automatically from your cash reserve (in multiples of $100) into your account to cover the check.  Just by writing a check, you've written yourself a loan instantly, with no "red tape" and confidentially, too.
Reserve Checking costs nothing until you use it. Repayments are simple, too, because they're deducted automatically from your checking account. You'll love this convenient aid to family money management. For more information, or to apply for Reserve Checking call (217) 479-4123. 


Overdraft Protection TransferAvoid the worry and embarrassment of an overdraft by requesting Overdraft Protection Transfer. This service offers you the ability to designate a transfer account for use in obtaining funds when an overdraft situation might otherwise occur. 

          For example, your checking account is short of funds, but your transfer account has ample funds to cover the expense. With Overdraft Protection Transfer, funds are automatically transferred from that designated account to your checking account so an overdraft does not occur. The transfer is only made between accounts designated by you and only when an overdraft situation would occur.
The cost for this service is $3.00 per transfer, only when the system is used. Balance and activity limitations on savings and money market accounts apply. E-mail, call or stop by Customer Service to obtain an application.

								A deposit of $100.00 is required to open the account. After opening the account, the customer may deposit any amount at any time.  Interest is paid quarterly.

The account is available to any child 5-12 years of age. He/she must have a new or existing savings account at the Bank. The account is unaffected by membership status. The club is an optional benefit for having the account.
