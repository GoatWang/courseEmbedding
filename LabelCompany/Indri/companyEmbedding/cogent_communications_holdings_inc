Home | About Cogent





   

   


			Overview of Cogent		
Cogent is a multinational Tier 1 Internet Service Provider consistently ranked as one of the top five networks in the world. Our primary service offering consists of Internet access and data transport, offered over our award-winning fiber optic, IP data-only network, along with colocation in any of our 53 Internet data centers. We service two customer segments: "Corporate" (small businesses to Fortune 100 companies) and "NetCentric" (Carriers / Service Providers and Application / Content Providers, whose businesses rely primarily on Internet access).
Our innovative, facilities-based network spans across North America, across the Atlantic throughout Europe, and across the Pacific to Asia. With over 57,200 route miles of intercity fiber and more than 30,190 metro fiber miles, we provide service to over 198 major markets and interconnect with over 5,940 other networks.
Cogent was founded on the premise that bandwidth can be treated like a commodity—produce mass amounts and position it for sale based on price. Leveraging new technologies, we built our own IP data network independent of the traditional voice-based networks owned by the RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies). By doing so, we believed we could reduce the cost of high quality bandwidth down to a level never before offered in the marketplace. Less than five years after lighting our network backbone, we have become widely recognized as one of the largest carriers of Internet traffic in the world.
We stand apart from our competitors in many areas, but key differentiators include:

Our customer connections are dedicated and non-oversubscribed
Our prices are the lowest in the industry
Our diversity from traditional carriers enables redundancy for customer data
Our simple network structure allows for rapid provisioning
Our 'self-healing' ring architecture design minimizes outages
Cogent is Smart Business Internet

Cogent Communications is a public company trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CCOI. Cogent is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States of America.

Acquisition history[edit]
Cogent was founded in 1999 at the peak of the industry's growth.[5] In three years, Cogent acquired 13 other failing carriers, purchasing $14 billion in capital for $60 million, including $4 billion worth of Property, Plant and Equipment.[6]

September 2001 – Acquires the assets of NetRail[5]
February 2002 – Acquires Allied Riser[7][8]
April 2002 – Acquires Building Access Agreements from OnSite Access
April 2002 – Acquires Major US Assets of PSINet[9]
September 2002 – Acquires Major Assets of FiberCity Networks
February 2003 – Acquires Fiber Network Solutions[10]
May 2003 – Acquires Assets of Applied Theory
January 2004 – Acquires LambdaNet France & Spain[11]
March 2004 – Acquires Fiber Network and Equipment in Germany Out of Former Carrier1 Assets[12]
September 2004 – Acquires Global Access[13]
October 2004 – Acquires Aleron Broadband[14]
December 2004 – Acquires NTT/Verio Dedicated Access Business in U.S.[15]

Peering[edit]
Cogent has been controversial in the ISP market for low bandwidth pricing and its public disputes over peering with AOL (2003),[16] France Telecom (2006),[17] Level 3 Communications (2005),[18] TeliaSonera (March 2008)[19] and Sprint Nextel (October 2008).[20]
On March 14, 2008, after Cogent stopped routing packets from European network provider Telia (AS 1299), their two networks lost mutual connectivity.[19] The connection was reestablished March 28, 2008 with interconnection points in both the United States and Europe.[21]
On June 6, 2011, Cogent automatically stopped peering with The Department of Energy Sciences Network (ESnet)[22] causing a disruption for 3 days.
Cogent has yet to agree on peering with one of the biggest IPv6 connectivity providers, Hurricane Electric. As of March 2016, direct connectivity between the two networks is impossible.[23] Cogent and Google have also stopped IPv6 peering in 2016.[24] This is rumored to be closely tied to Cogent leveraging Google's IPv4 traffic via a paid customer or to maintain SFI with another network.[25]
In February 2017, Cogent blocked many pirating and streaming sites including The Pirate Bay.[26] This was unintentional due to a poorly crafted Spanish court order.[27]

Acquisition history[edit]
Cogent was founded in 1999 at the peak of the industry's growth.[5] In three years, Cogent acquired 13 other failing carriers, purchasing $14 billion in capital for $60 million, including $4 billion worth of Property, Plant and Equipment.[6]

September 2001 – Acquires the assets of NetRail[5]
February 2002 – Acquires Allied Riser[7][8]
April 2002 – Acquires Building Access Agreements from OnSite Access
April 2002 – Acquires Major US Assets of PSINet[9]
September 2002 – Acquires Major Assets of FiberCity Networks
February 2003 – Acquires Fiber Network Solutions[10]
May 2003 – Acquires Assets of Applied Theory
January 2004 – Acquires LambdaNet France & Spain[11]
March 2004 – Acquires Fiber Network and Equipment in Germany Out of Former Carrier1 Assets[12]
September 2004 – Acquires Global Access[13]
October 2004 – Acquires Aleron Broadband[14]
December 2004 – Acquires NTT/Verio Dedicated Access Business in U.S.[15]

Peering[edit]
Cogent has been controversial in the ISP market for low bandwidth pricing and its public disputes over peering with AOL (2003),[16] France Telecom (2006),[17] Level 3 Communications (2005),[18] TeliaSonera (March 2008)[19] and Sprint Nextel (October 2008).[20]
On March 14, 2008, after Cogent stopped routing packets from European network provider Telia (AS 1299), their two networks lost mutual connectivity.[19] The connection was reestablished March 28, 2008 with interconnection points in both the United States and Europe.[21]
On June 6, 2011, Cogent automatically stopped peering with The Department of Energy Sciences Network (ESnet)[22] causing a disruption for 3 days.
Cogent has yet to agree on peering with one of the biggest IPv6 connectivity providers, Hurricane Electric. As of March 2016, direct connectivity between the two networks is impossible.[23] Cogent and Google have also stopped IPv6 peering in 2016.[24] This is rumored to be closely tied to Cogent leveraging Google's IPv4 traffic via a paid customer or to maintain SFI with another network.[25]
In February 2017, Cogent blocked many pirating and streaming sites including The Pirate Bay.[26] This was unintentional due to a poorly crafted Spanish court order.[27]

In February 2017, Cogent blocked many pirating and streaming sites including The Pirate Bay.[26] This was unintentional due to a poorly crafted Spanish court order.[27]

Cogent Communications is a multinational internet service provider based in the United States. Cogent's primary services consist of Internet access and data transport, offered on fiber optic, IP data-only network, along with colocation in data centers.[2]
Cogent's AS (174) has one of the highest-ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[3][4]

Acquisition history[edit]
Cogent was founded in 1999 at the peak of the industry's growth.[5] In three years, Cogent acquired 13 other failing carriers, purchasing $14 billion in capital for $60 million, including $4 billion worth of Property, Plant and Equipment.[6]

September 2001 – Acquires the assets of NetRail[5]
February 2002 – Acquires Allied Riser[7][8]
April 2002 – Acquires Building Access Agreements from OnSite Access
April 2002 – Acquires Major US Assets of PSINet[9]
September 2002 – Acquires Major Assets of FiberCity Networks

May 2003 – Acquires Assets of Applied Theory

September 2004 – Acquires Global Access[13]
October 2004 – Acquires Aleron Broadband[14]
December 2004 – Acquires NTT/Verio Dedicated Access Business in U.S.[15]

Peering[edit]
Cogent has been controversial in the ISP market for low bandwidth pricing and its public disputes over peering with AOL (2003),[16] France Telecom (2006),[17] Level 3 Communications (2005),[18] TeliaSonera (March 2008)[19] and Sprint Nextel (October 2008).[20]
On March 14, 2008, after Cogent stopped routing packets from European network provider Telia (AS 1299), their two networks lost mutual connectivity.[19] The connection was reestablished March 28, 2008 with interconnection points in both the United States and Europe.[21]
On June 6, 2011, Cogent automatically stopped peering with The Department of Energy Sciences Network (ESnet)[22] causing a disruption for 3 days.
Cogent has yet to agree on peering with one of the biggest IPv6 connectivity providers, Hurricane Electric. As of March 2016, direct connectivity between the two networks is impossible.[23] Cogent and Google have also stopped IPv6 peering in 2016.[24] This is rumored to be closely tied to Cogent leveraging Google's IPv4 traffic via a paid customer or to maintain SFI with another network.[25]
In February 2017, Cogent blocked many pirating and streaming sites including The Pirate Bay.[26] This was unintentional due to a poorly crafted Spanish court order.[27]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
