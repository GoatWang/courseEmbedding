                        APPROACH

3G Capital's strategy is to identify and invest in opportunities that are well-positioned
                            for profitable, long-term growth and success across a variety of different sectors
                            and regions. The firm's management team leverages prior investment experience, industry
                            expertise and an extensive global network to successfully implement this strategy.
3G Capital's core management philosophy focuses on developing and retaining top
                            tier talent.
3G Capital and its affiliates have particular expertise in the retail and consumer
                            sector and consistently evaluate new opportunities for successful investments in
                            this industry.
In order to preserve capital and maximize value, 3G Capital believes that factoring
                            in the downside of an investment is equally as important as the upside potential.
                            This philosophy has helped the firm weather various global economic cycles.
3G Capital operates as a true partnership with strong meritocracy, and therefore
                            there is significant alignment of interests among 3G Capital's Principals & Partners
                            and relevant management teams.

3G Capital's Brands Lose Market Share Amid Focus on Costs

  3G Capital Partners LP is known for wringing costs out of food-and-beverage businesses. Its track record for boosting sales and market share of their products is less stellar. 

  The Brazilian private-equity firm is currently embarked on its biggest challenge, integrating the former Kraft Foods Group into the Heinz business that 3G bought two years ago with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 

                  Kraft Heinz Co., formed last month, owns many of the most recognized food names in America?including eight brands with more than $1 billion in annual sales, among them Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, and Velveeta. But many of the company's brands are struggling to keep up with consumers' shift  toward less-processed fare. 

  Some analysts think 3G could take on even more acquisitions. Activist investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management LP last week revealed that it had  built a $5.5 billion, 7.5% stake in Mondelez International Inc., betting in part that it might eventually be acquired by Kraft Heinz. 

  A Wall Street Journal examination of the companies 3G and its founders already have invested in, which also include Burger King and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, shows impressive increases in profit margins, but mixed performances on sales growth?other than that which comes from more acquisitions. 

  Since 3G bought Heinz two years ago, for example, the ketchup maker lost market share in 65% of the food categories in which it has brands, maintained share in 16%, and gained in less than 20%, according to a February report by McKinsey & Co. 

  Heinz has had only two major product launches in the U.S. in its two years under 3G. In February, it unveiled Sriracha-flavored ketchup, and in April it announced a consumer version of the yellow mustard it has long sold to bulk retailers and food-service customers like ballparks. 

  3G hasn't "done anything revolutionary or groundbreaking that worked" with Heinz products, said David Turner, food analyst at market researcher Mintel. 

  A spokesman for 3G Capital said the global investment firm focuses on long-term with a particular emphasis on maximizing the potential of brands and businesses. He added that the firm works in close partnership with management teams at its portfolio companies. 

  Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said its strategy is "focused growth that emphasizes fewer, bigger, better innovations," and it has increased advertising media spending by 30% over the past two years, including Heinz's first Super Bowl commercial in decades in 2014. 

  Part of the issue is priorities, say people who follow 3G. It focuses on reducing spending through cutting staff and increasing efficiency, and only then focuses on growth, says a consultant who has worked with the firm. 

  3G's spending cuts generally far exceed typical belt tightening.  Its use of zero-based budgeting, which requires justifying all spending from scratch annually, yields detailed savings measures, such as limits on color printing and requiring executives to share hotel rooms on business trips. The firm says such penny pinching yields savings that it invests in products and marketing. 

  As it scrutinizes costs, 3G also evaluates which of its brands are worth investing in. At Heinz, executives reallocated money to core products like its namesake ketchup from less promising ones, like Heinz's bottled gravy, and discontinued dozens of unsuccessful items. 

  While Heinz has gained market share with ketchup and its Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce since 2013, it lost share in areas that include Bagel Bites frozen snacks and Classico pasta sauce, according to market-research firm IRI. Its sales fell $322 million to $2.48 billion in the first quarter this year, but operating income rose 17% to $508.5 million. Kraft Heinz reports second-quarter results for its two predecessor companies on Monday. 

  At Kraft, 3G's approach could mean less investment in brands like Jell-O and Maxwell House as it focuses on core moneymakers like Oscar Mayer, analysts say. 

  3G's strategy brings potential long-term downsides. The McKinsey report, while noting that the firm has "created tremendous operational value," warns that its "focus on short-term profitability and cash flows does pose risks to brand health, particularly to future growth." McKinsey declined to comment further. 

  3G emphasizes its desire to grow companies, but its main means for that so far has been more deals. Burger King, which 3G bought in 2010, last year acquired Canada's Tim Hortons chain to form Restaurant Brands International Inc. AB InBev has purchased Grupo Modelo, maker of Corona beer, and craft breweries including Chicago's Goose Island. 

  At Burger King, sales at restaurants open at least 13 months have risen at a respectable average of 1.9% over the past three years, though that followed a rocky start with a poorly executed menu overhaul. 

  The company has stumbled with some products. It eliminated its chicken fries only to bring them back two years later because of popular demand. In 2013 it introduced Satisfries, lower-calorie french fries, which were discontinued within a year. 

  Other than that, "I haven't seen a whole lot out of Burger King in terms of food innovation since 3G came in," said a Burger King franchise operator who also owns stock in Restaurant Brands. Still, he isn't complaining: Restaurant Brands' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 14.3% to $761 million last year, excluding Tim Hortons. 

  Burger King and Heinz also have focused on international expansion, which Heinz has said could also benefit Kraft. 

  "The business is being driven by listening to consumers and delivering what they want. Innovation for the sake of innovation isn't the key driver of our business," a Restaurant Brands spokesman said. 

  3G doesn't own AB InBev, but its founding partners own large stakes after helping create it through a 2008 merger. 

  Operating income at AB InBev has grown by an average of 8.6% a year in its five years under 3G, according to A.T. Kearney. But it has lost 4.1 percentage points of its share of the U.S. beer market since its formation, according to industry tracker Beer Marketer's Insights. 

  AB InBev's product innovations have had limited success. It launched a margarita-flavored beer in 2012 called Bud Light Lime-a-Rita, sales of which initially surged, but recently collapsed. Chief Executive Carlos Brito said last month that revenue per barrel of beer in the second quarter was lower because of the Rita franchise's struggles. Sales of AB InBev beverage coolers, which includes the franchise, fell 23% at retail during the 12 weeks ending July 4, according to Nielsen data cited by Cowen & Co. 

  An AB InBev spokeswoman said it is committed to stabilizing its market share in the U.S., and that with seven of the world's top 10 beer brands, it has delivered strong commercial results in most of its top markets. She said the involvement of 3G's founding partners "drives a certain degree of best practices exchange and cultural similarities" with the private-equity firm.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

History[edit]
3G Capital was founded in 2004. The firm is best known for partnering up with Berkshire Hathaway for its acquisitions, including those of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Kraft Foods.
Notable deals[edit]
In 2010, the company acquired Burger King for $3.3 billion, and subsequently took the company private. The deal was announced in September 2010, and was finalized in November.[5] Shareholders received $24.00 per share in cash.[5] Under new management, Burger King introduced a reworked menu and marketing strategies.[6] In June 2012, Burger King was once again listed as a publicly traded company through a $1.4 billion deal with Justice Holdings. Despite the relisting, 3G Capital retained a 71% stake of the company.[6]
In December 2014, the Canadian federal government approved the purchase of Tim Hortons by 3G Capital for $12.5 billion. The acquisition merged Burger King with Tim Hortons as Restaurant Brands International.[7]
On 25 March 2015, it was announced that 3G Capital was in "advanced talks" to buy Kraft Foods for $40 billion, and merge it with Heinz to create the world's fifth largest food company.[8][9] Heinz was being advised in the transaction by Lazard and Kraft by Centerview Partners.[10]
Offices and management[edit]
3G Capital has offices in New York City, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and the firm is run by managing partner Alex Behring out of New York.[11][12] Affiliates of the firm and its partners have control or partial ownership stakes in global companies such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Lojas Americanas, the largest non-food and online retailer in Latin America, and América Latina Logística, the largest railroad and logistics company in Latin America.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
