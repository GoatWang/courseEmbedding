BNP Paribas Asset Management 








 

The asset manager for a changing world
A changing world offers many opportunities.  It also comes with challenges that develop our abilities and test our ambitions, perspectives and determination.






 

Our approach to responsibility
At BNP Paribas Asset Management we’re working towards a world where all investing is responsible. For us, investing responsibly isn’t just about embracing the social values and global concerns we share with our clients, it’s about investing in a brighter future that delivers long-term rewards for both our clients and future generations.






 

Our expertise
We believe that listening is central to our goal of providing quality investment solutions for our clients, and building strong, lasting partnerships based on confidence and trust.  Only through listening can we understand our clients’ objectives, enabling the design and recommendation of relevant – and often bespoke, investment solutions.  We manage a range of active investment strategies – both fundamental and quantitative, in addition to strategies managed to replicate specific indices and benchmarks – across a wide universe of assets extending from equities, fixed income, multi-asset and LDI solutions to alternatives.  






 

Our talents and diversity
The world is changing every day, so as a leading asset manager we can’t afford to look at what’s going on through a single lens. Opportunities and risks would be too easy to miss in such a complex environment.
