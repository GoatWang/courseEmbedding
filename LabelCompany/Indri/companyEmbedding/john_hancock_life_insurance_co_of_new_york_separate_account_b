 SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT
 EXTENDED NO-LAPSE GUARANTEE RIDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This rider is part of the policy to which it is attached in consideration of the
application and charges for this rider. It takes effect at the same time as your
policy. Except where the rider provides otherwise, it is subject to all the     
provisions of your policy. While this rider is in effect, we reserve the right  
to restrict availability of certain Investment Accounts, in which case no       
transfers or payments may be allocated to such restricted Investment Accounts.  
The Investment Accounts which are available and those which are restricted while
this rider is in effect are specified in the allocation section of your         
application. However, should a transfer be effected in error to a restricted    
Investment Account, upon discovery of such error, we will notify you accordingly
that you have 30 days to re-allocate the subject funds out of the restricted    
Investment Account into an available Investment Account. If you fail to make a  
corrective re-allocation, this rider will terminate at the end of such 30 day   
period.                                                                         

BENEFIT PERIOD                                                                  
This benefit applies to your policy for the duration shown in the Policy        
Specifications section for this rider.                                          

BENEFIT COST                                                                    
The monthly cost for this benefit is included as part of the Monthly Deduction  
under your policy. It is shown in the Policy Specifications section for this    
rider.                                                                          

BENEFIT                                                                         
This benefit extends the No-Lapse Guarantee Period provided by your policy for  
the Base Face Amount. The Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Period applicable to the  
policy is shown in the Policy Specifications section for this rider. Provided   
this benefit is in effect, we guarantee that during this extended period, your  
policy will not go into default if the Net Cash Surrender Value falls to zero or
below provided the policy satisfies an Extended Cumulative Premium Test as      
described below.                                                                

EXTENDED CUMULATIVE PREMIUM TEST                                                
This test will be performed on any Processing Date during the Extended No-Lapse 
Guarantee Period that your policy would otherwise be in default in the absence  
of this rider. Your policy will satisfy the test if the sum of the premiums     
received, less any Policy Debt, and less any withdrawals, taken on or before the
date of any test; is equal to or greater than the sum of the monthly Extended   
No-Lapse Guarantee Premiums due from the Policy Date to the date of the test.   
The test will exclude any period during which the Life Insured was totally      
disabled if the Total Disability Waiver Of Monthly Deductions Rider             
Supplementary Benefit is included in the policy. The Extended No-Lapse Guarantee
Premium is shown as an annualized amount in the Table of Values in Section 1 of 
the policy. The monthly Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Premium is one twelfth of   
this annualized amount.                                                         

The Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Premium may change if any of the following      
changes occur under your policy:                                                

    (a)     you add, terminate, or change a Supplementary Benefit rider;
(b)     you change the Death Benefit Option under your policy;  
     (c)     there is a change in the Base Face Amount or the Supplemental
Face Amount of the policy; or                   
    (d)     there is a change in the Life Insured's Risk Classification.

We will inform you of any change to the Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Premium     
resulting from any such change. The revised premium will be effective from the  
date of the change. For the purpose of performing the Extended Cumulative       
Premium Test, we will use the Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Premiums in effect as 
of the Policy Date up to the date of the change, including any revised premiums 
in effect as of the date of a prior change.                                     

                                                                     (continued)

GRACE PERIOD                                                                    
The Grace Period provision of the policy applies to this rider as well. However,
while this rider is in effect, if the policy is in the Extended No-Lapse        
Guarantee Period, and the Extended Cumulative Premium Test has been met, then   
the Base Face Amount will remain in effect, but any Supplemental Face Amount and
any Supplementary Benefit riders (unless otherwise stated therein) will be      
subject to termination. The amount required to maintain any Supplemental Face   
Amount and any applicable Supplementary Benefit riders is equal to the Default  
Payment specified in the Grace Period provision of the policy. If a payment at  
least equal to the Default Payment is not received by the end of the Grace      
Period, then any Supplemental Face Amount, and any Supplementary Benefit riders 
(unless otherwise stated therein), will cease to be in effect and will be       
terminated from the policy.                                                     

Failure to Meet Extended Cumulative Premium Test                                
If the policy is in the Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Period, and the Extended    
Cumulative Premium Test has not been met, then the Base Face Amount, any        
Supplemental Face Amount, and any Supplementary Benefit riders will go into     
default, as described in the Grace Period provision of the policy. The Grace    
Period Duration and Default Payment provisions described in the policy will     
apply. In lieu of the Default Payment, however, you may pay the shortfall needed
to meet the Extended Cumulative Premium Test, in which case the Base Face Amount
will remain in effect, but any Supplemental Face Amount and any Supplementary   
Benefit riders (unless otherwise stated therein) will terminate as of the end of
the Grace Period. The shortfall will be equal to the amount necessary to satisfy
the Extended Cumulative Premium Test as of the date of default, plus the        
Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Premium for the next three Policy Months.           

TERMINATION                                                                     
This rider terminates at the earliest of:                                       

      (a)     the end of the Extended No-Lapse Guarantee Period shown in the
Policy Specifications section for this rider;   

   (b)     the end of the Grace Period for which you have not paid the
      amount necessary to bring this benefit out of default;

   (c)     the end of the 30 day period from the date we notify you of
               discovery that a transfer was effected in error to a restricted
               Investment Account and you do not re-allocate the subject funds
          out of the restricted Investment Account into an available
Investment Account;                             

(d)     the date your policy terminates;                        

        (e)     the date we receive your written request for termination of this
rider.                                          

This rider cannot be reinstated after it terminates.

Changes to Prospectus and Statements of Additional Information 
This Supplement applies to VENTURE® OPPORTUNITY A SHARE VARIABLE ANNUITY and VENTURE® OPPORTUNITY B SHARE VARIABLE ANNUITY Contracts issued by John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) or John Hancock Life Insurance Company of New York (the Contracts). It
supplements the prospectus for the Contract you purchased (the Annuity Prospectus) and statement of additional information (SAI) dated April 29, 2013. 
 
You should read this Supplement together with the Annuity Prospectus and retain all documents for future reference. We define
certain terms in this Supplement. If a term is not defined in this Supplement, it has the meaning given to it in the Annuity Prospectus. If you would like another copy of the Annuity Prospectus or SAI, please contact our Annuities Service Center at 1-800-344-1029, or in New York State at 1-800-551-2078 to request a free copy. You may also visit our website at www.jhannuities.com or

IRS Guidance on Same-Sex Spouses 
On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, following the U.S. Supreme Courts decision in United
States v. Windsor, jointly announced the issuance of Revenue Ruling 2013-17 (the Ruling), providing guidance on the federal taxation of same-sex couples. Windsor invalidated, on equal protection grounds, the limitation of
marriage to opposite-sex couples in the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Ruling holds that for all federal tax purposes, including income, gift and estate tax, the IRS will recognize same-sex marriages that are legally valid
in the state where the couple married, regardless of whether the state in which the couple resides would recognize the marriage.  At this time the Ruling
may not be relied upon retroactively with respect to matters relating to Qualified Plans. The IRS has promised future guidance on how Windsor and the Ruling will apply to Qualified Plans for periods prior to September 16, 2013, the
effective date of the Ruling. Presumably, this will include guidance on how to apply the spousal continuation rule of Code section 72(s)(3) to non-qualified annuities and the minimum required distribution rules of Code section 401(a)(9) to
Individual Retirement Accounts and Annuities, 403(b) annuities and Qualified Plans. The Ruling indicates that future guidance will take into account the impact of 
retroactivity on all taxpayers involved, including Qualified Plans, plan sponsors, employers, employees and affected Beneficiaries, and will provide sufficient
time for Qualified Plans to be amended and corrected as necessary to preserve existing favorable tax treatment.  In view of these developments, you should
disregard all references in the Annuity Prospectus to the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as applied to same-sex marriages. DOMA still affects the federal tax status of same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships. For Federal
tax purposes, the term marriage does not include registered domestic partnerships, civil unions, or other similar formal relationships recognized under state law that are not denominated as a marriage under that states law. You
should consult with a qualified financial advisor and/or tax advisor for additional information on your states regulations regarding civil unions and same-sex marriages. 
We revise the Annuity Prospectus as follows:  A
new definition of spouse is inserted in the Annuity Prospectus Glossary:  Spouse: Any person recognized as a
spouse in the state where the couple was legally married. The term does not include a party to a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar formal relationship recognized under state law that is not denominated as a
marriage under that states law.  The following sections of the Annuity Prospectus are deleted: 
In the Spouse section under V. Description of the Contract, the sections entitled Federal Definition of
Spouse and State Variations.  Under Appendix C: Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Riders, the section
entitled Civil Union and Same-Sex Marriage Partners.  We revise the SAI as follows: 
The section entitled State Variations Regarding Recognition of Same-Sex Couples is deleted. 
This Supplement replaces the Supplement dated October 7, 2013. 
You should retain this Supplement for future reference. 
Supplement dated November 4, 2013
