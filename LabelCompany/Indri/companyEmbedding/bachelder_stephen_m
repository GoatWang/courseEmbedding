Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Movers & Shakers Interview with Steve Bachelder, COO, Lakeland Industries, Inc.


     
       Published: 3 Oct 2014
     



Interviewed by Sanjiv Bhaskar, Vice President of Research


Background











Stephen M. Bachelder has served as Lakeland's chief operating officer since November 2012 and as a director since 2004. From February 2011 to November 2012, he served as chairman of the board of directors. From March 2011 until November 2012 he served as national sales manager. Bachelder was president of Swiftview, Inc., a Portland, Oregon-based software company, from 1999 to 2007. Swiftview, Inc. was sold to a private equity firm in October 2006. From 1991 to 1999, Bachelder ran a consulting firm advising technology companies in the Pacific Northwest. Bachelder was the president and owner of an apparel company, Bachelder Imports, from 1982 to 1991 and worked in executive positions for Giant Foods, Inc. and Pepsico, Inc. between 1976 and 1982. Bachelder is a 1976 graduate of the Harvard Business School.


Sanjiv Bhaskar: How do define leadership from your perspective?


Stephen M. Bachelder: Market share, innovation, reputation and things like quality of service, quality of people and growth.


SB: How do you describe Lakeland's role in the industry?


SMB: We are leaders in all the markets that we compete in. We believe we are the largest manufacturers of protective clothing in the world because we pretty much make all our own products while others use contractors. I think we have an excellent reputation for quality products and service as a good business partner. Very few customers would ever think that we did not treat them right. I believe in that. The best measure for that is customer loyalty. That really helped us in recovering from loss of the DuPont license a few years ago. People were willing to give us a chance. If not for that goodwill out there, it would have been a tougher deal for us.


SB: I think it is highly commendable that Lakeland was able to do this. But it's also a market that is growing on its own. What, in your opinion, are the main driving forces for this kind of growth?


SMB: Increased demand, more enforcement, and more adoption are some of the obvious drivers.


I think the biggest driver is the growing demand for safer working conditions in developing economies. That's where we are looking for most of our growth. They are not just industrializing, but the workers and sometimes governments are demanding better protection. OSHA rules are pretty much followed by any US company in China. So that helps. So the worker goes around saying, "Hey my brother works in this other firm and they have got much better stuff to wear." So there is a whole lot of opportunity there for companies like ours.


On the other hand, US demand growth is slower, but it's still there with product innovation and education of end users, and good execution. Here, we have to innovate, offer more value and execute well; I believe we have the right team for that and we are expecting to see growth in the US as well.


SB: In your opinion, what has been the impact of Lakeland's efforts on the protective clothing industry? Do you think your efforts pre- or post- DuPont have helped the industry in any way? Has the industry benefited in any way?


SMB: I pretty much see what I see through the lens of the company. There is no question that over the past two years—after we lost the license—we completely rebuilt Lakeland with a stronger sales force, more effective marketing, and better execution throughout the company. That's how we did it. And we believe that some of the marketing strategies that helped us sell our own branded products versus our former DuPont products succeeded well and were copied by some of our competitors. So we did maybe create a kind of template, but from my standpoint we had success, and people tend to imitate when good things happen. I don't truly know the total impact on DuPont. What is significant to us may not be so much for them because they are so large. But, certainly, it had a major impact on us internally.
