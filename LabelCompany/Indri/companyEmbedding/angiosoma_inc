AngioSoma, Inc. Files 3 New Patent Applications on Liprostin™






October 11, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MONTGOMERY, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AngioSoma, Inc. (OTCQB: SOAN) filed three (3) new patent applications 
      associated with Liprostin™, adding to the Company’s product pipeline and 
      supplementing the intellectual property already conveyed by Chairman 
      Emeritus Dr. David P. “Doc” Summers, PhD, FACA. The new patents include 
      transdermal skin patches and other methods of treating atherosclerosis, 
      commonly called Peripheral Artery Disease (‘PAD’) and Coronary 
      Artery Disease (‘CAD’).
    


      “We are strengthening our flagship product Liprostin™, which is a 
      unique liposomal delivery of prostaglandin e1 (‘PGE1’), a naturally 
      occurring hormone to treat the most pervasive and insidious disease in 
      America, PAD - the atherosclerotic buildup of fatty plaque on blood 
      vessel walls causing eventual blockage of blood flow. PAD is the 
      same disease as CAD that causes death by heart attack in coronary 
      arteries,” explained Ms. Alexanderia K Blankenship, CEO & President 
      of AngioSoma, Inc. “We are very fortunate to have a product that has 
      successfully completed its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) 
      Phase I and II trials, and is ready to enter Phase III trials. We are 
      continuing to develop new ways to treat PAD and CAD, such as with 
      transdermal skin patches and subcutaneous pellets. We have wide ranging 
      intellectual property covering various treatment modalities including 
      atherectomy catheters (plaque scrappers) and drug releasing stents.”

AngioSoma, Inc. Announces a Liprostin™ Focused Joint Venture | Business Wire
























































AngioSoma, Inc. Announces a Liprostin™ Focused Joint Venture






October 05, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MONTGOMERY, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AngioSoma, Inc. (OTCQB:SOAN) announces a joint venture with La Jolla 
      Capital Partners LLC (‘La Jolla’) focused on the funding and 
      management of US Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) Liprostin™ 
      Phase III trials, as well as the licensing of Liprostin™ worldwide 
      thereafter. Liprostin™ is a liposomal encapsulated prostaglandin e1 
      (‘PGE1’) and is AngioSoma, Inc.’s flagship product. La Jolla personnel 
      have extensive experience in the FDA regulatory environment, both in 
      funding and management of the process, and have a successful product 
      licensing history.
    


      “If Liprostin™ treated ten percent (10%) of the 12 million untreated 
      Peripheral Artery Disease patients in the U.S. as reported by The 
      American Heart Association, this could produce a gross income of six 
      hundred million dollars ($600 million) if we assumed the Company yields 
      five hundred dollars ($500) per patient,” said Ms. Alexanderia K 
      Blankenship, CEO & President of AngioSoma, Inc.
    

      Mr. C. Richard Piazza, President of La Jolla Capital Partners LLC, has 
      experience that directly relates to the future success of Liprostin™ 
      Phase III FDA trials, and in conjunction with Bruce Badeau at La Jolla, 
      have a history of funding the process associated with those trials 
      successfully. Mr. Piazza said, “AngioSoma, Inc.’s Liprostin™ is in a 
      rather unique position as it has completed Phase I and Phase II clinical 
      trials. This puts AngioSoma, Inc. in a position that most small 
      companies never reach – at the brink of Phase III FDA trials with a 
      possibly huge licensing opportunity.”
    

      AngioSoma, Inc. made its September 2016 shareholder presentation 
      available at its website (http://angiosoma.com/shareholder-presentation-september-2016).

AngioSoma, Inc. Acquires Patented Nutraceutical for Muscle Mass Development
Nov 17, 2016
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 

      AngioSoma, Inc. (OTCQB: SOAN) announces that its new subsidiary Soma 
      Nutraceuticals, Inc. is the recipient of intellectual property conveyed 
      by its Chairman Emeritus Dr. David Summers, including a nutraceutical 
      product using either natural or synthetic nicotine in a patented method 
      for substantially accelerating the development of muscle mass and 
      strength (U.S. Patent 7,074,812, “Development of Muscle Mass in a 
      Mammal”). The product produced over $10 million in sales through GNC 
      in 2005 and 2006 when the patent was owned by Endovasc, Inc. Dr. Summers 
      also conveyed additional intellectual properties including products for 
      sleep, staying awake & alert, strength & stamina, and a product for 
      enhancing male libido while also aiding erections.
    

      CEO Alexanderia Blankenship said, “We are excited about the potential 
      of these new products, and their ability to quickly produce substantial 
      cash flow. The muscle development product initially sold through 
      GNC, where it was once in the top ten selling products. While the 
      former patent licensee had a dispute, which caused its discontinuance, 
      Dr. Summers and AngioSoma, Inc. had nothing to do with the dispute, and 
      therefore we hope to quickly get the product selling through its 
      previous sales channels, including GNC.”
