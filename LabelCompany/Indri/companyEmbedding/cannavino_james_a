James Cannavino, a Legend at IBM, Says He'll Retire - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→ExecutivesPEOPLE James Cannavino, a Legend at IBM, Says He'll RetireMarch 03, 1995|From Associated Press


NEW YORK — IBM chief strategist James A. Cannavino has announced that he will retire, ending a 32-year career in which he led two high-profile divisions but failed to reach the top of the world's largest computer company."I've had an itch to run a business," Cannavino said. "I just know that one day I'd like to sit at the end of the table and see if I can do it."International Business Machines Corp. did not immediately name a successor for Cannavino, 50, but the company said through a spokesman that his position will be filled eventually. He will work until March 31.He joined the company as an 18-year-old technician at a Chicago field office and rose to lead both the mainframe and personal computer divisions. His tenure in the PC business was marked by a souring of IBM's relationship with Microsoft Corp. and a 1992 restructuring that led to a rebound in sales.Cannavino was a long-shot candidate for chief executive after John Akers resigned in late 1992. He offered to resign when Louis V. Gerstner Jr. was hired instead.But Gerstner appointed him senior vice president for strategy and development and learned the technicalities of IBM's business from him."We have seen evidence of Gerstner relying on Cannavino heavily to keep him out of the woods when it came to technological arguments," said Bob Djurdjevic, analyst at Annex Research in Phoenix."Technology is something I understand and can convert into executive language as well as technical language, so that's been useful," Cannavino said. "There will be others here who can do that for him, lots of others."Besides, Gerstner "absorbs information like the best sponge you've ever seen," Cannavino said.In a statement to employees announcing Cannavino's retirement, Gerstner said, "I appreciate his contributions to IBM and wish him all the best in the future."Cannavino's hiring in 1963 without a college education has become something of an IBM legend. While going to a technical institute, he left a supermarket job and applied at the IBM office because that's where the bus route ended.After working in Chicago for a few years, Cannavino was sent to IBM's mainframe operations in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and rose through management's ranks. In 1988, he was appointed to lead IBM's PC operations.

History of the Marist Library

Greystone
The Marist College Library was originally housed on the top floor of Greystone in 1928. In 1945, reference, periodical and work areas took over the 
second floor as well, and then in 1949, the Library also claimed Greystone's lowest level. The Library remained in Greystone for 35 years.
Donnelly Hall
The burgeoning library moved from Greystone to Donnelly Hall in 1963. In the space now occupied by the Computer Center and DN256, Donnelly Hall 
housed what was known as the Spellman Library for the next 12 years.
Fontaine Hall
The Library moved from Donnelly to Fontaine Hall in 1975. It remained there until 1998, when the library moved temporarily across Route 9 to the 
former Poughkeepsie Steel Plant, purchased by Marist College to house the Library while the new James A. Cannavino Library was constructed.
James A. Cannavino Library
Dedicated on May 6th, 2000, the 83,000 square-foot James A. Cannavino Library is drawing notice throughout the country for its 
classical design and 21st-century technology. The three-story structure overlooks the campus green and Hudson River on the west, and "Heritage Plaza", 
which connects historic 19th-century buildings and the college chapel, on the east.
This landmark facility showcases IBM digital library technology, allowing Marist students and faculty to access material stored on the college's 
powerful IBM z/900 mainframe as well as online sources of information from around the world.
The $25 million library houses book stacks and archives on its ground floor ; research materials, periodicals and an "e-scriptorium" on its main 
floor ; and a Center for Collaborative Learning on its top floor. The Cannavino Library offers more ports-per-student than any other college or 
university library in the United States. At any of the 860 seats - ranging from individual study carrels to soft-cushioned easy chairs overlooking 
the Hudson River - students and faculty can plug in their laptops and connect to sources of information on campus and across the globe. Don't own a 
laptop? IBM ThinkPads® are available for loan at the circulation desk. Collaborative study rooms allow group discussions on projects while quiet 
study 
areas offer scenic vistas to go with tranquil settings in which to read.
Academic support functions ranging from a writing center to language labs and multimedia classrooms are just some of the features that serve as a 
laboratory for learning on the library's top floor. An executive presentation room provides a corporate board of directors' setting, complete with the 
latest presentation technology offerings.
The Cannavino Library's two-story atrium entrance also features a coffee bar and is a popular gathering space for students, faculty and staff.
The Library is named for James A. Cannavino, a long-time member of the Marist Board of Trustees and one of the country's leading technology 
visionaries.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
