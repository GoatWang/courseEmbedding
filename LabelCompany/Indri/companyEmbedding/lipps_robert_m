My Hero, Dr.Lipp
Founder, Pontine Paus
Dr.Lipp is my hero, my long love, imaginary companion, saviour and the instigator of much laughter… A 100% Natural (i.e. filtered, not processed), a single ingredient product, with no additives that speeds up the skin’s natural ability to heal itself (amazing!!!), which has been tried, tested and loved by mankind for over 1900 years.
FREE from parabens, fragrances, sulfates, mineral oil, petrolatum, colouring agents, T.E .A, D.E.A and silicones etc.  We add no additives, do not test on animals, and only use unpainted fleece from free roaming sheep in Australia. A 100% Natural product and a WHOLE cosmetic product. Tasteless, odourless & so utterly kissable…
