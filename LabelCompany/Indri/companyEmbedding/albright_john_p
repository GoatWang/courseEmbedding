Title: President and Chief Executive Officer
               Company: Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co.
Job Details
               Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. ("Consolidated") has a rich history dating back to 1902 in Jacksonville. It began as Consolidated Naval Stores Company, a timber-based company, specializing in harvesting gum converted into turpentine pitch and rosin from long leaf yellow pine for the maintenance of wooden ships. It became the largest naval stores factor in the world and initially owned more than two million acres of Florida forest lands. Consolidated pioneered in pine timber conservation by improving turpentine extraction methods. The year 1923 was one of the most significant years for Consolidated. Baker, Fentress & Company of Chicago, a closed-end investment company, purchased the Naval Stores Company. Baker Fentress became a guiding force in Consolidated's businesses and helped launch the company as a publicly traded company in 1969 when it began trading on the NASDAQ market. In 1999, Baker Fentress divested its interest in Consolidated and distributed 5,000,000 shares of Consolidated stock to its own shareholders, increasing Consolidated's base of shareholders tenfold. Over the years, Consolidated expanded into Florida cattle ranching and citrus production in Highlands County, and land development, including home building and a Four-Star resort and golf course in Daytona Beach. In the early decades of the century, Consolidated was reputedly the largest land owner in Florida. Consolidated sold much of its land in later years, but retained oil, gas, and mineral rights to 490,000 "surface acres" in twenty Florida counties. One of the company's major achievements was the relocation of the Ladies Professional Golf Association ("LPGA") national headquarters to company lands in Daytona Beach in 1989. The LPGA project includes development of a mixed-use community on approximately 4,000 acres of company land. There are two top-quality golf courses, the LPGA International Champions Golf Course designed by Rees Jones and the LPGA International Legends Golf Course designed by Arthur Hills, as well as a 17,000 square-foot signature clubhouse featuring a pro shop, a restaurant, locker rooms, conference room and banquet facility for groups up to 200. Today, the company is a Florida-based publicly traded real estate company, which owns over 10,000 acres in the Daytona Beach area and a portfolio of income properties in diversified markets in the United States. Consolidated maintains its corporate office in Daytona Beach, and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE MKT) under the symbol CTO.
