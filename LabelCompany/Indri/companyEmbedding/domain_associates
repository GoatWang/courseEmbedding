Building an ecommerce store can be seem intimidating, but if you’re thinking about selling a product or service all you’ll need to do is add your product or service to your store, verify your payment method, and decide how you want to ship your products. Once you’ve done this you’ll be ready to sell your products or services. You will be able to add or remove things you’ve added whenever you want to, and republish your site.  
If you change your mind about the design that you’ve selected, you can edit it whenever you’d like.

How do I sell products or services in my store?                    

You only need to add one product or service before publishing your site for the first time, and generally it’s better to get your site online as soon as possible. If you’re having a tough time getting started, or you need the extra push to get your goods online, you won’t have to worry about complicated website tech--GoCentral Online Store is easy to use. After you’ve published once you can update your payment and shipping methods. The default setting will be PayPal for your payment methods--how your customers pay for your products or services, and the default shipping method will be free shipping, which you’ll want to change if you are selling anything other than services, and need your customers to compensate you for shipping costs. We’ve also added Apple Pay, so customers with Apple Pay enabled devices will be able to benefit from a quick click-through checkout process.                      



How do I ship products to my customers, and what are my options for shipping methods?                    

You have several options. With GoCentral Online Store you can ship via United States Postal Service (USPS), and United Parcel Service (UPS); both which ship domestic and international and are the most accurate shipping methods based on location. You can also ship using a flat rate per order, which is sometimes easier for everyone, or pick weight-based shipping--which charges different amounts based on how much an order weighs. The option is up to you on how you want to ship your products, but we’ve provided several options to make your ecommerce website what you want it to be.                     



Can GoDaddy help make my site secure?                    

We’ve got you covered. You’re going to spend some time and hard work creating your ecommerce website and we want to help your website remain safe and secure. It’s important to note that no website is too small to get hacked, and if you’re creating an online store you want to keep not only your website secure, but also provide security for your customers as they make purchases in your store. Your GoCentral Online Store product is going to come already protected with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), so it won’t be an additional cost on you or your business to keep your website safe.                      



Can I connect my social media accounts to my online store?                    

You absolutely can, and you should! You’ll want to build a strong online presence so you can reach your customers wherever they are, and get them to go to your online store. You can link to your Facebook page, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube channel and Google+ account. Connecting all of your social media tools gives your customers a cohesive experience. They can follow you however they like, comment on your store and products, and easily find out where they can purchase your awesome products. So make sure you’re linking your new ecommerce website to your social media pages as well!

How do I ship products to my customers, and what are my options for shipping methods?            

You have several options. With GoCentral Online Store you can ship via United States Postal Service (USPS), and United Parcel Service (UPS); both which ship domestic and international and are the most accurate shipping methods based on location. You can also ship using a flat rate per order, which is sometimes easier for everyone, or pick weight-based shipping--which charges different amounts based on how much an order weighs. The option is up to you on how you want to ship your products, but we’ve provided several options to make your ecommerce website what you want it to be.             

Can GoDaddy help make my site secure?            

We’ve got you covered. You’re going to spend some time and hard work creating your ecommerce website and we want to help your website remain safe and secure. It’s important to note that no website is too small to get hacked, and if you’re creating an online store you want to keep not only your website secure, but also provide security for your customers as they make purchases in your store. Your GoCentral Online Store product is going to come already protected with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), so it won’t be an additional cost on you or your business to keep your website safe.              

Can I connect my social media accounts to my online store?            

You absolutely can, and you should! You’ll want to build a strong online presence so you can reach your customers wherever they are, and get them to go to your online store. You can link to your Facebook page, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube channel and Google+ account. Connecting all of your social media tools gives your customers a cohesive experience. They can follow you however they like, comment on your store and products, and easily find out where they can purchase your awesome products. So make sure you’re linking your new ecommerce website to your social media pages as well!

Your questions, our answers        



Why should I have a website?                    

By creating a website, you are creating an online presence. This allows you to connect with people that you might not otherwise be able to reach. Whether you’re making a basic website with contact information for your medical practice, creating a landing page for your freelance work, a multi-page experience for your wedding photography business or you just want a place to blog about your thoughts on food – having a website will give you a dynamic advantage.  
With GoCentral Website Builder you can have a site and an online store; you don’t have to choose between the two. You get to build your website based on type of site you want to create. There are over 16,000 theme templates that can be custom-fit to the type of website you want to have, and you can change its look at any time – without losing any of your site’s content. Most themes include professional and royalty-free images and text, so if you need to get your website published quickly, you can. You don’t need to know how to code – this could even be your first time working with a domain – but setting up your new site requires only a few steps. GoCentral Website Builder is designed to generate style choices that you can quickly review and chose without diving into your site’s settings. This will give your visitor an enjoyable experience that feels natural from either a desktop or mobile device.  




What is GoCentral?                    

GoCentral is a website product that lets you create a website that fits your personal or business needs, regardless of your skill set. You no longer have to choose between a website or an online store – now you can have both.  Whether you want an online store, a pop-up site or a professional website to attract new customers, you get to choose how simple or dynamic you want your site to be.  Just pick a design and go create your website with GoCentral.                    



Can I connect my social media and website?                    

GoCentral Website Builder can act as your hub, the place where your friends and contacts can see your posts, photos, videos and more. With the option to link to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube and Google+ on your website, your visitors can be everywhere you are on the web. Being able to cover multiple platforms gives you the opportunity to reach more people, while creating appropriate content for each of your socials (like posting all of your photos on Instagram, and tweeting about your most recent business venture on Twitter). By centrally locating all the links in one place – your new website – you are giving your website visitors a seamless experience. Linking to your social media in your website gives you an advantage in communicating with your visitors; the more they can connect with you and do so in the forum that’s most comfortable to them, the more they’ll engage with your site, and thus you or your business.                     



Can I customize my website?                    

Absolutely. You have the option to customize your website based on your business needs. You can add site content wherever you’d like in a variety of sections; from multiple site pages, to scrollable sections that you can add to each of those pages, to a gallery of images, menus and price lists, and YouTube or Vimeo videos. Each section in your website is customizable as well, from the name of the page, to your website’s navigation bar. You’ll also have the ability to change text colors, styles and font. It’s important to have a mobile and desktop-friendly website. With Website Builder you’ll be able to choose tablet and desktop layouts to give your visitors the experience you want them to have.                      



How can I use my website?                    

In all GoCentral Website Builder plans except for the Personal Plan, any data transmitted from your site will be encrypted using a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. Your SSL will establish an encrypted link between your web server and the browser of the person visiting your site. This means that all data will be kept private; which is important if you want visitors to your site to be safe. If you want to sell products or services in your store, you will want to have a SSL since it protects credit card and bank numbers from being intercepted by hackers.                    



How about a shopping cart?                    

You can sell products and services on your website if you have the Online Store plan. You’ll have an online store that will allow you to add products and services, set up different types of payment methods, and even specific types of shipping. Your store will be integrated into your website as a page. You can add featured products for your visitors to scroll through, make quick purchases using PayPal and Apple Pay and promote your store/products through coupons. You can also use the same type of email marketing that is included in the Business Plus plan to send email communications to your subscribers and customers about sales in your store, coupon offers and events. Establishing a strong online commerce can boost your current sales, especially if you have a brick-and-mortar store.

Frequently asked questions        



What are the benefits of having domain-based email addresses?                    

A domain-based email address, like info@your-business-name.com, helps you look more professional with customers and promotes your website and company. In fact, customers are 9 times more likely to choose a company with a professional email address.+ Every time you send an email from a domain-based address, you're putting your domain name in front of customers and encouraging them to visit your website. 
And with each plan, you can create free ‘alias’ addresses – like one using your first name (keith@your-business-name.com) and others for different departments (sales@your-business-name.com) -- that all feed into a single inbox and make you look even more professional.




What if I already have a Workspace email account from GoDaddy?                    

If you would like to switch your Workspace email to Office 365, please call us at (480) 505-8877 and we can help you make the right decision regarding your existing email plan.                    



I’m part of a larger organization — can I use Microsoft Office 365 from GoDaddy?                    

Our plans are designed for businesses that require fewer than 300 accounts. You may purchase up to 300 accounts of each plan (up to 900 accounts total.) If you have questions, just give us a call at (480) 505-8877. Our award-winning team is here to help 24/7.                    



Why should I buy Office 365 from GoDaddy if I already have Office on my desktop?                    

Our Business Premium plan gives you Office 2016, featuring the latest versions of the desktop applications you know and love—Excel, Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote, and Publisher—plus, free automatic upgrades so you’ll always have the latest version. And unlike the Office you currently have, our Business Premium and Online Essentials plans make it easy to securely share and collaborate on documents using OneDrive for Business and Office Online. They also include real-time online meetings and screen sharing using Skype for Business for PC and Lync for Mac.                    



Which desktop applications come with the Business Premium plan?                    

This depends on whether you are using a PC or a Mac. PC users can download Microsoft Office 2016 versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, Access, OneNote, Publisher and the desktop version of Skype for Business (formerly Lync.) Mac users will be able to download Microsoft Office 2016 versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook as part of the Business Premium plan                    



Will the latest version of Microsoft Office work on my computer?                    

To use the 5 desktop downloads you get with the Business Premium package, you must be on one of the following operating systems:  

PC: Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 10 Server, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2  

Mac: Mac OS X 10.10  

For the best experience, use the latest version of any operating system.

If you are running a different operating system, remember that you can still use Office Online, browser-based versions of your favorite Microsoft tools like Excel, Word or PowerPoint, which are included with the Online Essentials or Business Premium plans.




What is Office Online?                    

Office Online features versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote that are designed to use within a Web browser. You can access Office Online from your cloud storage to create new files, edit existing files, share and collaborate online with clients or colleagues.                    



What is online document collaboration?                    

With our Online Essentials and Business Premium plans, documents created or stored in your OneDrive for Business cloud storage can be simultaneously edited with others inside or outside your company – anyone with a link to a document can make edits at the same time as you. You can even see each other’s edits as you go, so you’ll always be on the same page, all without having to send documents back and forth via email.                    



If I purchase the Business Premium plan, can I download the 5 installs of Office on my employees’ computers?                    

The desktop Office licenses that come with the Business Premium plan are associated with an individual user’s account, including that individual’s sign in and password information.  Downloading a copy onto an employee’s computer would gives them access to your documents.  

We highly recommend that anyone in your organization needing the latest desktop version of Office have their own Business Premium account.




Will the Excel, PowerPoint and Word programs I already have installed on my computer work with my cloud storage and Office Online?                    

OneDrive for Business cloud storage and Office Online work best with the latest version of Microsoft Office, Office 2013, Office 2010, and Office 2011 and 2016 for Mac.  

With these versions of Office, you can select files stored in the cloud and edit them using your desktop applications instead of Office Online. Simply open the file you wish to edit, click ‘Edit in Word/Excel/PowerPoint’ and when you click ‘Save’ within those applications, your document will sync back to your storage.




What is Skype for Business?                    

Skype for Business for PC users, included in the Online Essentials and Business Premium plans, brings together the familiar experience of Skype with the enterprise security, compliance and control that business’ need to run their organizations. Communicate with your colleagues, customers and partners via online conference call or HD video conference.                    



What is Lync Online?                    

Lync Online for Mac users, included in the Online Essentials and Business Premium plans, allows you to communicate with your colleagues, customers and partners via online conference call or HD video conference. With just a couple of clicks, you can share your screen or invite up to 250 people inside or outside your company to take part in an online conversation.                    



What is the cloud?                    

Working or storing files in ‘the cloud' means that your files are stored securely on the Internet — not on your hard drive – so you can access them anytime, anywhere, from almost any device connected to the Web.  

You don't need to buy additional software and you’re not dependent on your computer to get work done. Plus, since your documents are stored on secure servers, you have peace of mind knowing that, even if your hard drive crashes or you spill coffee on your computer, your documents and programs are safe and accessible from any web browser.




What is Office for iPad?                    

Office for iPad includes the full-featured, touch-friendly versions of the most popular Office apps: Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

Office for iPad is available with the Business and Business Premium plan, which includes a license that’s valid for up to 5 iPads or Windows tablets, as well as up to 5 PCs or Macs, for a single user.

            Fast, secure, and reliable Internet infrastructure with Google
          


              Every time you visit a website, your computer performs what's called a "DNS lookup".
              When you manage a domain with us, you get to use the same DNS servers as Google. This
              means your domain name will connect quickly and reliably to your website. We include
              10 million resolutions per year for each domain you register with Google Domains.
              Learn more in the Help Center.

Domain purchase and registration
Google Domains offers domains at a price per year of registration determined by the domain ending or top-level domain (TLD), like ".com", ".org", or ".company". See the table of supported TLDs and prices for the list of prices.
Renewing your domain
You can renew your domain manually before it expires, or automatically each year. If you set up automatic renewal, you will receive a notification email before each renewal with the opportunity to cancel.
You can buy up to ten years of registration in advance (five years for some domains, like .co and .io. See the list below for exceptions). For example, if you buy .com domain for $12 you can buy two years of registration for $24 or ten years for $120. You can auto-renew your domain every year for the same $12.
Note:

If you purchase a domain at a one-time promotional price or with a coupon, the renewal price will still be the regular market price for the domain (for example, $12 for a .com).
If your domain registration has been expired for longer than the grace period (30 days for most domains), there is usually an extra fee for restoring the expired domain.

See  Domain renewal and restoration for more information on renewing and restoring your domain.
Features included at no additional cost

Whois privacy
Domain forwarding and subdomain forwarding
Email forwarding (forwarding of email aliases @<your domain>)
Google nameservers with 10 million DNS resolutions per year
Support via help center, email, chat, or phone.

See Google Domains features for a list of features with descriptions.
Website building and web host partners
Google Domains offers you a choice of 3rd-party website building and web hosting companies. Each partner has their own list of plans and pricing. They are available on the Website tab  for your domain. See Web presence for more information on choosing a website builder.
G Suite integration
You can create user accounts for your domain and provide them with email, Google Drive, Google Sites, and many more features. See the G Suite website for information on pricing. See Integrate with G Suite for instructions on integrating your domain with G Suite.
Premium domains
Premium domains are domains offered for sale or resale at a premium price. There are two kinds of premium domains:

Aftermarket premium domains - These are domains offered for resale by owners for a premium price. Once you have purchased it, you can add multiple years of registration and renew at the regular price for the TLD of the domain (for example, $12 per year for a .com).
Registry premium domains - These are domains the registry is offering for a premium price. In most cases transfer, additional years of registration, renewal, and restoration are charged at a different price from the base price for the TLD—usually the same as the initial premium price.

            Find a domain, create a site, and get custom email
          

   

I'd like to transfer,
              instead.












                Pick a name
              

                Your domain name says a lot about you, and new domain name endings like .guru and
                .photography can help you stand out on the web.

              Pricing 










                Create a site
              

                You don't need to know how to code to build a great website. Opt in for easy site
                creation from services like Blogger, Shopify, Squarespace, Weebly & Wix.
              

    









                Get custom email
              

                Custom email @yourdomain is an optional service by Google and includes helpful
                business tools like video meetings, shared calendars, and online storage.

        Here's what you get with every domain
      



            Private registration at no additional cost
          


              When you purchase or transfer a domain name, private registration is almost always an
              option (some domain name endings do not support this feature). If private
              registration is selected, we cover the cost of keeping your details private (e.g.
              your name, address, and other contact information). Learn more
              in the Help Center.





            Easy integration with top website builders
          


              When you purchase or transfer a domain to Google Domains, you can immediately start
              creating your website with one of our website building providers. Plans vary in cost,
              and options include secure and reliable hosting, customizable templates, and powerful
              features like drag & drop creation and mobile site-management. To
              learn more, visit the Help Center.





            Custom email with G Suite
          


              Look professional with branded email like you@yourcompany. Google G Suite is an
              optional service that lets you easily create email addresses for you and your team
              and includes helpful business tools like shared calendars, video meetings, and online
              storage. Learn more in the Help Center.





            New domain name endings
          


              Over the next few years, hundreds of new domain name endings like .guru and
              .photography will become available. We will be working to provide you with as many
              options as possible so you can find the most relevant and meaningful names as you get
              started online. View all the available domain name endings in the Help Center.





            Customizable sub-domains
          


              Customize your domain with up to 100 sub-domains, such as blog.example.com and
              shop.example.com. This will allow you to create unique pages within your website.

Integral domain - Wikipedia





















 






Integral domain

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if a ≠ 0, an equality ab = ac implies b = c.
"Integral domain" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation. This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity.[3][4] Noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted.[5] This article, however, follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term "integral domain" for the commutative case and using "domain" for the general case including noncommutative rings.
Some sources, notably Lang, use the term entire ring for integral domain.[6]
Some specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions:

commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields

Definitions[edit]
There are a number of equivalent definitions of integral domain:

An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors.
An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring for which every non-zero element is cancellable under multiplication.
An integral domain is a ring for which the set of nonzero elements is a commutative monoid under multiplication (because the monoid is closed under multiplication).
An integral domain is a ring that is (isomorphic to) a subring of a field. (This implies it is a nonzero commutative ring.)
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.

Examples[edit]

The archetypical example is the ring 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 of all integers.
Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 of all real numbers is an integral domain. Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:









Z


⊃

2

Z


⊃

⋯

⊃


2

n



Z


⊃


2

n
+
1



Z


⊃

⋯


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots \;\supset \;2^{n}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2^{n+1}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots }






Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring 




Z

[
x
]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]}

 of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring 




C

[

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.
The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring 




C

[
x
,
y
]

/

(

y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)
)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]/(y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2))}

corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing 




y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)


{\displaystyle y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2)}

is an irreducible polynomial.
The ring

x

)
≅

Z

[


n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)\cong \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {n}}]}

 is an integral domain for any non-square integer 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. If 



n
>
0


{\displaystyle n>0}

 then this ring is always a subring of 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

, otherwise, it is a subring of 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

.
The ring of p-adic integers 





Z


p




{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}}

 is an integral domain.
If 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 is a connected open subset of the complex plane 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

, then the ring 





H


(
U
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(U)}

 consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.
A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.[7][8]

Non-examples[edit]
The following rings are not integral domains.

The zero ring (the ring in which 



0
=
1


{\displaystyle 0=1}

).
The quotient ring Z/mZ when m is a composite number. Indeed, choose a proper factorization 



m
=
x
y


{\displaystyle m=xy}

 (meaning that 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 are not equal to 



1


{\displaystyle 1}

 or 



m


{\displaystyle m}

). Then 



x

{\displaystyle x\not \equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

 and

{\displaystyle y\not \equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

, but 



x
y
≡
0


(
mod

m
)



{\displaystyle xy\equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

.
If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring 



R

S


{\displaystyle R\times S}

 is never an integral domain, because 



(

)
⋅
(

(
0

)


{\displaystyle (1,0)\cdot (0,1)=(0,0)}

 is the zero element.
When 



n


{\displaystyle n}

Z

[

/

(

x

n
)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)}

The ring of n × n matrices over any nonzero ring when n ≥ 2. If 



M


{\displaystyle M}

N


{\displaystyle N}

N

Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements[edit]
See also: Divisibility (ring theory)
In this section, R is an integral domain.
Given elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.
The elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.
If a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.[9] Equivalently, a and b are associates if a=ub for some unit u.
If q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.
If p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.
Every prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since 




a

2


+
5

b

2


=
3


{\displaystyle a^{2}+5b^{2}=3}

 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides 




(
2
+


−
5


)


(
2
−


−
5


)



{\displaystyle \left(2+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(2-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)}

 without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.
While unique factorization does not hold in 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

, there is unique factorization of ideals. See Lasker–Noether theorem.
Properties[edit]

A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.
If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.
Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.
The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab = ac then b = c. Another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.
The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI = xJ, then either x is zero or I = J.
An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.
An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.

Field of fractions[edit]
Main article: Field of fractions
The field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations. It is "the smallest field containing R" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism R → K such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers Z is the field of rational numbers Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.
Algebraic geometry[edit]
Integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 = 0 implies x = 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.
This translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.
More generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.
Characteristic and homomorphisms[edit]
The characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.
If R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = x p is injective.

Integral domain - Wikipedia





















 






Integral domain

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if a ≠ 0, an equality ab = ac implies b = c.
"Integral domain" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation. This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity.[3][4] Noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted.[5] This article, however, follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term "integral domain" for the commutative case and using "domain" for the general case including noncommutative rings.
Some sources, notably Lang, use the term entire ring for integral domain.[6]
Some specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions:

commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields

Definitions[edit]
There are a number of equivalent definitions of integral domain:

An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors.
An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring for which every non-zero element is cancellable under multiplication.
An integral domain is a ring for which the set of nonzero elements is a commutative monoid under multiplication (because the monoid is closed under multiplication).
An integral domain is a ring that is (isomorphic to) a subring of a field. (This implies it is a nonzero commutative ring.)
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.

Examples[edit]

The archetypical example is the ring 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 of all integers.
Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 of all real numbers is an integral domain. Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:









Z


⊃

2

Z


⊃

⋯

⊃


2

n



Z


⊃


2

n
+
1



Z


⊃

⋯


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots \;\supset \;2^{n}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2^{n+1}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots }






Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring 




Z

[
x
]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]}

 of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring 




C

[

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.
The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring 




C

[
x
,
y
]

/

(

y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)
)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]/(y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2))}

corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing 




y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)


{\displaystyle y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2)}

is an irreducible polynomial.
The ring 




Z

[
x
]

/

(

x

2


−
n
)
≅

Z

[


n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)\cong \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {n}}]}

 is an integral domain for any non-square integer 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. If 



n
>
0


{\displaystyle n>0}

 then this ring is always a subring of 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

, otherwise, it is a subring of 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

.
The ring of p-adic integers 





Z


p




{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}}

 is an integral domain.
If 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 is a connected open subset of the complex plane 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

, then the ring 





H


(
U
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(U)}

 consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.
A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.[7][8]

Non-examples[edit]
The following rings are not integral domains.

The zero ring (the ring in which 



0
=
1


{\displaystyle 0=1}

).
The quotient ring Z/mZ when m is a composite number. Indeed, choose a proper factorization 



m
=
x
y


{\displaystyle m=xy}

 (meaning that 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 are not equal to 



1


{\displaystyle 1}

 or 



m


{\displaystyle m}

). Then 



x

0


(

{\displaystyle x\not \equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

 and 



y

{\displaystyle y\not \equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

, but 



x
y
≡
0


(
mod

m
)



{\displaystyle xy\equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

.
If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring 



R

S


{\displaystyle R\times S}

 is never an integral domain, because 



(

)
⋅
(

(

{\displaystyle (1,0)\cdot (0,1)=(0,0)}

Z

(

)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)}

The ring of n × n matrices over any nonzero ring when n ≥ 2. If 



M

{\displaystyle M=N=({\begin{smallmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{smallmatrix}})}

{\displaystyle k[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]/(fg)}

Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements[edit]
See also: Divisibility (ring theory)
In this section, R is an integral domain.
Given elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.
The elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.
If a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.[9] Equivalently, a and b are associates if a=ub for some unit u.
If q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.
If p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.
Every prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since 




a

2


+
5

b

2


=
3


{\displaystyle a^{2}+5b^{2}=3}

 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides 




(
2
+


−
5


)


(
2
−


−
5


)



{\displaystyle \left(2+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(2-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)}

 without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.
While unique factorization does not hold in 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

, there is unique factorization of ideals. See Lasker–Noether theorem.
Properties[edit]

A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.
If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.
Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.
The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab = ac then b = c. Another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.
The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI = xJ, then either x is zero or I = J.
An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.
An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.

Field of fractions[edit]
Main article: Field of fractions
The field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations. It is "the smallest field containing R" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism R → K such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers Z is the field of rational numbers Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.
Algebraic geometry[edit]
Integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 = 0 implies x = 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.
This translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.
More generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.
Characteristic and homomorphisms[edit]
The characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.
If R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = x p is injective.

An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.

Examples[edit]

The archetypical example is the ring 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 of all integers.
Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 of all real numbers is an integral domain. Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:









Z


⊃

2

Z


⊃

⋯

⊃

n



Z

⋯


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots \;\supset \;2^{n}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2^{n+1}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots }






Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring 




Z

[
x
]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]}

 of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring 




C

[

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.
The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring 




C

[
x
,
y
]

/

(

y

)
(
x

{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]/(y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2))}

corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing 




y

2


−
x
(
x
−

)
(
x

{\displaystyle y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2)}

is an irreducible polynomial.

[

{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)\cong \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {n}}]}

n


{\displaystyle n}

. If 



n

C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

.
The ring of p-adic integers 





Z


p




{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}}

 is an integral domain.
If 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 is a connected open subset of the complex plane 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

, then the ring 





H


(
U
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(U)}

 consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.
A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.[7][8]

If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring

Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements[edit]
See also: Divisibility (ring theory)
In this section, R is an integral domain.
Given elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.
The elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.
If a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.[9] Equivalently, a and b are associates if a=ub for some unit u.
If q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.
If p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.
Every prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since 




a

2


+
5

b

2


=
3


{\displaystyle a^{2}+5b^{2}=3}

 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides 




(
2
+


−
5


)


(
2
−


−
5


)



{\displaystyle \left(2+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(2-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)}

 without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.
While unique factorization does not hold in 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

, there is unique factorization of ideals. See Lasker–Noether theorem.
Properties[edit]

A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.
If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.
Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.
The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab = ac then b = c. Another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.
The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI = xJ, then either x is zero or I = J.
An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.
An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.

Field of fractions[edit]
Main article: Field of fractions
The field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations. It is "the smallest field containing R" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism R → K such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers Z is the field of rational numbers Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.
Algebraic geometry[edit]
Integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 = 0 implies x = 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.
This translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.
More generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.
Characteristic and homomorphisms[edit]
The characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.
If R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = x p is injective.

Integral domain

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if a ≠ 0, an equality ab = ac implies b = c.
"Integral domain" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation. This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity.[3][4] Noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted.[5] This article, however, follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term "integral domain" for the commutative case and using "domain" for the general case including noncommutative rings.
Some sources, notably Lang, use the term entire ring for integral domain.[6]
Some specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions:

commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields

Definitions[edit]
There are a number of equivalent definitions of integral domain:

An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors.
An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring for which every non-zero element is cancellable under multiplication.
An integral domain is a ring for which the set of nonzero elements is a commutative monoid under multiplication (because the monoid is closed under multiplication).
An integral domain is a ring that is (isomorphic to) a subring of a field. (This implies it is a nonzero commutative ring.)
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.

Examples[edit]

The archetypical example is the ring 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 of all integers.
Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 of all real numbers is an integral domain. Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:

Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring 




Z

[
x

{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]}

 of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring 




C

x

{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.
The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring

corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing

{\displaystyle y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2)}

n

If 



U


{\displaystyle U}

C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

, then the ring 





H


(
U
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(U)}

 consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.
A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.[7][8]

Non-examples[edit]
The following rings are not integral domains.

The zero ring (the ring in which

If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring

Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements[edit]
See also: Divisibility (ring theory)
In this section, R is an integral domain.
Given elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.
The elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.
If a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.[9] Equivalently, a and b are associates if a=ub for some unit u.
If q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.
If p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.
Every prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since 




a

2


+
5

b

2


=
3


{\displaystyle a^{2}+5b^{2}=3}

 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides 




(
2
+


−
5


)


(
2
−


−
5


)



{\displaystyle \left(2+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(2-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)}

 without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.
While unique factorization does not hold in 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

, there is unique factorization of ideals. See Lasker–Noether theorem.
Properties[edit]

A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.
If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.
Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.
The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab = ac then b = c. Another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.
The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI = xJ, then either x is zero or I = J.
An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.
An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.

Field of fractions[edit]
Main article: Field of fractions
The field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations. It is "the smallest field containing R" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism R → K such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers Z is the field of rational numbers Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.
Algebraic geometry[edit]
Integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 = 0 implies x = 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.
This translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.
More generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.
Characteristic and homomorphisms[edit]
The characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.
If R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = x p is injective.

Integral domain - Wikipedia





















 






Integral domain

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if a ≠ 0, an equality ab = ac implies b = c.
"Integral domain" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation. This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity.[3][4] Noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted.[5] This article, however, follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term "integral domain" for the commutative case and using "domain" for the general case including noncommutative rings.
Some sources, notably Lang, use the term entire ring for integral domain.[6]
Some specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions:

commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields

Definitions[edit]
There are a number of equivalent definitions of integral domain:

An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors.
An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring for which every non-zero element is cancellable under multiplication.
An integral domain is a ring for which the set of nonzero elements is a commutative monoid under multiplication (because the monoid is closed under multiplication).
An integral domain is a ring that is (isomorphic to) a subring of a field. (This implies it is a nonzero commutative ring.)
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.

Examples[edit]

The archetypical example is the ring 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 of all integers.
Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 of all real numbers is an integral domain. Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:









Z


⊃

2

Z


⊃

⋯

⊃


2

n



Z


⊃


2

n
+
1



Z


⊃

⋯


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots \;\supset \;2^{n}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2^{n+1}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots }






Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring 




Z

[
x
]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]}

 of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring 




C

[

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.
The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring 




C

[
x
,
y
]

/

(

y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)
)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]/(y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2))}

corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing 




y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)


{\displaystyle y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2)}

is an irreducible polynomial.
The ring 




Z

x

x

−
n
)
≅

Z

[


n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)\cong \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {n}}]}

 is an integral domain for any non-square integer 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. If 



n
>
0


{\displaystyle n>0}

 then this ring is always a subring of 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

, otherwise, it is a subring of 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

.
The ring of p-adic integers 





Z


p




{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}}

 is an integral domain.
If 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 is a connected open subset of the complex plane 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

, then the ring 





H


(
U
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(U)}

 consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.
A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.[7][8]

Non-examples[edit]
The following rings are not integral domains.

The zero ring (the ring in which 



0
=
1


{\displaystyle 0=1}

).
The quotient ring Z/mZ when m is a composite number. Indeed, choose a proper factorization 



m
=
x
y


{\displaystyle m=xy}

 (meaning that 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 are not equal to 



1


{\displaystyle 1}

 or 



m


{\displaystyle m}

). Then 



x

0


(

m

{\displaystyle x\not \equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

 and 



y

{\displaystyle y\not \equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

, but 



x
y
≡
0


(
mod

m
)



{\displaystyle xy\equiv 0{\pmod {m}}}

.
If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring 



R
×
S


{\displaystyle R\times S}

 is never an integral domain, because 



(
1

0
)
⋅
(

(
0

{\displaystyle (1,0)\cdot (0,1)=(0,0)}

{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)}

Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements[edit]
See also: Divisibility (ring theory)
In this section, R is an integral domain.
Given elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.
The elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.
If a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.[9] Equivalently, a and b are associates if a=ub for some unit u.
If q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.
If p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.
Every prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since 




a

2


+
5

b

2


=
3


{\displaystyle a^{2}+5b^{2}=3}

 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides

−
5


)


(
2
−


−
5


)



{\displaystyle \left(2+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(2-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)}

 without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.
While unique factorization does not hold in 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

, there is unique factorization of ideals. See Lasker–Noether theorem.
Properties[edit]

A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.
If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.
Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.
The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab = ac then b = c. Another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.
The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI = xJ, then either x is zero or I = J.
An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.
An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.

Field of fractions[edit]
Main article: Field of fractions
The field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations. It is "the smallest field containing R" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism R → K such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers Z is the field of rational numbers Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.
Algebraic geometry[edit]
Integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 = 0 implies x = 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.
This translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.
More generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.
Characteristic and homomorphisms[edit]
The characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.
If R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = x p is injective.

Integral domain - Wikipedia





















 






Integral domain

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if a ≠ 0, an equality ab = ac implies b = c.
"Integral domain" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation. This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity.[3][4] Noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted.[5] This article, however, follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term "integral domain" for the commutative case and using "domain" for the general case including noncommutative rings.
Some sources, notably Lang, use the term entire ring for integral domain.[6]
Some specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions:

commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields

Definitions[edit]
There are a number of equivalent definitions of integral domain:

An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors.
An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal.
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring for which every non-zero element is cancellable under multiplication.
An integral domain is a ring for which the set of nonzero elements is a commutative monoid under multiplication (because the monoid is closed under multiplication).
An integral domain is a ring that is (isomorphic to) a subring of a field. (This implies it is a nonzero commutative ring.)
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.

Examples[edit]

The archetypical example is the ring 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 of all integers.
Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 of all real numbers is an integral domain. Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:









Z


⊃

2

Z


⊃

⋯

⊃

n



Z

n
+
1



Z

⋯


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots \;\supset \;2^{n}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;2^{n+1}\mathbb {Z} \;\supset \;\cdots }






Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring 




Z

[
x
]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]}

 of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring 




C

[

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.
The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring 




C

[
x
,
y
]

/

(

y

−
x
(
x

)
(
x
−

)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]/(y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2))}

corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing 




y

2


−
x
(
x
−
1
)
(
x
−
2
)


{\displaystyle y^{2}-x(x-1)(x-2)}

is an irreducible polynomial.
The ring

Z

[


n


]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [x]/(x^{2}-n)\cong \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {n}}]}

 is an integral domain for any non-square integer 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. If 



n
>
0


{\displaystyle n>0}

 then this ring is always a subring of 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

, otherwise, it is a subring of 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

.
The ring of p-adic integers 





Z


p




{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}}

 is an integral domain.
If 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 is a connected open subset of the complex plane 




C



{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }

, then the ring 





H


(
U
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(U)}

 consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.
A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.[7][8]

Non-examples[edit]
The following rings are not integral domains.

The zero ring (the ring in which 



0

1


{\displaystyle 0=1}

).
The quotient ring Z/mZ when m is a composite number. Indeed, choose a proper factorization 



m

x


{\displaystyle x}

, but

.
If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring

Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements[edit]
See also: Divisibility (ring theory)
In this section, R is an integral domain.
Given elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.
The elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.
If a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.[9] Equivalently, a and b are associates if a=ub for some unit u.
If q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.
If p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.
Every prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since 




a

2


+
5

b

3


{\displaystyle a^{2}+5b^{2}=3}

 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides

−
5


)


(
2
−


−
5


)



{\displaystyle \left(2+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(2-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)}

 without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.
While unique factorization does not hold in 




Z


[


−
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

, there is unique factorization of ideals. See Lasker–Noether theorem.
Properties[edit]

A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.
If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.
Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.
The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab = ac then b = c. Another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.
The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI = xJ, then either x is zero or I = J.
An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.
An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.

Field of fractions[edit]
Main article: Field of fractions
The field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations. It is "the smallest field containing R" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism R → K such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers Z is the field of rational numbers Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.
Algebraic geometry[edit]
Integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 = 0 implies x = 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.
This translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.
More generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.
Characteristic and homomorphisms[edit]
The characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.
If R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = x p is injective.

Your questions, our answers        



Why should I have a website?                    

By creating a website, you are creating an online presence. This allows you to connect with people that you might not otherwise be able to reach. Whether you’re making a basic website with contact information for your medical practice, creating a landing page for your freelance work, a multi-page experience for your wedding photography business or you just want a place to blog about your thoughts on food – having a website will give you a dynamic advantage.  
With GoCentral Website Builder you can have a site and an online store; you don’t have to choose between the two. You get to build your website based on type of site you want to create. There are over 16,000 theme templates that can be custom-fit to the type of website you want to have, and you can change its look at any time – without losing any of your site’s content. Most themes include professional and royalty-free images and text, so if you need to get your website published quickly, you can. You don’t need to know how to code – this could even be your first time working with a domain – but setting up your new site requires only a few steps. GoCentral Website Builder is designed to generate style choices that you can quickly review and chose without diving into your site’s settings. This will give your visitor an enjoyable experience that feels natural from either a desktop or mobile device.  




What is GoCentral?                    

GoCentral is a website product that lets you create a website that fits your personal or business needs, regardless of your skill set. You no longer have to choose between a website or an online store – now you can have both.  Whether you want an online store, a pop-up site or a professional website to attract new customers, you get to choose how simple or dynamic you want your site to be.  Just pick a design and go create your website with GoCentral.                    



Can I connect my social media and website?                    

GoCentral Website Builder can act as your hub, the place where your friends and contacts can see your posts, photos, videos and more. With the option to link to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube and Google+ on your website, your visitors can be everywhere you are on the web. Being able to cover multiple platforms gives you the opportunity to reach more people, while creating appropriate content for each of your socials (like posting all of your photos on Instagram, and tweeting about your most recent business venture on Twitter). By centrally locating all the links in one place – your new website – you are giving your website visitors a seamless experience. Linking to your social media in your website gives you an advantage in communicating with your visitors; the more they can connect with you and do so in the forum that’s most comfortable to them, the more they’ll engage with your site, and thus you or your business.                     



Can I customize my website?                    

Absolutely. You have the option to customize your website based on your business needs. You can add site content wherever you’d like in a variety of sections; from multiple site pages, to scrollable sections that you can add to each of those pages, to a gallery of images, menus and price lists, and YouTube or Vimeo videos. Each section in your website is customizable as well, from the name of the page, to your website’s navigation bar. You’ll also have the ability to change text colors, styles and font. It’s important to have a mobile and desktop-friendly website. With Website Builder you’ll be able to choose tablet and desktop layouts to give your visitors the experience you want them to have.                      



How can I use my website?                    

In all GoCentral Website Builder plans except for the Personal Plan, any data transmitted from your site will be encrypted using a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. Your SSL will establish an encrypted link between your web server and the browser of the person visiting your site. This means that all data will be kept private; which is important if you want visitors to your site to be safe. If you want to sell products or services in your store, you will want to have a SSL since it protects credit card and bank numbers from being intercepted by hackers.                    



How about a shopping cart?                    

You can sell products and services on your website if you have the Online Store plan.

Why should I have a website?            

By creating a website, you are creating an online presence. This allows you to connect with people that you might not otherwise be able to reach. Whether you’re making a basic website with contact information for your medical practice, creating a landing page for your freelance work, a multi-page experience for your wedding photography business or you just want a place to blog about your thoughts on food – having a website will give you a dynamic advantage.  
With GoCentral Website Builder you can have a site and an online store; you don’t have to choose between the two. You get to build your website based on type of site you want to create. There are over 16,000 theme templates that can be custom-fit to the type of website you want to have, and you can change its look at any time – without losing any of your site’s content. Most themes include professional and royalty-free images and text, so if you need to get your website published quickly, you can. You don’t need to know how to code – this could even be your first time working with a domain – but setting up your new site requires only a few steps. GoCentral Website Builder is designed to generate style choices that you can quickly review and chose without diving into your site’s settings. This will give your visitor an enjoyable experience that feels natural from either a desktop or mobile device.  


What is GoCentral?            

GoCentral is a website product that lets you create a website that fits your personal or business needs, regardless of your skill set. You no longer have to choose between a website or an online store – now you can have both.  Whether you want an online store, a pop-up site or a professional website to attract new customers, you get to choose how simple or dynamic you want your site to be.  Just pick a design and go create your website with GoCentral.            

Can I connect my social media and website?            

GoCentral Website Builder can act as your hub, the place where your friends and contacts can see your posts, photos, videos and more. With the option to link to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube and Google+ on your website, your visitors can be everywhere you are on the web. Being able to cover multiple platforms gives you the opportunity to reach more people, while creating appropriate content for each of your socials (like posting all of your photos on Instagram, and tweeting about your most recent business venture on Twitter). By centrally locating all the links in one place – your new website – you are giving your website visitors a seamless experience. Linking to your social media in your website gives you an advantage in communicating with your visitors; the more they can connect with you and do so in the forum that’s most comfortable to them, the more they’ll engage with your site, and thus you or your business.             

Can I customize my website?            

Absolutely. You have the option to customize your website based on your business needs. You can add site content wherever you’d like in a variety of sections; from multiple site pages, to scrollable sections that you can add to each of those pages, to a gallery of images, menus and price lists, and YouTube or Vimeo videos. Each section in your website is customizable as well, from the name of the page, to your website’s navigation bar. You’ll also have the ability to change text colors, styles and font. It’s important to have a mobile and desktop-friendly website. With Website Builder you’ll be able to choose tablet and desktop layouts to give your visitors the experience you want them to have.              

How can I use my website?            

In all GoCentral Website Builder plans except for the Personal Plan, any data transmitted from your site will be encrypted using a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. Your SSL will establish an encrypted link between your web server and the browser of the person visiting your site. This means that all data will be kept private; which is important if you want visitors to your site to be safe. If you want to sell products or services in your store, you will want to have a SSL since it protects credit card and bank numbers from being intercepted by hackers.

            Fast, secure, and reliable Internet infrastructure with Google
          


              Every time you visit a website, your computer performs what's called a "DNS lookup".
              When you manage a domain with us, you get to use the same DNS servers as Google. This
              means your domain name will connect quickly and reliably to your website. We include
              10 million resolutions per year for each domain you register with Google Domains.
              Learn more in the Help Center.

Domain purchase and registration
Google Domains offers domains at a price per year of registration determined by the domain ending or top-level domain (TLD), like ".com", ".org", or ".company". See the table of supported TLDs and prices for the list of prices.
Renewing your domain
You can renew your domain manually before it expires, or automatically each year. If you set up automatic renewal, you will receive a notification email before each renewal with the opportunity to cancel.
You can buy up to ten years of registration in advance (five years for some domains, like .co and .io. See the list below for exceptions). For example, if you buy .com domain for $12 you can buy two years of registration for $24 or ten years for $120. You can auto-renew your domain every year for the same $12.
Note:

If you purchase a domain at a one-time promotional price or with a coupon, the renewal price will still be the regular market price for the domain (for example, $12 for a .com).
If your domain registration has been expired for longer than the grace period (30 days for most domains), there is usually an extra fee for restoring the expired domain.

See  Domain renewal and restoration for more information on renewing and restoring your domain.
Features included at no additional cost

Domain forwarding and subdomain forwarding
Email forwarding (forwarding of email aliases @<your domain>)

Support via help center, email, chat, or phone.

See Google Domains features for a list of features with descriptions.
Website building and web host partners
Google Domains offers you a choice of 3rd-party website building and web hosting companies. Each partner has their own list of plans and pricing. They are available on the Website tab  for your domain. See Web presence for more information on choosing a website builder.
G Suite integration
You can create user accounts for your domain and provide them with email, Google Drive, Google Sites, and many more features. See the G Suite website for information on pricing. See Integrate with G Suite for instructions on integrating your domain with G Suite.
Premium domains
Premium domains are domains offered for sale or resale at a premium price. There are two kinds of premium domains:

Aftermarket premium domains - These are domains offered for resale by owners for a premium price. Once you have purchased it, you can add multiple years of registration and renew at the regular price for the TLD of the domain (for example, $12 per year for a .com).
Registry premium domains - These are domains the registry is offering for a premium price. In most cases transfer, additional years of registration, renewal, and restoration are charged at a different price from the base price for the TLD—usually the same as the initial premium price.

            Private registration at no additional cost
          


              When you purchase or transfer a domain name, private registration is almost always an
              option (some domain name endings do not support this feature). If private
              registration is selected, we cover the cost of keeping your details private (e.g.
              your name, address, and other contact information). Learn more
              in the Help Center.





            Easy integration with top website builders
          


              When you purchase or transfer a domain to Google Domains, you can immediately start
              creating your website with one of our website building providers. Plans vary in cost,
              and options include secure and reliable hosting, customizable templates, and powerful
              features like drag & drop creation and mobile site-management. To
