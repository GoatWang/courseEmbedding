Why Queenslanders should compare electricity plans
When it comes to finding a great value power plan in Queensland, there are more choices now than ever before.
The retail energy market in South East Queensland (e.g. Brisbane, Ipswich, Gold Coast) is deregulated. This means that the retailers set the price of their products; not the government. If you live in regional Queensland, prices continue to be regulated by the State Government.
Now that there’s increased competition in SEQ, it’s important to review your household’s power plan and see if there’s anything better. Our service outlines discounts, annual savings, and more – no matter what kind of contract you’re currently on. Learn more >

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]

Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010."

The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J.

Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

U.S. stocks open higher on Yellen comments, energy strength
U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday, after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in prepared congressional testimony, said interest rate increases would be gradual and that they wouldn't need to rise much further. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 82 points, or 0.4%, to 21,497. The S&P 500  added 10 points to 2,436, a gain of 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite Index  rose 46 points to 6,240, a rise of 0.8%. Stocks have been supported by low rates over the past several years, and abrupt changes to that environment could lead to volatility in equities. Also boosting stocks was the energy sector, which gained alongside a 2% jump in the price of crude oil. Among the biggest gainers, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  added 1.7% while Exxon Mobil Corp.  was up 0.8%.

Chesapeake Energy's stock sinks after Macquarie turns bearish
Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  sank 5.4% toward an 11-month low in midday trade Wednesday, after Macquarie Research turned bearish on the oil and gas explorer, citing concerns that the company is ill-equipped to deal with another drop in oil prices. Analyst Paul Grigel downgraded the stock to a rare underperform rating from neutral and slashed his stock price target to $3.50, which is 25% below current levels, from $6.00. Only 5.8% of the U.S. companies covered by Macquarie are rated underperform. Grigel said the lower outlook for crude prices pressures Chesapeake's fundamentals given the company's recent efforts to increase its oil exposure over natural gas. "While the company has made strides in repositioning itself, it simply isn't far enough along to sustainably compete in a lower-for-longer crude world," Grigel wrote in a research note. Continuous crude oil futures tumbled 1.6% toward a 10 1/2-month low, and have now plunged more than 21% from the February peak.  And although the company has been selling assets to pay down its high debt load, Grigel said he is still estimates a "material outspend on high leverage with concerns around liquidity." The stock has plummeted 34% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has shed 15% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Energy stocks lead S&P 500 decliners as crude extends recent losses
Energy stocks led S&P 500 decliners on Tuesday, as crude oil prices extended recent losses after OPEC stopped short of more aggressive action to cut production. July West Texas Intermediate crude  declined by 35 cents, or 0.7%, to $49.46 a barrel, as traders returned to their desks after the holiday weekend. Devon Energy  was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Kinder Morgan Inc.  shed 2.6%, Hess Corp.  fell 2.4% and Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was down 2.5%. Cimarex Energy Co.  fell 2.2% and Williams Companies Inc.  was down 1.9%. Pioneer Natural Resources Corp.  fell 1.9% and Marathon Oil Corp.  was down 1.9%. Tesoro Corp.  bucked the trend to gain 0.7%, after the stock was upgraded to overweight from equal weight Tuesday at Morgan Stanley. Analysts pointed to several catalysts for the oil refiner, including its acquisition of Western Refining Inc., which they expect will diversify its growth opportunities. The S&P 500  was flat.

Energy stocks sink as crude oil prices tumble below $50 a barrel
Shares of oil companies were broadly and sharply lower Thursday, after OPEC's decision to extend its production plan, rather than cut it, sent crude oil prices tumbling below $50 a barrel. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  dropped 1.4%, bucking the rally in the broader stock market, with 32 of its 34 equity components trading lower. Among the biggest losers and most-active shares, Transocean Ltd.  sank 6.2%, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  slid 5.3% and Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 5.2%. Among the ETF's most-heavily weighted, shares of Exxon Mobil Corp.  dropped 0.7%, Chevron Corp.  shed 1% and Schlumberger Ltd.  gave up 2.2%. The two XLE gainers were shares of Kinder Morgan Inc. , up 0.3% and Tesoro Corp. , up 2.3%. July crude oil futures  plunged 4.8% to $48.91 a barrel. While the XLE tumbled, the S&P 500 rallied 0.4% toward a record close.

Oil stocks surge after Saudis, Russians endorse extension of production cuts
Energy stocks were broadly and sharply higher Monday, as a big rally in crude oil prices helped light a fire under the sector. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  ran up 1.4% in morning trade, making it by far the biggest gainer among trackers of the S&P 500's 11 key sectors. Crude oil futures shot up 3.3%, after the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia said they endorsed a nine-month extension to production cuts agreed upon by OPEC. Oil and gas explorer Marathon Oil Corp.'s stock  surged 5.2% to pace the S&P 500's  advancers. Among shares of other top S&P 500 gainers, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  ran up 3.6%, Transocean Ltd.  climbed 3.5%, Helmerich & Payne Inc.  rallied 3.3%, Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 3.3% and Hess Corp.  gained 3.1%. The energy ETF closed at a nine-month low of $66.26 as recently as May 4, down 15% from an 18-month high of $77.83 on Dec. 13.

Stock market rebounds as energy stocks on pace for biggest daily jump in months
A popular way to bet on energy stocks on Wednesday was on track to see its best one-day climb in two months, as crude-oil prices jumped following an upbeat U.S. inventory report. The exchange-traded Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was up 1.6% in recent trade, marking its best daily rise since a 2.2% climb March 15, with U.S. crude-oil prices  up 2.8% at $47.15 a barrel in late-morning trade after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday showed that domestic crude supplies dropped by 5.2 million barrels for the week ended May 5. Markets have been dogged by concerns about oversupply in the oil industry, which has weighed on investor sentiment and caused a steady retreat in oil prices. A 6% climb in shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  led the exchange-traded fund's components. The S&P 500's energy sector was the best performer among its 11 sectors. Another popular oil fund, United States Oil Fund LP , was on track for its best daily gain since Jan. 11. Stocks paring early losses, with the S&P 500 index  trading flat at 2,395. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was being buoyed by blue-chip components Chevron Corp.  and Caterpillar Inc. , while the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  was trading near break-even. The trading action comes in the wake of President Donald Trump's late-Tuesday firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, which rattled Washington and has cast some doubt on the president's ability to get market-friendly legislation implemented. Oil's recent climb has helped to mitigate some of that early selling pressure.

Energy stocks rally to lead S&P 500 gainers as oil erases some of Thursday's loss
Energy stocks rallied to lead S&P 500 gainers Friday, rebounding from a rout Thursday driven by a steep decline in oil prices. Crude futures were back in the black Friday after a nearly 5% decline in the prior session, although prices were on track for a hefty loss for the week. Oil has suffered "heavy losses this week as investors are no longer pleased with current output cuts by OPEC," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, as reported by MarketWatch. Futures were up 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $46.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Against that backdrop, Transocean Ltd  led the advancers with a 7.4% gain. Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was up 5.4%, NRG Energy Inc.  was up 3% and Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 2.5%. National Oilwell Varco Inc.  added 2.3%, TechnipFMC Plc  rose 2.2% and Hess Corp.  tacked on 2.1%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 0.8%. The S&P 500  was slightly higher.

U.S. stocks open higher on Yellen comments, energy strength
U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday, after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in prepared congressional testimony, said interest rate increases would be gradual and that they wouldn't need to rise much further. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 82 points, or 0.4%, to 21,497. The S&P 500  added 10 points to 2,436, a gain of 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite Index  rose 46 points to 6,240, a rise of 0.8%. Stocks have been supported by low rates over the past several years, and abrupt changes to that environment could lead to volatility in equities. Also boosting stocks was the energy sector, which gained alongside a 2% jump in the price of crude oil. Among the biggest gainers, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  added 1.7% while Exxon Mobil Corp.  was up 0.8%.

Chesapeake Energy's stock sinks after Macquarie turns bearish
Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  sank 5.4% toward an 11-month low in midday trade Wednesday, after Macquarie Research turned bearish on the oil and gas explorer, citing concerns that the company is ill-equipped to deal with another drop in oil prices. Analyst Paul Grigel downgraded the stock to a rare underperform rating from neutral and slashed his stock price target to $3.50, which is 25% below current levels, from $6.00. Only 5.8% of the U.S. companies covered by Macquarie are rated underperform. Grigel said the lower outlook for crude prices pressures Chesapeake's fundamentals given the company's recent efforts to increase its oil exposure over natural gas. "While the company has made strides in repositioning itself, it simply isn't far enough along to sustainably compete in a lower-for-longer crude world," Grigel wrote in a research note. Continuous crude oil futures tumbled 1.6% toward a 10 1/2-month low, and have now plunged more than 21% from the February peak.  And although the company has been selling assets to pay down its high debt load, Grigel said he is still estimates a "material outspend on high leverage with concerns around liquidity." The stock has plummeted 34% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has shed 15% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Energy stocks lead S&P 500 decliners as crude extends recent losses
Energy stocks led S&P 500 decliners on Tuesday, as crude oil prices extended recent losses after OPEC stopped short of more aggressive action to cut production. July West Texas Intermediate crude  declined by 35 cents, or 0.7%, to $49.46 a barrel, as traders returned to their desks after the holiday weekend. Devon Energy  was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Kinder Morgan Inc.  shed 2.6%, Hess Corp.  fell 2.4% and Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was down 2.5%. Cimarex Energy Co.  fell 2.2% and Williams Companies Inc.  was down 1.9%. Pioneer Natural Resources Corp.  fell 1.9% and Marathon Oil Corp.  was down 1.9%. Tesoro Corp.  bucked the trend to gain 0.7%, after the stock was upgraded to overweight from equal weight Tuesday at Morgan Stanley. Analysts pointed to several catalysts for the oil refiner, including its acquisition of Western Refining Inc., which they expect will diversify its growth opportunities. The S&P 500  was flat.

Energy stocks sink as crude oil prices tumble below $50 a barrel
Shares of oil companies were broadly and sharply lower Thursday, after OPEC's decision to extend its production plan, rather than cut it, sent crude oil prices tumbling below $50 a barrel. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  dropped 1.4%, bucking the rally in the broader stock market, with 32 of its 34 equity components trading lower. Among the biggest losers and most-active shares, Transocean Ltd.  sank 6.2%, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  slid 5.3% and Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 5.2%. Among the ETF's most-heavily weighted, shares of Exxon Mobil Corp.  dropped 0.7%, Chevron Corp.  shed 1% and Schlumberger Ltd.  gave up 2.2%. The two XLE gainers were shares of Kinder Morgan Inc. , up 0.3% and Tesoro Corp. , up 2.3%. July crude oil futures  plunged 4.8% to $48.91 a barrel. While the XLE tumbled, the S&P 500 rallied 0.4% toward a record close.

Oil stocks surge after Saudis, Russians endorse extension of production cuts
Energy stocks were broadly and sharply higher Monday, as a big rally in crude oil prices helped light a fire under the sector. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  ran up 1.4% in morning trade, making it by far the biggest gainer among trackers of the S&P 500's 11 key sectors. Crude oil futures shot up 3.3%, after the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia said they endorsed a nine-month extension to production cuts agreed upon by OPEC. Oil and gas explorer Marathon Oil Corp.'s stock  surged 5.2% to pace the S&P 500's  advancers. Among shares of other top S&P 500 gainers, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  ran up 3.6%, Transocean Ltd.  climbed 3.5%, Helmerich & Payne Inc.  rallied 3.3%, Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 3.3% and Hess Corp.  gained 3.1%. The energy ETF closed at a nine-month low of $66.26 as recently as May 4, down 15% from an 18-month high of $77.83 on Dec. 13.

Stock market rebounds as energy stocks on pace for biggest daily jump in months
A popular way to bet on energy stocks on Wednesday was on track to see its best one-day climb in two months, as crude-oil prices jumped following an upbeat U.S. inventory report. The exchange-traded Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was up 1.6% in recent trade, marking its best daily rise since a 2.2% climb March 15, with U.S. crude-oil prices  up 2.8% at $47.15 a barrel in late-morning trade after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday showed that domestic crude supplies dropped by 5.2 million barrels for the week ended May 5. Markets have been dogged by concerns about oversupply in the oil industry, which has weighed on investor sentiment and caused a steady retreat in oil prices. A 6% climb in shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  led the exchange-traded fund's components. The S&P 500's energy sector was the best performer among its 11 sectors. Another popular oil fund, United States Oil Fund LP , was on track for its best daily gain since Jan. 11. Stocks paring early losses, with the S&P 500 index  trading flat at 2,395. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was being buoyed by blue-chip components Chevron Corp.  and Caterpillar Inc. , while the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  was trading near break-even. The trading action comes in the wake of President Donald Trump's late-Tuesday firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, which rattled Washington and has cast some doubt on the president's ability to get market-friendly legislation implemented. Oil's recent climb has helped to mitigate some of that early selling pressure.

Energy stocks rally to lead S&P 500 gainers as oil erases some of Thursday's loss
Energy stocks rallied to lead S&P 500 gainers Friday, rebounding from a rout Thursday driven by a steep decline in oil prices. Crude futures were back in the black Friday after a nearly 5% decline in the prior session, although prices were on track for a hefty loss for the week. Oil has suffered "heavy losses this week as investors are no longer pleased with current output cuts by OPEC," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, as reported by MarketWatch. Futures were up 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $46.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Against that backdrop, Transocean Ltd  led the advancers with a 7.4% gain. Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was up 5.4%, NRG Energy Inc.  was up 3% and Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 2.5%. National Oilwell Varco Inc.  added 2.3%, TechnipFMC Plc  rose 2.2% and Hess Corp.  tacked on 2.1%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 0.8%. The S&P 500  was slightly higher.

Why Queenslanders should compare electricity plans
When it comes to finding a great value power plan in Queensland, there are more choices now than ever before.
The retail energy market in South East Queensland (e.g. Brisbane, Ipswich, Gold Coast) is deregulated. This means that the retailers set the price of their products; not the government. If you live in regional Queensland, prices continue to be regulated by the State Government.
Now that there’s increased competition in SEQ, it’s important to review your household’s power plan and see if there’s anything better. Our service outlines discounts, annual savings, and more – no matter what kind of contract you’re currently on. Learn more >

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

Current operations[edit]
The company's properties are divided into two operating segments: the Southern Division and the Northern Division.[1]
The northern division, which accounted for 42% of total production volumes in 2015 and 39% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania (18% of total proved reserves)[1]
Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania (17% of total proved reserves)[1]
Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming[1]

The southern division, which accounted for 58% of total production volumes in 2015 and 61% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, includes the acreage in the following areas:

Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (24% of total proved reserves)[1]
Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle[1]
Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas[1]
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas[1]

In 2015, the company produced 679 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (4,150,000 GJ) per day, which was 72% natural gas, 17% petroleum, and 11% natural gas liquids.[1]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.504 billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.20×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 73% was natural gas and 27% was petroleum and natural gas liquids.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1989 by Aubrey McClendon and Tom L. Ward with only a $50,000 initial investment. McClendon named the company due to his love of the Chesapeake Bay region.[2] Ward later left the company to found SandRidge Energy.

1990s

By the time the company went public via an initial public offering in 1993, it was valued at $25 million.[3]
Focusing on a strategy of drilling horizontal natural gas wells in unconventional reservoirs, the company built a sizable position in the Golden Trend and Sholem Alechem fields of South-central Oklahoma and in the Giddings field of Southeast Texas.[4]
In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to extend the Austin Chalk play into western and central Louisiana but struggled to do so.[5]
In 1997, the company wrote down the value of its assets by over $200 million (approximately equal to shareholder's equity at the time) due to low commodity prices and implemented a turnaround plan.[6]

2000s

The rise in natural gas prices in the early 2000s allowed the company to focus drilling in areas that were previously not economically feasible. The company focused on unconventional drilling in carbonates, tight sandstone, and shale particularly in the Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale.[4]
In 2006, Chesapeake was added to the S&P 500, replacing Dana Holding Corporation.[7]
In 2008, Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana.[8]
The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 by partnering with Orange County Choppers to create the world’s first chopper powered by compressed natural gas.[9]

2010s

In June 2012, the company appointed Archie W. Dunham as chairman, replacing Aubrey McClendon, who retained his position as CEO. Dunham, who retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips in 2004, was appointed in response to shareholder concerns about corporate governance issues under McClendon's watch.[10]
In December 2012, the company sold midstream assets for $2.16 billion.[11]
On April 1, 2013, Aubrey McClendon was forced to leave the company when revelations that McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans from banks that also financed the company.[12][13]
In May 2013, Robert Douglas Lawler was named as McClendon's successor. At the time of the announcement, Lawler was the senior vice president of international and deepwater operations at Anadarko Petroleum. Steven Dixon, Chesapeake's chief operating officer, acted as interim CEO during the replacement search period and, at the time of his appointment in late March, a three-person office of the chairman, consisting of Dixon, Chairmen Archie Dunham and Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, was formed.[14]
In 2013, Chesapeake sold 55,000 net acres in the Northern Eagle Ford Shale and 9,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale to EXCO for aggregate proceeds of $1 billion.[15]
In 2014, Chesapeake sold a large portion of its oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale to Southwestern Energy for net proceeds of $4.975 billion. The transaction included approximately 413,000 net acres and 1,500 wells in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. Net production of the sold assets was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014.[16]
In 2014, the company also sold additional midstream assets for $520 million.[17]
In September 2015, the company announced layoffs of hundreds of people in Oklahoma City.[18]
On March 2, 2016, former CEO and co-founder Aubrey McClendon died in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment in Oklahoma City.[19][20] It occurred the day after a Justice Department federal grand jury had indicted McClendon for violating antitrust laws during his leadership at Chesapeake.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Antitrust allegations[edit]
Alleged collusion and fraud charges in Michigan[edit]
In mid-2012, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into whether Encana, Canada's largest natural gas company, "illegally colluded with Chesapeake Energy Corp to lower the price of Michigan exploration lands during a public land auction in May 2010." Encana's internal investigation determined in 2012 that it did not collude with Chesapeake.[21]
The Federal investigation ended in 2014.[22]
On June 5, 2014, the state of Michigan filed felony fraud and racketeering charges against Chesapeake Energy, alleging that the company canceled hundreds of land leases on false pretenses after it sought to obtain oil and gas rights.[23] Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette claimed that the company "obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land." Chesapeake Energy disputed all charges.[24]
In 2015, the company settled related lawsuits by agreeing to pay $25 million as compensation to landowners with leases.[13]
Underpayment of royalties to landowners[edit]
The company faces thousands of lawsuits in Texas regarding the alleged under-payment of royalties due to individuals that rented land to the company.[25]
Alleged collusion in Oklahoma[edit]
On March 1, 2016, a US Justice Department federal grand jury indicted Aubrey McClendon, co-founder and ex-CEO of the company for allegedly rigging the bidding process for land leases while CEO of the company from December 2007 through March 2012.[13] The indictment says McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies, not named in the indictment, colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of land in northwestern Oklahoma.[19] According to the indictment, the companies would decide ahead of time who would win bids, with the winner then allocating an interest in the leases to the other company, eliminating open competitive bidding.[26] The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”[13]
McClendon died the next day, on March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his vehicle straight into a concrete bridge embankment.[19] Later that day, the Oklahoma City Police said it was too early to say if the collision was intentional. The charges were dropped by the Justice Department as a result of the death.[27]
Possible conflicts of interest by Ex-CEO Aubrey McClendon[edit]

McClendon nominated several of his friends, including long time childhood friends, to the board of the company and made them the highest-paid directors in the petroleum industry. In return, the board made McClendon the highest paid CEO of any S&P 500 company, awarding him a salary of $112 million.[28]
McClendon had the company develop a shopping center near the company's headquarters and lease space to restaurants part-owned by McClendon. The company used these restaurants for millions of dollars worth of catering business.[28]
McClendon and his family frequently used private jets owned by the company for personal reasons. McClendon has stated that this was allowed per his employment agreement.[28]
When McClendon needed money, he convinced the board to have the company purchase his collection of rare maps hanging in the company's offices for $12 million.[28]
An entire department at the company, known as "AKM Operations" was dedicated to working on personal projects of McClendon, including having his house fixed after a hail storm.[29]
The company signed an agreement to pay $3 million per year for the naming and branding rights to the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Oklahoma City Thunder play. The company also committed to buy $3 million worth of tickets per year. McClendon owned a 19% interest in the team.[29]
Since McClendon was a history major and loved history, he hired a company historian, who made over $100,000 per year.[29] He also hired the World's Strongest Man, who also made over $100,000 per year, to promote exercise among company staff.[29]
McClendon borrowed as much as US$1.1 billion against his 2.5% stake in thousands of company wells from banks that were also lenders to the company. Through the Founders Well Participation Program, McClendon was able to purchase a 2.5% interest in every well the company drills.[30] After this potential conflict was made public, the company terminated the Founders Well Participation Program.[31] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an informal inquiry of McClendon's borrowing practices.[32] but no enforcement action was taken.[33]

Lobbying[edit]
In 2004, then CEO Aubrey McClendon contributed $450,000 to the campaign of Tom Corbett for attorney general of Pennsylvania. These funds were credited as giving Corbett a narrow win in the election. When Corbett eventually became governor of Pennsylvania, he was very supportive of Chesapeake's fracking activity in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was the only state without a severance tax on drillers, despite the fact that the budget for education was being reduced.[34]
In 2008, then CEO Aubrey McClendon formed American Clean Skies Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on selling the virtues of natural gas. The foundation was funded by the company and by McClendon. The foundation was criticized for doing nothing but pushing Congress to pass policies that benefited the company and McClendon's business interests.[35]
Environmental damage[edit]
Discharges of fill material[edit]
In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency levied a fine of $3.2 million on a subsidiary of the company and forced it to spend $6.5 million "to restore 27 sites damaged by unauthorized discharges of fill material into streams and wetlands".[36]
Bradford County, Pennsylvania well blowout[edit]
On April 19, 2011, due to a failed seal assembly in a wellhead, the company lost control of a natural gas well in the Marcellus shale that was being fracture stimulated, causing a large spill of salt water and hazardous chemicals, such as 2-butoxyethanol and methanol, into the surrounding countryside.[37][38][39][40] By April 22, 2011, the leak had been stemmed.[41]
The state of Maryland announced its intention to sue the company for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act since fracking fluids from the well blowout wound up in the Chesapeake Bay.[42]
Landslide[edit]
In 2015, the company was fined $1.4 million in Pennsylvania for a landslide caused by the company in 2011 that resulted in clogged waterways.[43]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2014, the company was ranked #51 on Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For List.[44]
In 2009, at the annual Platts Global Energy Awards, the company was named the 2009 Energy Producer at the Year and received the Industry Leadership Award. The company was also a finalist in the Deal of the Year, CEO of the Year, and Community Development Program of the Year categories.[45] In 2012, the company received an Award of Excellence.[46]
In 2007, the company was named the “Best Managed Oil-and-Gas Company” by Forbes Magazine.[47]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2011, Chesapeake Energy agreed to a 12-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder for naming and branding rights of the Chesapeake Energy Arena at a cost of $3 million per year, with annual increases of 3%.[48]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
