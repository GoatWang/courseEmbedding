		Hormel changes business structure

		Oct. 11, 2011

Share This:






AUSTIN, MINN. — Hormel Foods Corp. is changing some of its business structure starting at the end of October with the Grocery Products and Consumer Products Sales segments reporting to Steven G. Binder. 
With the change in structure, Mr. Binder has been promoted to executive vice-president and president of Hormel business units, and he will continue to be responsible for the company’s Refrigerated Foods business segment. Mr. Binder, who has been with the company since 1979, most recently was group vice-president of Refrigerated Foods. 
“We are excited to deploy Steve’s many talents to this broader area of our business,” said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. “This change aligns with our efforts to create a more unified approach to the marketing and sales of Hormel and other branded products and will also support our ability to optimize raw materials.” 
Additionally, Michael D. Tolbert, group vice-president of Specialty Foods, is retiring at the end of the year. Donald H. Kremin will replace him, and Patrick J. Connor will take Mr. Kremin’s responsibilities as vice-president of Hormel Foods and senior vice-president of consumer products sales for the Wal-Mart business starting at the end of October.
