                           "John Biggs tackles how academics can improve their teaching in today's circumstances of large classes and diverse student
                              populations. His approach is practical but not prescriptive. Teachers need to make decisions on teaching and assessment methods
                              to suit their own circumstances. In order to do that they need a conceptual framework to inform their decision-making. Such
                              a framework is clearly described and exemplified by this book. University teachers can readily adapt the ideas here to their
                              own subjects and teaching conditions."--Jacket

                           Educational Psychology Series: Evaluating the Quality of Learning: The SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome)
                              focuses on the approaches, methodologies, and techniques employed in the valuation of the quality of learning. The publication
                              first offers information on the quality and quantity of learning and origin and description of the Structure of the Observed
                              Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy. Discussions focus on general intellectual development and the growth of quality; some assumptions
                              and applications of stage theory; from developmental stage to levels of learning quality; and general intellectual development
                              and the growth of quality. The text then examines the teaching of history, elementary mathematics, English, and geography.
                              Topics include interpreting a map and drawing conclusions, explaining a natural phenomenon, appreciation of poetry, implications
                              for the teaching of history, English, and mathematics, numbers and operations, and general application of SOLO to history.
                              The manuscript takes a look at modern languages, place of the taxonomy in instructional design, and some methodological considerations.
                              Concerns include alternative formats for obtaining SOLO responses, instructional processes, curriculum analysis, remediation,
                              and teacher intentions. The publication is a vital source of data for educators interested in the SOLO taxonomy

                           A comprehensive textbook for general introductory courses in Educational Psychology for both preservice teacher training (Dip.
                              Teach., B. Ed., Dip. Ed.) and inservice teacher education courses. The book is research based with references to over 600
                              studies, but this material is organized to support the discussion of the core topic of each chapter. Chapters are divided
                              in Sections A and B. In Section A the general theory underlying the topic is explored; Section B then discusses the topic
                              in terms of practical classroom experience, the local variations in the Australian scene, and the particular issues and controversies
                              in recent Australian educational practice

                           "This is the first book to paint a clear, research based picture of how Chinese students and their teachers see the context
                              and content of their learning both in Hong Kong and abroad. The focus of much of this research is the question 'How can Chinese
                              learners be so successful academically (often outperforming their Western peers) when their teaching and learning seems to
                              be so oriented to rote memorization?'" "It is concluded that at the heart of this paradox are cross-cultural differences in
                              the very processes of teaching and learning, particularly concerning the relationship between memorizing and understanding
                              and the nature of motivation. Widely held Western stereotypes and misconceptions of Chinese learners are shown to be largely
                              without foundation."--BOOK JACKET

                           The 11 chapters in this book, each contributed by a different author, are organized around the "3p model" of learning at the
                              college level developed by John Biggs, which allows teachers to monitor and modify their teaching in light of students' learning.
                              The 3p model includes presage (student and situational variables), process (how students go about learning), and product (student
                              learning outcomes). The book also discusses the Structures of Observed Learning Outcomes (solo) taxonomy as an alternative
                              to Bloom's model and as a possible basis for assessing learning. The book's chapters are organized into five parts, three
                              of which reflect the parts of the 3p model, the fourth which encompasses the whole model, and the fifth which integrates the
                              preceding chapters and highlights implications for teachers. The chapters are: (1) "Teaching Beliefs and Their Impact on Students'
                              Approach to Learning" (David Kember); (2) "Approaches To Teaching Creative Writing" (Elaine Martin, Paul Ramsden); (3) "a
                              Medley of Individual Differences" (J.H.F. Meyer); (4) "Approaches to Learning and Forms of Understanding" (Noel Entwistle);
                              (5) "Effects of Collaborative Learning on the Quality of Assignments" (Catherine Tang); (6) "Assessing Approaches to Learning:
                              a Cross-Cultural Perspective" (David Watkins); (7) "The solo Model: Addressing Fundamental Measurement Issues" (John Hattie
                              and Nola Purdie); (8) "Towards a Theory of Quality in Higher Education" (Ference Marton); (9) "Applying the solo Taxonomy
                              to Learning in Higher Education" (Gillian Boulton-Lewis); (10) "Teaching for Improved Learning in Small Classes" (Barry Dart);

                              conduct their teaching. Differences between Chinese and Western approaches to teaching are identified, and lessons are drawn
                              for educational reform

                              The writers discuss: how students build knowledge, rather than just absorb it; how students approach learning within the constraints
                                 of what happens in their classrooms; how schools transmit the values that make for good learning; how teachers can be helped
                                 by a study of problem solving, strategy training and planning techniques; how students can learn through reading; how good
                                 learning can take place in our present school systems; and how schools can be changed to make learning more effective

                              This manual describes the theory behind the Study Process Questionnaire (spq) and explains what the subscale and scale scores
                                 mean. The spq is a 42-item self-report questionnaire used in Australia to assess the extent to which a tertiary student at
                                 a college or university endorses different approaches to learning and the motives and strategies comprising those approaches.
                                 The spq yields scores on three basic motives for learning and three learning strategies, and on the approaches to learning
                                 that are formed by these motives and strategies. The three important approaches to learning are categorized as: (1) surface--meeting
                                 the minimum requirements; (2) deep--an intrinsic interest in what is learned; and (3) achieving--enhancing ego and self-esteem
                                 through the competition for grades. The spq operationalizes these approaches and their constituent motives and strategies
                                 in terms of scale and subscale profiles representing an individual's general orientation toward learning. Directions for administering,
                                 scoring, and interpreting scores are given, with suggestions about how they may be used by teachers and counselors. Statistical
                                 information about reliability and validity, four data tables, five figures, and 16 tables of norms are provided. Norms are
                                 given separately for males and females; for colleges and universities; and for faculties of arts, education, and science.

                              "Chris Wong is brought up to believe that if he studies hard, he will find his golden house, and the right girl to share it
                                 with him. But his sexual awakening is complicated by the political realities of modern Hong Kong and traditional Chinese beliefs
                                 on love, marriage and career. He finds that when Chinese and Westerners fall in love, their different views on sex and commitment
                                 all too easily lead to misunderstanding and pain. The author has painted a convincing picture of Hong Kong, capturing its
                                 atmosphere and the culture of its people, giving the reader an insight into life in this city-state."--Publisher's description

                              The learning of different school subjects (history, English, poetry appreciation, creative writing, reading, elementary school
                                 mathematics, geography, and modern languages) can be evaluated qualitatively, using the Structure of the Observed Learning
                                 Outcome (solo) Taxonomy. The taxonomy is structured into five major levels, with transitional responses sometimes identifiable
                                 between levels: (1) pre-structural; (2) uni-structural; (3) multi-structural; (4) relational; and (5) extended abstract. These
                                 hierarchical levels reflect the quality of learning of a particular episode or task. This taxonomy is particulary well-suited
                                 to the receptive learning of a finite display of information (for content analysis, such as a prose passage) or of a complex
                                 set of skills (for process analysis, such as mathematical problem solving). (Several implications for curriculum, instruction,
                                 and evaluation are discussed.) (Author/GDC)

                              From Ashes to Ashes tells the story of Peter Morrison, a school teacher in rural New South Wales. His childhood is marred
                                 by WWII, and as he comes of age, Peter veers from his conservative parents' values. While he becomes a teacher with a family,
                                 he is also drawn into an affair, causing classroom scandal. With maturity, Peter rights his choices, retiring as a respected
                                 school principal. However, finally verging on dementia, he veers again from sanity

                                            Burville J. Bradford, known to many as "Brad", passed onto the Lord on Tuesday, August 31, 2010, at the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, at the age of 84. 

He was born July 9, 1926, to Floy and Herman.  After Herman passed away, Floy remarried Alton Gideon and moved to Concord, California.  Brad attended Mt. DeOblo Schools and at the age of 18, he entered the Army.    While serving in Japan, he met Bonnie Bonar at a hospital in Osaka, where he was a patient and she was a nurse.  They became engaged and married after their honorable discharges in Algona, Iowa on September 21, 1946.

Brad worked most of his life in the auto repair business.  He received his training working at Dau's Garage in Algona.  He later became partners with his son Jim and they opened their own shop at Hobarton, Iowa, doing both auto body and motor repairs.  Brad also loved the races and really enjoyed helping his son Jim with his racing career.

Brad retired in 1990, but actually painted his last vehicle at the age of 81.  Brad and Bonnie entered the VA Center in Marshalltown and finished out their retirement together.  Bonnie later passed away in 2001.  During the past years, you would likely find Brad watching NASCAR and Indy races on TV or doing volunteer work at the Center.  Brad loved his family, especially all of his grand and great-grandchildren.  He was full of smiles and laughter when they visited.

Brad is survived by his two sons Robert (Linda) of Lexington, KY and James (Linda) of Oskaloosa, IA; a daughter Kay of Humboldt, IA; seven grandchildren; twelve great-grandchildren; ten great-step-grandchildren; one sister, Roma Kissenger of Sacramento, CA; and a half-brother, John Gideon of Belavista, AK.  He was proceeded in death by his wife, mother, father, and step-father.
