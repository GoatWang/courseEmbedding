Had a little rattle in my Marshall Class 5 amp. Brought it in and the guys at Randee’s helped me out super fast and super friendly. Definitely the only place to go for your guitar needs.

I recently dealt with Randee’s for a sight unseen high end guitar purchase.  Communication was superb and the guitar I purchased was as was expected.  With their 7 day review policy it took the worry out of the deal.  Their staff are knowledgeable and helpful and also followed up on the purchase after the fact.  Not many do that.

What a Fantastic experience at Randee’s Music! I was kept informed on when it as shipped to them and the day it came in Lincoln set it up! Lincoln is very knowledgeable and helped put this combo together, and to top it off the prices were the best around, even online! They have a huge selection of guitars, amps, bags, strings etc. If you like music, this is the place to shop. Customer service is top rated at Randee’s. Thank you Lincoln!

Recently purchased an Epiphone Les Paul tribute. Very knowledgeable staff will help you all you want or let you go on your own. I found very competitive pricing. Also if you need service they will take care of you.
We all need to support our local merchants!

A purchase that I wish I could give you guys DOUBLE positive feedback! You did a fantastic job on accurate photos, great setup, fast / safe delivery. I have played this guitar everyday since receiving it: truly a wonderful Muse! Hope to deal with you again.

…Randee’s Music Center treats you like a person, and not  like a number by an order taker. Randee’s take into account your wants, needs…Courteous and knowledgeable staff…Competitive prices…I purchased a Yamaha Clavinova from Randee’s because I did not want to end up penny smart, but pound foolish.

5 stars all the way! Prompt & Safe shipment! Good Value! Well pleased!
