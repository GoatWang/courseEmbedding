Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Bellicum Seeks Acquisitions
Jun 28 17
Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGM:BLCM) is seeking acquisitions. Bellicum has filed a shelf registration for up to $150 million of combination of securities. Bellicum intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for general corporate purposes, which may include research and development, capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses.

Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Reports Clinical Results of BPX-501 in Pediatric Leukemias at the 22nd Congress of the European Hematology Association
Jun 23 17
Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced data from its ongoing multicenter BP-004 trial of BPX-501 and rimiducid in a cohort of pediatric patients with acute leukemias who lack a matched donor. Results from 47 patients demonstrated that administering BPX-501 following an alpha/beta T-cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alpha/beta T-cell depleted haplo-HSCT) produced rapid immune reconstitution, low incidence of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), and a low rate of disease relapse. The data will be reviewed in an oral presentation at the 22nd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) at 5 p.m. CEST on June 24 in Madrid, Spain. Investigators evaluated the safety and efficacy of an infusion of BPX-501 in children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=28) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=19) following an alpha/beta T-cell depleted haplo-HSCT. Patients had a median follow-up of approximately eight months (11 months in surviving patients). Results from the three European trial sites showed: Disease relapse rate of 14.72% in BPX-501 treated patients; Median neutrophil recovery = 16 days (9-24); median platelet engraftment = 11 days (8-19); median time to hospital discharge = 21.5 days (14-103); Acute GvHD Grade 2-4 was 11.83%; acute GvHD Grade 3-4 was 4.70%; Chronic GvHD Grade Moderate-Severe was 3.23%; Non-relapse mortality (NRM) of 3.23% in BPX-501 patients; Re-expansion of infection-fighting BPX-501 cells after a sharp decrease following infusion of rimiducid, with no reoccurrence of GvHD; and Results compare favorably to historic controls.

					Full Description



Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on July 14, 2004, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on discovering and developing cellular immunotherapies for various forms of cancer, including hematological cancers and solid tumors, as well as orphan inherited blood disorders. The Company uses its chemical induction of dimerization (CID) technology platform to engineer and then control components of the immune system. The Company is developing next-generation product candidates in the areas of cellular immunotherapy, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T cells therapy and T-cell receptor (TCR) cell therapies. The Company's product candidates include BPX-501, BPX-601 and BPX-701. The Company's CID-based technologies include CaspaCIDe and GoCAR-T.The Company's technology, CaspaCIDe, is its safety switch, incorporated into its HSCT and TCR product candidates. CaspaCIDe is designed to eliminate cells in the event of toxicity. The CaspaCIDe switch consists of the CID-binding domain coupled to the signaling domain of iCaspase, an enzyme that is part of the apoptotic, cell death pathway. Infusion of rimiducid is designed to trigger activation of the domain of iCaspase, which in turn leads to selective apoptosis of the CaspaCIDe-containing cells. The Company's lead product candidate, BPX-501, is an adjunct T cell therapy administered after allogeneic HSCT using genetically modified donor T cells incorporating its CaspaCIDe safety switch. BPX-501, in combination with rimiducid, is granted orphan drug designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of immunodeficiency and graft versus host disease (GvHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The Company is evaluating BPX-501 in various Phase I/II clinical trials in adults and pediatric patients with leukemias, lymphomas and genetic blood diseases in the United States and Europe.BPX-601 is a GoCAR-T product candidate containing the Company's inducible MyD88/CD40 (iMC), activation switch, designed to treat solid tumors expressing prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). PSCA is a cancer antigen expressed in many malignancies, including prostate, pancreatic, bladder, esophagus, and gastric cancers. The Company focuses on developing BPX-601 for the treatment of non-resectable pancreatic cancer. The Company is developing BPX-701, a TCR-based therapy that incorporates its CaspaCIDe technology. BPX-701 is designed to target malignant cells expressing the preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME). The Company focuses on developing BPX-701 for the treatment of refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The Company also focuses on developing BPX-701 for the treatment of for metastatic uveal melanoma.The Company competes with Kiadis Pharma Netherlands B.V. and Molecular Medicine S.p.A.

Better Buy: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vs. Kite Pharma
Is Bellicum Pharmaceuticals or Kite Pharma the better adoptive T-cell therapy stock to buy? 











                George Budwell
            

                (TMFGBudwell)



            
            Mar 29, 2017 at 8:42AM
            
            





The next shoe is set to drop in the high-flying immuno-oncology space, with genetically modified cell therapies close to becoming a reality. As these therapies are forecast to quickly become one of the fastest-growing segments of the $100 billion oncology market in the next few years, investors may want to consider taking a position in this emerging field before the first therapy reaches the market. 
Armed with this insight, let's consider if the small-cap Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BLCM) or the mid-cap Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) is the better adoptive-cell therapy stock to buy.  

Image source: Getty Images.

Bellicum is a promising small-cap immunotherapy company
Bellicum is a small-cap biotech developing a host of genetically modified cell-based therapies for blood disorders and various cancers. While cell-based immunotherapies are now a common feature of many pharma pipelines, Bellicum stands apart from the crowd because of its proprietary "chemical induction of dimerization" (CID) technology that's designed to enhance the safety and efficacy profiles of these novel cancer-fighting cell therapies.
Specifically, the biotech's cellular therapies incorporate a molecular switching mechanism that can be triggered by a small molecule known as rimiducid to either induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the event of a safety issue, or cause the infused cells to proliferate to enhance potency. 
Using its CID platform, Bellicum designed its lead T-cell therapy product candidate, BPX-501, to improve patient outcomes during a half-matched T-depleted, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) -- a process that involves the intravenous infusion of stem cells as a way to restart the production of blood cells in patients with bone-marrow or immune-system disorders.
Although half-matched HSCT can be life-saving in many instances, this procedure does have serious life-threatening drawbacks, such as graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) or an increased risk of infection from the eradication of T-cells before infusion. BPX-501's built-in safety switch, however, should solve this problem by lowering the risk of uncontrolled bouts of GvHD, while still allowing patients to benefit from a higher T-cell count.
The good news is that the therapy's early-stage results across a range of rare blood disorders are proving to be a game changer for many HSCT patients. As such, Bellicum is hoping to file for BPX-501's first regulatory approval in the EU by mid-2018 and nail down an acceptable regulatory pathway for the therapy in the U.S. by the middle of this year.
The downside, though, is that the biotech's cash runway probably isn't sufficient to see it all the way through to BPX-501's worldwide commercialization. Bellicum, after all, has around $150 million remaining in cash following its latest secondary offering, but it also has a quarterly burn rate of around $20 million that's bound to grow as its clinical activities expand into late-stage development. 
Kite Pharma may gain the all-important first-mover advantage soon
After a quarter-century of development of adoptive T-cell therapies in general, Kite Pharma is now in prime position to bring the first chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (or CAR-T) therapy to market with its experimental aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treatment called Axi-Cel (formerly KTE-C19). At the time of writing, Kite was expected to wrap up Axi-Cel's full regulatory filing with the FDA within just a matter of days (before the end of March), putting it well ahead of Novartis and Juno Therapeutics' rival CAR-T candidates.
The point is that Kite is set to be the first company to establish a foothold in a brand-new oncology market that should easily be worth hundreds of billions in sales over the next decade. Moreover, Axi-Cel's first indication isn't a token one. If approved as a later-line treatment for aggressive NHL, this novel cell therapy is expected to haul in between $181 million and $482 million in 2018, depending on its price and the scale of Kite's initial commercial launch.  
Having said that, Kite is far from a slam-dunk buy. Like all other CAR-T therapies to date, Axi-Cel does have serious life-threatening side effects, including cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity, and this therapy lacks a top-flight molecular safety switch. So while its overall risk-vs.-reward profile may warrant an approval, there's no telling how doctors will view the therapy's clear-cut trade-offs in the real world. 
Kite must also overcome the inherent problems associated with manufacturing an adoptive T-cell therapy on a commercial scale. Put simply, you have to be able to harvest a patient's own T-cells, ship them to your production facility to genetically modify them, and then ship them back to the clinic where the patient is being treated. That's not an impossible feat to overcome, but it's also a far cry from simply brewing a batch of pills, or even manufacturing most other biological-based drugs. 
On the bright side, Kite is in a fairly strong financial position, exiting the most recent quarter with over $414 million in cash and no debt. And that's before the company rolled out a $410 million public stock offering in the first quarter of 2017. So the company should have the resources to execute Axi-Cel's commercial launch if it gains an approval later this year, as well as continue advancing its other clinical candidates. 





Which stock is the better buy?
While Kite's possible first-mover advantage is certainly important, Bellicum appears to have the best-in-class technology with its CID platform. And that's absolutely key.
The underlying reason adoptive-cell therapies took so long to move from the bench to the market is their deadly side effects. Kite, for its part, has been able to reduce these life-threatening side effects to manageable levels in the clinic, but that's not a guarantee this line will hold once Axi-Cel is used more broadly.
Juno Therapeutics' lead clinical candidate, JCAR015, after all, was ultimately shelved after it apparently led to a handful of deaths in a trial for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and that's been par for the course with these therapies. In other words, history is not on Kite's side when it comes to the current generation of CAR-T therapies. 
So Bellicum's next-generation adoptive-cell therapy product candidates -- along with Juno and Kite's, for that matter -- that incorporate more robust safety features are probably the way to go if you're looking to invest in this emerging space. Point blank: This rush to market for a technology with known safety issues is a highly questionable strategy that has the potential to backfire in a big way. 
In all, Bellicum comes out the winner in this match because of its patience and better long-term prospects from a safety standpoint.

Better Buy: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc. vs. bluebird bio Inc.
Several of the most interesting drugs in development belong to Bellicum and bluebird bio, but which is the better stock pick right now?











                Cory Renauer
            

                (TMFang4apples)



            
            Mar 6, 2017 at 9:42AM
            
            





Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:BLCM) and bluebird bio Inc. (NASDAQ:BLUE) occupy an interesting corner of the biotech industry. Both clinical-stage biotechs are developing cellular therapies for the treatment of blood disorders and cancer.
Neither has an approved product to sell, although candidates winding their way through development stages could generate billions. Let's see how the potential new therapies they have in development measure up to see which of these stocks is the better pick at the moment.

Image source: Getty Images.

Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc.: Under control
Bellicum's lead candidate, BPX-501, is a novel solution to a common problem. Stem-cell transplants can effectively treat a range of blood-based diseases, but using donor cells from a less-than-perfect match is so dangerous that the procedure is severely limited.
The most lethal complication that arises when transplanting stem cells from less than perfectly matched donors is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an immune-system attack on donor stem cells. Recipients typically undergo immune-cell depletion ahead of transplants to avoid GVHD, which presents complications of its own.
Bellicum's candidate involves modifying donor immune cells with a kill switch that healthcare providers can activate with simple administration of rimiducid. In an ongoing trial with 122 pediatric patients receiving partially matched donor stem-cell transplants, five cases of uncontrolled GVHD were resolved by activating the shut-off switch.
Bellicum has also begun human trials with BPX-601 for the treatment of inoperable pancreatic cancer, a disease with tremendous unmet need. The candidate involves modifying immune cells to attack tumors expressing a specific target on their surfaces. There are a handful of biotechs advancing chimeric antigen receptor modified T-cells (CAR-T) through clinical trials, but BPX-601 has a unique safety switch similar to BPX-501.

Image source: Getty Images.

Bellicum's controllable CAR-T technology could become all the rage. These experimental therapies have shown an ability to help patients who had failed numerous lines of treatment with existing drugs. However, some have proven too effective. Rapid cancer-cell destruction has been linked to severe, sometimes fatal, side effects.
bluebird bio Inc.: Another approach
bluebird bio's lead candidate could eventually compete with Bellicum's for patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and severe sickle disease, two inherited disorders caused by faulty hemoglobin genes. Bluebird's LentiGlobin involves reintroducing a patient's own stem cells after they've been modified to produce functional hemoglobin. Perfectly matched stem cells present very little risk of GVHD, which could render Bellicum's lead candidate redundant.
If approved, annual LentiGlobin sales could eventually peak at around $1 billion for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and $3 billion in the larger sickle-cell indication. That makes it the company's most important clinical-stage asset, but it's not the only one with nine-figure annual sales potential.
Bluebird also boasts a CAR-T candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma called bb2121 that could go on to generate about $3.6 billion in annual sales at its peak. Last December, Bluebird presented interim data from a small trial with patients who had relapsed following between five and 13 previous lines of treatment. Despite being so heavily pretreated, seven of nine evaluable patients' disease showed a response.
About a year ago, Celgene exercised an option to develop and possibly commercialize bb2121, and remarkable data suggests the big biotech made a smart decision. The agreement removes a great deal of risk for Bluebird while leaving it eligible for hefty milestone and royalty payments if it succeeds.





The better buy
LentiGlobin and BPX-501 are deep in uncharted waters, and CAR-T therapies are still experimental across the board. While the combination of safety and efficacy we've seen so far is highly encouraging, investors in either company need to brace themselves for regulatory uncertainty.
Should any or all of these biotechs' candidates earn approvals, their commercial viability is another big question mark. Cellular-based therapies present enormous challenges for patients and healthcare providers that you just don't see with simple pills or injections.
With a market cap of about $3.35 billion, Bluebird stock has a long way to fall if it runs into any surprise potholes on the way to Profit Town. Should disaster strike, Bellicum has a much lower perch to fall from, with a recent market cap of just $326 million.
In fact, the smaller company's stock is so cheap that I think it underestimates the safety switch technology's long-term potential and makes the company a potential acquisition target. Add it all up, and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals looks the better buy right now.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
