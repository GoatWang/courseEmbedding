About AIS

AIS Capital Management, L.P. (“AIS”), is an investment management firm focused on absolute-return strategies in global financial markets. Relying on a thorough understanding of the driving forces behind price action in global markets, the investment team has developed and implemented discretionary and systematic global macro strategies that seek to generate alpha over multiple market cycles while minimizing risk.
AIS was founded in 1992 by John Hummel and Brad Stern, both of whom still serve as principals of the firm and its majority owners. These principals together manage AIS’s investment programs. Please visit the AIS Team page for further biographical details.
AIS stands for “Applied Intelligence Strategies,” a term for computer programs that combine the best aspects of sound investment principles with the strict disciplines of mathematics.
 
Independent and well-researched. AIS manages client portfolios based on the principle that successful investing often requires independent thinking to develop appropriate investment strategies. We base our decisions on extensive analysis of global macroeconomic factors and asset valuations, and we draw on decades of investment experience.
Fundamentally driven. AIS’s investment team studies fundamental macroeconomic and intermarket indicators to develop its portfolio views. Its Multi-Asset Allocation Portfolio programs employ a longer-term, discretionary approach, while the Frontera programs follow a systematic interpretation of shorter-term economic fundamentals. In each of its programs, AIS leverages its understanding of the enduring, globally applicable fundamental relationships that impact asset market returns.
Highly liquid and scalable. AIS only invests in highly liquid instruments that trade on major exchanges. 
Transparent and intelligible. In addition, our investment programs are highly transparent. We do not use “black-box” systems, but rather our investment methodologies track logical, fundamental relationships that hold true over multiple market cycles. AIS takes a consultative approach with its clients, providing a detailed explanation of its investment process and views. We believe clients should thoroughly understand our portfolio management decisions and the global macroeconomic outlook that we anticipate during each step of the market cycle.
Flexible and opportunistic. Markets have changed dramatically over the last several decades. Since 2008 in particular, markets have become more highly correlated, and coordinated global monetary policy has heavily influenced market behavior. The ability to move nimbly amongst non-traditional market sectors has become increasingly important. AIS has the advantage of being a smaller firm with great flexibility. We may respond opportunistically to changing market environments. Furthermore, as an independent, privately held firm, AIS does not face the liquidity pressures associated with extended lines of credit.
AIS maintains registrations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as an investment advisor and with the National Futures Association ("NFA") as a Commodity Trading Advisor ("CTA") and Commodity Pool Operator ("CPO") with the "Forex Firm" and "Swap Firm" designations.

Why Invest?

Over time, we believe that AIS’s global macro strategies will add value to a diversified portfolio. Its global macro strategies offer a platform for nimble, tactical investment management across multiple timeframes. The breadth of the programs’ scope and their flexibility provide opportunities in multiple market environments, including, for example, equity bull and bear markets, times of rising and falling interest rates, and period of increasing and decreasing volatility.
Given the firm's differentiated, fundamentally driven approach, AIS has delivered returns that have historically exhibited low correlations with both traditional investments and other global macro and CTA strategies. There is no guarantee, however, that AIS's programs will continue to exhibit low correlations in the future.
AIS’s investment programs track the macroeconomic and market fundamentals that determine asset market returns over the intermediate to long run, in addition to the technical factors that may cause markets to trade away from the fundamentals over the short term.
By studying these enduring, globally applicable fundamental relationships, AIS’s experienced team and rigorous research process stands ready to uncover profitable opportunities through varied market environments. Having seen these linkages hold over multiple decades, the investment team is confident that taking account of these indicators will provide attractive absolute and risk-adjusted returns into the future.
