THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this
“ Agreement ”) is entered into as of July 1st,

AGS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “
Company ”), and Mauro Franic (“ Executive
”).
WHEREAS, the Company desires to
employ Executive as its Chief Operating Officer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement; and
WHEREAS, Executive desires to serve
in such position.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:
1.     
Nature of Employment Relationship . Executive’s
employment with the Company will be “at-will,” meaning
that either Executive or the Company may terminate the employment
relationship at any time and for any reason, either with or without
cause. The “at-will” nature of Executive’s
employment may only be changed in an express written agreement
signed by both Executive and a duly authorized officer of the
Company.

 

2.
     Terms of Employment .

 

(a)
Position;
Location .
During his employment with the Company, Executive shall serve as
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. During his employment, and
excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which Executive
may be entitled, Executive agrees to devote all of his business
attention and time to the business and affairs of the Company and,
to the extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned
to Executive hereunder, to use his reasonable best efforts to
perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. Executive
agrees that he will not engage in any other gainful employment,
business or activity without the written consent of the Company.
Executive’s services shall be performed in the Atlanta,
Georgia area, subject to reasonable business travel at the
Company’s request.

 

(b)
Compensation and
Employee Benefits .

 

(i)
Base
Salary .
Executive shall receive an annual base salary (“ Base
Salary ”) of $300,000, payable in 26 installments in
accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices for
salaried employees. The Base Salary and payment schedule are
subject to adjustment at the sole discretion of the Company. If the
Base Salary is adjusted at the discretion of the Company, the term
“Base Salary” shall refer to such adjusted
amount.

 

(ii)
Annual
Bonus .
Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual performance-based
bonus pursuant to an annual managerial bonus plan to be established
by the Company, with an annual target bonus equal to 75% of
Executive’s Base Salary. Actual annual bonus amounts payable

in its sole discretion based on the attainment of financial results
and earnings targets for the fiscal year in question.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 2(b)(ii),
Executive’s annual bonus in respect of (x) the first half of
fiscal year 2015 shall be $125,000
 


 






 


 

(paid no later than the
second payroll date following the execution of this Agreement);
provided , that if the Executive’s employment with the
Company and its affiliates is terminated for any reason other than
(A) by the Company without “cause” (as defined below)
or (B) due to Executive’s death or becoming Disabled (as
defined below), in either case, prior to the date on which annual
bonuses for fiscal year 2015 are paid to other senior executives of
the Company in the ordinary course of business, Executive will
repay to the Company the after-tax portion of such half-year bonus
( i.e , $125,000 less Executive’s income taxes and
payroll taxes, as calculated by the Company) within 15 days of such
termination, and (y) the second half of fiscal year 2015 shall be
determined under the Company’s annual managerial bonus plan
as described in the preceding provisions of this Section
2(b)(ii).

 

(iii)
Retention
Bonus . The
Company shall pay to Executive lump-sum cash retention bonuses of
(x) $75,000 on December 31 st
, 2015, (y) $150,000 on
December 31 st
, 2016 and (z) $75,000
on July 1, 2017, provided in each case that executive remains
continuously employed with the Company or its affiliates through
such dates. The retention bonuses may be paid within five business
days of the dates indicated in the previous sentence if necessary
for administrative convenience.
 

(iv)
Equity
. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, Executive
shall be granted (a) an option (the “ Time-Based
Option ”) to purchase 75,000 shares of class B non-voting
common stock of AP Gaming Holdco, Inc. (“ Holdco
”) under the AP Gaming Holdco, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive
Plan (the “ Plan ”), subject to
Executive’s execution of a nonqualified stock option
agreement (the “ Time-Based Option Agreement ”)
and the terms and conditions contained therein and in the Plan, and
(b) an option (the “ Performance-Based Option ”)
to purchase 20,000 shares of class B non-voting common stock of
Holdco under the Plan, subject to Executive’s execution of a
nonqualified stock option agreement (the “
Performance-Based Option Agreement ”) and the terms
and conditions contained therein and in the Plan. Subject to
Executive’s continuous employment with the Company or its
affiliates, (x) the Time-Based Option shall vest in equal annual
installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the
Effective Date and (y) the Performance-Based Option shall cliff
vest only upon the Board’s determination, made in its sole
discretion, that Holdco’s EBITDA for fiscal year 2017 was at
least $140,000,000.
 

(v)
Employee Benefit
Plans and Vacation . Executive shall be entitled to
participate in the employee health benefits plan provided by the
Company for employees and eligible family. Executive will also be
eligible for participation in the Company’s 401k plan.
Executive shall be entitled to four (4) weeks paid vacation
annually. Vacation will accrue on a monthly basis. Eligibility for
participation in these benefits will be determined by the
requirements of the plan(s) in effect at the time Executive
commences employment and is subject to adjustment pursuant to the
Company’s policies and plans in effect, which may change from
time to time. Executive shall also be entitled to participate in
employee benefit plans, long term incentive plans, practices,
policies and programs generally applicable to employees of the
Company on the same terms applicable to similarly situated senior
executives of the company.

 

(vi)
Expenses
. Executive shall be
entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable
expenses incurred by Executive in accordance with the
Company’s policies.

 
3.     
Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability .
Executive’s employment shall terminate automatically upon
Executive’s death. If the Company determines in good faith
that the Executive becomes Disabled during the Employment Period
(pursuant to the definition of Disabled set forth below), it may
give to Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 7(b) of this Agreement of its intention to terminate
Executive’s employment. In such event, Executive’s
employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th
day after receipt of such notice by Executive (the “
Disability Effective Date ”) unless,
 


 






 


 

within the 30 days
after such receipt, Executive returns to full-time performance of
Executive’s duties. For purposes of this Agreement, “
Disabled ” shall mean the absence of Executive from
Executive’s duties with the Company on a full-time basis for
90 business days within a one-year period as a result of
incapacity due to mental or physical illness that is determined to
be permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers
and reasonably acceptable to Executive or Executive’s legal
representative.

 

4.    
Severance . In the event Executive is terminated by the
Company without cause, the Company will pay to Executive severance
in an aggregate amount equal to eighteen (18) months of
Executive’s Base Salary (as in effect on the date of
termination of employment). For purposes of this section,
“cause” includes failure to correct underperformance
after written notification from the CEO or Board of Directors of
the Company (the “Board”), illegal and/or fraudulent
conduct, conviction of a felony, a determination that
Executive’s involvement with the Company would have a
negative impact on the Company’s ability to receive or retain
any necessary licenses, willful or material misrepresentation to
the Company, or refusal to take any action as reasonably directed
by the Board or any individual acting on behalf of or at the
direction of the Board. The determination of whether cause exists
shall be made by the Board in its sole discretion. Payment of
severance pursuant to this section is conditioned and contingent
upon (i) the execution and delivery, within 60 days of
Executive’s termination of employment, by Executive of a
waiver and general release in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company that has become irrevocable in
accordance with its terms and (ii) Executive’s continued
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Severance payments
will be made in substantially equal installments consistent with
the Company’s payroll practices during the eighteen-month
period following termination of employment, provided that no
payments shall be made until the first payroll date following the
effective date of such waiver and general release.
 
5.     
Restrictive Covenants .

 

(a)
    
Confidentiality; Work Product . During Executive’s
employment with the Company and its subsidiaries and thereafter,
Executive will not divulge, transmit or otherwise disclose (except
as legally compelled by court order), directly or indirectly, any
confidential knowledge or information with respect to the
operations, finances, organization or employees of the Company or
its affiliates or with respect to trade secret, intellectual
property, confidential processes, services, techniques, customers
or plans with respect to the Company and its affiliates, and
Executive will not use, directly or indirectly, any confidential or
trade secret information of the Company and its affiliates for the
benefit of anyone other than the Company or its affiliates;
provided , however , that Executive’s
employment by a subsequent employer while Executive still has
knowledge of any such confidential or trade secret information
shall not constitute a breach of this provision so long as
Executive does not disclose the same to any third party. All new
processes, techniques, know-how, inventions, plans, products,
patents and devices developed, made or invented by Executive, alone
or with others, while an employee of the Compan

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
