About Us

		The Chilton Publishing Company was founded in 1904 in West Philadelphia, known for
		its picturesque row houses. Chilton soon became a trusted publisher of periodicals,
		especially for automotive repair. The company expanded well beyond the automotive
		industry, providing periodicals, conferences, and market research services to a
		wide variety of industries.

		Throughout those early years, the traditional Chilton standards for accuracy remained
		intact. Chilton delivered reliable information year after year, earning a reputation
		of being trustworthy, similar to the city's most famous founding father, Benjamin
		Franklin.

		After about 50 years in West Philadelphia, the company moved to Radnor, PA, where
		it found space to grow to nearly 900 employees.

		In 1985 Chilton became part of the publicly-traded Capital Cities, which later merged
		with ABC Inc. In 1996, Capital Cities and ABC were bought by the Walt Disney Company.
	

		By 1997, Disney sold the Chilton publishing assets, conference management and market
		research divisions to a variety of firms, splitting up disparate properties.

		In 2003, the Thomson Corporation bought the Chilton automotive assets. It immediately
		invested in the Chilton brand, infusing its technologies and learning competencies
		into the venerable legacy of Chilton automotive content.

		In 2007 Thomson Learning became Cengage Learning. Today Chilton's editors continue
		to carefully craft information so that automotive enthusiasts, students and service
		professionals can rely on the Chilton legacy in information excellence.

		Cengage Learning is proud to be the publisher of Chilton content and products while
		increasingly utilizing technology to better serve today's changing needs.
