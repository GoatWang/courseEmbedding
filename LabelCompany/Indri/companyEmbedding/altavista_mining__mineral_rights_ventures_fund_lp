The Mitchell Group and Redhawk Investment Group Announce Formation of Redhawk Minerals Fund I, LP - STACK Play

DALLAS, Aug. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- N. Malone Mitchell 3rd of The Mitchell Group and Jack Nichols of Redhawk Investment Group announced today the formation of Redhawk Minerals Fund I, LP, a $58,000,000 mineral rights acquisition offering. The partnership management which, with The Mitchell Group, has over 100 years' collective experience in the famously productive STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko basin, Canadian and Kingfisher counties) area in the Anadarko Basin in central Oklahoma is designed to acquire, own and administer mineral interests. Both companies are headquartered in Dallas, Texas.








Redhawk Minerals Management has said timing is perfect now for mineral acquisition as many mineral owners'/sellers' price related expectations generally decline in proportion to the price of oil. This can translate into the ability to acquire acreage at very competitive prices. Unlike many "hot" plays in the US, mineral ownership in the STACK is highly fragmented and many times involve first-time sellers whose ownership could date back to the Oklahoma Sooner Land Rush days in 1889. This may result in smaller individual tracts that often can be acquired at lower prices. Drilling activity in the area is brisk and purchasing mineral rights "in front of the bit" is a goal. 
Mineral rights ownership, as an asset category, is a lesser known form of investment vehicle more commonly found in institutional type offerings. This offering allows qualified private individuals to gain direct entry into mineral rights ownership. As drilling and production occur, mineral rights ownership can provide the opportunity for the owner to receive handsome up-front, lump-sum bonus premiums to lease plus royalty payments, ranging anywhere from 12.5%-25% of the gross revenues from producing properties. This lucrative, passive form of income, combined with mineral owners' bearing no development risk, no drilling risk, no completion risk or dry-hole risks and incurring only nominal costs to carry make it a very attractive opportunity.
Long sought after, mineral rights ownership is one of the truest forms of legacy assets. The mineral rights never expire. Oil companies lease the rights from the mineral owner and pay lucrative bonuses to have the right to drill. When they find oil, the mineral owner will receive royalty checks until the lease is no longer commercially profitable. If the oil company never drills or if their leases expire, the whole lease bonus, royalty payment process can repeat itself.
Nowadays, there are areas where oil and gas development has occurred, primary zones have been depleted by drilling activity, and newly discovered primary and secondary technologies have brought the fields back into production. These recurrent technological advances may allow the mineral owner to repeat the lease bonus and royalty revenue income scenario. The revenue streams can go on for generations.
The STACK play, now in its infancy, is being compared to the early days of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. Large Independent oil companies, like Devon Energy, Cimarex Energy, Continental Resources and Newfield Exploration have significant acreage positions in the play and can average 500 – 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Qualified investors and registered agents are invited to contact the company at 844-952-7363 or by e-mail to InvestorRelations@redhawkinvestmentgroup.com for more information on the offering.

If you own the mineral rights in one or more of these areas, and if your rights are not leased or currently producing, you may well qualify.Q: What kind of dollar amount can I expect to receive for a lump sum one time payment from my mineral rights interest?A: The final amount depends on several variables. Each of these is subject to your particular property. Unleased and open mineral acreage is always of greater worth. If that is the current status of your acreage, you currently stand at a greater advantage to profit.Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer offers TOP PAYMENT  for their client's mineral rights. Call us today to see what that means to you.If your mineral rights are currently Leased we must review your current langued of the negotiated lease. How much was your bonus per acre, How much did you negotiate for the royalty interest if they ever drill a will how much will you receive from the production.If it is Leased or Unleased the main factor can be the are of your minerals. For example their are areas of intrest in oklahoma and in texas at this time the can bring 3 or 4 times of some areas that may only have a value of $300 or $400 per net mineral acre.Oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyers and Oil Gas investors also have a team of experts including a world renowned geologists.

Their is no risk you the mineral owner we incur all risk we pass no cost on to you we will review and evaluate if we can make an offer completely at are own cost. Q: Are there any limits to the amount of acreage you're interested in?A: Whether you have a few acres or several thousand, we are interested in talking with you. Call us for a free no-obligation consultation.Q: If I have only a few acres, will I get the same type treatment as a large mineral owner?A: Regardless of the size of your Net mineral acreage or royalty income position, we treat every clientwith the same importance and respect. Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer prides themselves on their professional approach in serving their many clients.Q: How long of a wait should I expect before seeing any profits?A: If you prefer a quick turnaround, it is best to sell your oil, gas, and mineral rights for their current per acre value. This is fastest way to receive a profit for your mineral ownership. Leasing your mineral rights is another way to profit for your mineral ownership, but that return is subject to future exploration and production volumes.Q: Why can't I represent my own oil, gas, and mineral rights interests?A: Maximizing your mineral rights profits requires an advanced knowledge of the oil, gas, and gas liquids industry. This includes being knowledgeable with each aspect of preproduction, production, transportation, and sales. Being unfamiliar with these issues will grossly affect the ability to maximize your available mineral rights profits. As far as self-production, keep in mind that Oil and gas companies pay a proportionate share of the cost of every well. This usually equates to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. You may be in a position to dothe very same thing, but for the vast majority of mineral rights owners that type of investment is out of the question. The best choice is having Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer act as your expert. Our involvement will help insure that you receive the highest profits from your mineral rights.Purchasing your rights is worth more to us. This is because my call us today and find out what' we could pay now for your rights.Q: Is there any tax benefits to selling your oil, gas, and mineral rights versus collecting royalty income?A: One of the things we hear more than any other is weighing the taxation pros and cons regarding selling minerals verses waiting on the royalty income. Selling these rights is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates. An example of how this works is found in for 2012 capital gains taxes. These taxes have a 15 cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes. Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20 Regardless of whether you are in the lowestincome tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10. Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases can more than double your tax liability. Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.Q: Will my bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling to become a consistent source of income?A: The answer to that question depends solely on the following five points: (1) If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time. (2) If a well is drilled. (3) If that well is not a dry hole. (4) If that well is operated in a prudent manner. (5) And, most importantly, if oil, natural gas, and gas liquids pricing sustains both continued production and the risk of new exploration. Please, remember that no one person or company has control over these variables.Q: What about "pooling"?A: Pooling issues are best answered on an individual basis. Call us at this number for additional answers to this issue: (405) 819-6170Q: Don't I need legal counsel before making such a decision?A: Legal counsel is generally indispensable, however, Attorneys tend to drag their feet, thereby causing their clients to miss valuable, time sensitive opportunities. We have seen this happen more times than not. Usually after waiting several weeks or months, we finally receive a phone call asking if the opportunity in question is still available. Sadly, 99 of the time, too much time has elapsed and the monies available back then are no longer appropriated. In this type case, the Attorney profits, not the mineral owner. However, leasing directly with Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer allows for the negotiation of terms that might otherwise not be possible.Q: What makes your company any better than the others doing the same thing?A: First and foremost because of our many years of experience.

Oil & Gas Mineral Rights Buyer, and Complete Land ServicesOklahoma Oil and Gas mineral rights royalty buyers are in the business of helping Land owners convert their oil & gas royalty income, into a one-time lump sum payment. Oil and Gas Lease Services also can help Land-owners convert their oil & gas mineral rights into a paid up lease, with a chance creating future royalty income. Oil and Gas mineral rights buyer is dedicated to treating our land owners, and our clients just as we would like to be treated: with honesty, integrity, respect, and our goal is to maximize benefit for all involved.   Call now (405) 819-6170   Leasing to another company allows for the negotiation of terms that would otherwise not be possible, and if you do not act quickly to address your options, the present options will no longer be present.Legal counsel is generally indispensable, however, attorneys tend to drag their feet, thereby causing their clients to miss valuable, time sensitive opportunities.I have seen this happen more times than I can count, only to receive a phone call several weeks or months later, asking if the offer or opportunity is still available. Sadly, 99% of the time, I have to tell them it is not.If a lease is to be negotiated in this case, then the terms would be competitive, relative to the options above, however, there are some unavoidable and pertinent questions that must be asked:Will your bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling, and be a consistent source of income. The answer to that question depends solely on the answers to the next 5.- If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time.- If a well is drilled.- If that well is not a dry hole.- If that well is operated in a prudent manner.- And, most importantly, IF oil, natural gas, and gas liquids prices will sustain continued production, and the risk of new exploration.These are questions that are often not asked, and not one, or any combination of these is guaranteed, and no one person or company has control of these variables.Here are some of the tax benefits of selling versus collecting royalty income:One of the things I hear more than any other is weighing the pros/cons regarding taxation when selling minerals vs. waiting on the royalty income. Selling is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates.Things to Consider:- For 2012, capital gains taxes have a 15% cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes.- Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20% Regardless of whether you are in the lowest income tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10%.- Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases, can more than double your tax liability.- Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.​Again, unleased, open mineral acreage is always worth more, and that is the current status of your acreage in Section 32. If you are asking yourself why it would be worth more to my company, then that is because my company would then pay it's proportionate share of the cost of a well, which is usually hundreds of thousands, if not millions to participate. You may be in a position to do the very same thing, but most are not.    call us today and find out what' we could  pay now for your rights     Mineral Rights and RoyaltiesWe can convert your mineral rights now into a lump sum Call (405) 819-6170Sell Your Oil and Gas Royalties and Mineral Rights:Oklahoma mineral rights and royalty Buyers are experts and will guide you through the often complex procedure of selling your royalties OIL AND GAS  Mineral Rights will evaluate your property ( Land ,Lease terms  ) in a friendly, professional manner .

Testimonial
 




Lew W, - Phoenix, AZ "Last month my wife and I decided to sell some of our oil/gas mineral rights. I found UNI Royalties on-line via a google search. I filled out the form on there website on the 15th on the 16th I received a phone call from Patrick. On the 17th I had a contract with UNI for $1,000 more than my best offer!!! With a few more phone calls, faxes and three FedEx deliveries I had a Cashiers Check on the 28th and this was all done over the Holiday Season. Thank you again Patrick and your staff for such professional and fast service."

Larry K. - Hondo, TX"I must say that during our negotiations UNI Royalties was always courteous, knowledgeable, and always prompt with responses when we would e-mail or call by phone. UNI closed our deal within 5 Business days after contracts were signed. The knowledge and performance are probably the chief reasons we sold the minerals to UNI Royalties as opposed to others we had been in contact with."
Daniel C. - Enid, OK "Even though UNI Royalties, Ltd. was unable to purchase or find an attainable offer for my mineral rights because it did not fit their model, their regard for me and my property was apparent. The information that was given to me during our phone conversations has been very helpful in determining the fate of my property. The professionals at Univest, Inc. are very attentive and ready for any question or concern."
William S. - Rockport, TX "I wanted to take a minute and thank you for expediting the sale of my Overriding Royalty via your organization. As you know, I had a need to sell my ORRI quickly after having a major surgery. Not only did your company meet my funding deadline, but you did it in a professional manner. Candidly, I found dealing with your company and partners "a breath of fresh air" and would readily do it again."
John B. - Limestone County, TX "My wife and I both decided to sell our producing minerals, I solicited 7 Companies and before I even heard a peep from the other 6; UNI Royalties had a Contract Offer in my lap for our property. 5 Days later we had a bank wire sent to our Bank Account. Univestors Offer beat the 3 companies that responded to the information I put across their websites. I must say that we were shocked how easy it was to do business with UNI Royalties. They were fast, efficient, and there integrity is impeccable and I trust the people working at UNI Royalties implicitly. Thanks again for the easy and smooth transaction, I hope we cross paths to do business again in the future."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
