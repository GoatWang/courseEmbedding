Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team
