CELEBRATING 45 YEARS OF RELIABILITY
Click the thumbnail images on the timeline to explore Duke Realty’s strong history of reliability and success.

1972



With $40,000 in capital and limited knowledge of commercial real estate, John Rosebrough, Phil Duke, and John Wynne embarked on their first industrial development in Park 100 on the northwest side of the city. Over the years, Duke Realty transformed Park 100 into one of the country’s largest industrial parks, eventually encompassing 1,500 acres.




1977



Once Duke Realty was well established in Indianapolis, company leaders decided to expand geographically and began development in Cincinnati. In addition to opening its first satellite office, Duke Realty expanded its development portfolio to include office buildings.




1985-1997



Over the next 20 years, Duke Realty’s presence in the Midwest grew. Offices were opened in Chicago, St. Louis, Nashville, Minneapolis and Columbus, Ohio, with Duke Realty becoming one of the largest developers and property owners in each of these markets.




1993



The company issued an IPO that generated more than $310 million and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: DRE). Funds generated by the IPO helped improve the company’s balance sheet and put it in an excellent position to raise capital in the future to grow its portfolio.




1999



With a strong business model in place, Duke Realty was ready to expand and acquired a company that was similar in terms of product types and business operations, but geographically diverse. The merger gave Duke Realty an entrance into new and fast-growing markets throughout the southeastern United States and a stronger national presence.




2006



Duke Realty was once again ready to expand geographically and identified strong markets where it wanted a presence. Properties in Houston expanded Duke Realty’s footprint in the West. The company also strengthened its position in the East with an acquisition in Washington D.C. and properties in Savannah, Baltimore and New Jersey near major seaports.




2011-2016



Duke Realty exited the suburban office sector of the business and repositioned its portfolio so that the majority of its net operating income was generated by its industrial portfolio. Duke Realty used proceeds from the sale of its office properties to fund new development and acquisitions of industrial properties and strengthen its balance sheet.




2013



Duke Realty expanded geographically to capitalize on industrial development opportunities near ports and population-dense areas of the country. Through acquisitions and new development, the company established a footprint in Southern California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.




2015-2017



As part of its growth strategy, Duke Realty continues to focus on the top-tier industrial markets in the United States. The company expanded its portfolios in both Northern and Southern California, as well as New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and South Florida, through the acquisition and development of high-quality, modern warehouse facilities.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
