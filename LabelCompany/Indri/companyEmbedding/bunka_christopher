				Who We Are                
			
		

Lexaria Corp. was founded by determined people who have always worked hard to build value both for shareholders and for customers. We have grown to become a revenue-generating biosciences company focused on proprietary technology for improved delivery of bioactive compounds including cannabinoids, through delicious foods. In 2014 we identified scientifically modulated hemp oil delivery as an area of wonderful potential for the Company and its shareholders. Today, we are actively developing and selling hemp oil-based gourmet food products through our subsidiary ViPova™ and under the Lexaria Energy brand. Our business focus has changed over the years but our dedication to customers and shareholders will never waver.
For those of you who have shared our journey over the years, and for new participants as well: thanks for being part of our story.
