History


For much of its first century, Genesee & Wyoming was a 14-mile railroad serving a single customer in upstate New York. The company has since grown to be a leading owner and operator of short line and regional freight railroads serving more than 2,000 customers over 15,000 miles of track in five countries.1899
The original 14-mile railroad is purchased out of bankruptcy by Edward L. Fuller and his financial partners to transport salt from their mine in Western New York State. The mine in Retsof, N.Y., would become the largest producing rock salt mine in the world, and the company became the International Salt Corporation. The railroad, renamed the Genesee and Wyoming Railroad Company (GNWR), continues as a separate, independent business.1977
Mortimer B. Fuller III, great grandson of Edward L. Fuller, purchases a controlling interest in GWRR – still a 14-mile railroad serving principally one customer.A holding company, Genesee & Wyoming Industries, is formed and the GWRR merged into it to facilitate diversification of the business. The company enters the rail car leasing and management business primarily focused on covered hoppers to serve the salt industry.1980
The Staggers Act deregulates railroads, which are then allowed to dispose of routes that they could not operate profitably, helping to restore their financial health. Locally, Fuller works with NYDOT, the B&O and D&H in the restructuring of Conrail and the rail system serving International Salt, then the largest rail shipper in New York State. He learns the contribution that small railroads can make to improving rail system efficiency at a time when the industry is struggling and constrained by lack of capital for investment.1985 – 1996During post-Staggers Act restructuring, G&W’s acquisitions are 100% domestic, including the 1996 purchase of Rail Link, today a leading provider of industrial switching and port rail services. Now focused on short line and regional freight railroads, the company changes its name to Genesee & Wyoming Inc. and goes public in June of 1996.Acquisitions during this period include:1985: Dansville & Mount Morris Railroad1986: Rochester & Southern Railroad1987: Louisiana & Delta Railroad1988: Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad1992: Allegheny & Eastern Railroad,          Bradford Industrial Rail1993: Willamette & Pacific Railroad1995: Portland & Western Railroad1996: Illinois & Midland Railroad,          Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad,          Rail Link, Inc.1997 – 2000As bidding competition increases for U.S. railroads, G&W’s acquisition focus is 100% international as other countries privatize and restructure their rail industries:1997: G&W privatizes Australia National's South Australia business          Huron Central Railway,          Quebec Gatineau Railway,          Australia Southern Railroad2000: Australian Railroad Group (ARG) formed with 50% joint-venture          partner Wesfarmers Ltd2001 – 2005G&W’s acquisition focus returns to domestic opportunities in a period of decreased bidding competition:2001: South Buffalo Railway2002: Emons Industries Inc. [St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad,          St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad (Quebec), York Railway],          Utah Railway2003: Georgia Pacific Railroads [Chattahoochee Industrial Railroad,          Arkansas Louisiana and Mississippi Railroad, Fordyce and          Princeton Railroad]2004: Tazewell & Peoria Railroad,          Golden Isles Terminal Wharf2005: First Coast Railroad          Rail Management Corporation [AN Railway, Atlantic & Western Railway,          The Bay Line Railroad, East Tennessee Railway,          Georgia Central Railway, KWT Railway,          Little Rock & Western Railway, Meridian & Bigbee Railroad,          Riceboro Southern Railway, Tomahawk Railway,          Valdosta Railway, Western Kentucky Railway]2006 – presentFollowing the “Rail Renaissance”, G&W continues to pursue organic growth opportunities as well as both domestic and international acquisitions:2006: Sale of ARG by G&W and Wesfarmers. Genesee & Wyoming Australia created when G&W purchases Wesfarmers' 50% ownership of certain South Australian operations of ARG.          Chattahoochee Bay Railroad2007: Maryland Midland Railway2008: Rotterdam Rail Feeding,          CAGY Industries [Columbus & Greenville Railway,          Chattooga & Chickamauga Railway,          Luxapalila Valley Railroad],          Ohio Central Railroad System [Ohio Central Railroad,          Columbus & Ohio River Railroad, Mahoning Valley Railway,          Ohio & Pennsylvania Railroad, Warren & Trumbull Railroad,          Youngstown & Austintown Railroad, Youngstown Belt Railroad,          Pittsburgh & Ohio Central Railroad, Aliquippa & Ohio River Railroad],          Georgia Southwestern Railroad2009: The Willamette & Pacific becomes the first G&W railroad to receive the E.H. Harriman Gold Award for the best safety performance of any U.S. railroad working between 250,000 and four million man-hours. The Willamette & Pacific also received two President's Awards from the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) -- only the second time a railroad has ever won two President's Awards -- for best safety performance and most injury-free man-hours in 2008.2010: The Buffalo & Pittsburgh receives the E.H. Harriman Gold Award for best safety performance of any U.S. railroad between 250,000 and four million man-hours, as well as two ASLRRA President's Awards for best safety performance and most injury-free man-hours.

Find CompaniesGenesee & Wyoming Inc.12 reviewsAbout12ReviewsSalariesPhotos88Jobs13Q&AAbout Genesee & Wyoming Inc.Genesee & Wyoming (GWI) once relied on the salt of the earth -- hauling salt on a 14-mile railroad for one customer. Now, however, the company owns stakes in more than 65 short-line and regional freight railroads that operate over a total of about 9,000 miles of track, including about 7,600 miles of track owned and leased by the company and another – more... 1,400 miles belonging to other railroads and service to 17 ports in North America and Europe. Freight transported by GWI railroads includes coal, forest products, and pulp and paper. Outside North America, the company has operations in Australia and the Netherlands. In late 2012 it acquired rival  RailAmerica for almost $1.4 billion.Besides its railroad operations, GWI provides freight car switching and related services for industrial companies that own railroad facilities.GWI's average freight revenues per carload increased nearly 8% in 2010 when compared to the previous year. Although revenues from the transportation of coal and coke, which accounts for nearly 20% of GWI's freight revenues, was relatively flat, shipments of farm and food products improved by about 50%. The company is also looking to expand its intermodal operations. (Intermodal involves the shipment of freight in a container using multiple modes of transportation.) Intermodal revenues jumped from $411,000 in 2009 to $ 7.8 million in 2010.The company, which has expanded over the years via acquisitions (about 35 between 1985 and 2010), hopes to continue to grow by buying railroads, not only in North America and Australia but also in European markets. Its $1.4 billion milestone deal to purchase RailAmerica created the largest short-line railroad operator in the US, with about 110 railroads and 15,100 miles of track. The transaction is expected to more than triple GWI's debt, but it hopes the newly integrated entity's increased cash flow will allow it to quickly recover.In addition to that significant deal, GWI expects freight business in Australia to pick up as the grain harvest in that country increased over the previous year's totals. To that end, GWI purchased Australia's FreightLink rail network for about $332 million Australian dollars ($319 million). FreightLink, which serves general freight and mining customers in South Australia, will operate as part of Genesee & Wyoming Australia (GWA). GWA has managed FreightLink's rail services and operations and provided it with locomotives and crews since its inception.Chairman Mortimer Fuller, great-grandson of founder Edward L. Fuller, owns a 28% stake in the company. – lessReviewsOverall2.1Based on 12 reviews5 stars4 stars3 stars2 stars1 starWork/Life Balance2.4Compensation/Benefits2.6Job Security/Advancement2.4Management2.1Culture2.1Featured ReviewTrack Laborer of CF&E RailroadTrack Laborer of CF&E Railroad, Fort Wayne, IN - April 28, 2017Maintainance of Way Department is like signing up to be a slave.

Genesee & Wyoming Inc. is an American short-line railroad holding company that owns or maintains interests in 120 railroads throughout five countries (the United States, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Netherlands and the United Kingdom), and operates more than 15,500 miles (24,900 km) of owned and leased track, with more than 3,300 miles (5,300 km) under additional track-access arrangements.[2] The company had its roots in the Class III Genesee and Wyoming Railroad, which began in 1899.[3]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
Genesee and Wyoming Railroad, predecessor of Genesee & Wyoming Inc., was purchased out of bankruptcy in 1899 by Edward L. Fuller. At that time, the railroad was operating as a 14.5 miles (23.3 km) long single-track line serving a single customer, a salt mine owned by Fuller in Retsof, NY. It was still operating the same line for the salt mine when Mortimer B. Fuller III, great grandson of Edward L. Fuller, purchased the railroad in 1977. The holding company, Genesee & Wyoming Railroad Inc., was organized during the same year, and the railroad became its subsidiary.[3]
With deregulation of the rail industry by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, railroads began disposing of unprofitable routes. Genesee & Wyoming acquired several of these short line railroads, scattered across the United States, from 1985 to 1996. Its acquisitions began including railroads in other countries in 1997.[3]
Continued expansion[edit]
In November 1997 Genesee & Wyoming purchased the South Australian freight operations of Australian National and rebranded the operation Australian Southern Railroad.[4]
In October 2000 Australian Railroad Group, a 50/50 joint venture between Genesee & Wyoming and Wesfarmers, were the successful bidder for the Westrail freight business in Western Australia.[5][6] As part of the joint venture agreement, ownership of Australian Southern Railroad passed to Australian Railroad Group.
In July 2003, the Carolina Coastal Railway, operated by G&W subsidiary Rail Link, Inc., was sold to Main Line Rail Management, Inc.
On May 26, 2005, G&W announced that it has agreed to purchase the railroad operations of Rail Management Corporation (RMC). G&W paid $243 million in cash and assume $1.7 million in company debt to gain control of 14 short line railroads from RMC across the southeastern United States, as of June 1, 2005.[7][8]
As of the close of 2005, Genesee and Wyoming had 2,330 employees in North America. That year, Hurricane Stan wiped out several miles of Genesee & Wyoming track in Mexico. In 2006, the Mexican government agreed to pay 75 percent of the rebuilding costs, or $15 million, to reconstruct the track.
In June 2006 the Australian Railroad Group joint venture was broken up with the Western Australian above rail operation sold to QR National and the below rail infrastructure to Babcock & Brown in a $974 million (A$1.55 billion) deal. At the same time Wesfarmers sold its 50% share in the South Australian operation back to Genesee & Wyoming Inc for $15 million (A$22 million).[9] The operation was rebranded Genesee & Wyoming Australia.[10]
Also in 2006, Genesee & Wyoming elected to write off most of the value of its Bolivian operation, on fears that the Bolivian government would soon nationalize privately held railroads there.[11] Genesee & Wyoming remains an investor in Empresa Ferroviaria Oriental, S.A.[12]
In June 2010 Genesee & Wyoming, through a subsidiary holding company, paid A$334 million to acquire the operational rights to and the leasehold of the Tarcoola to Darwin Railway from the Asia Pacific Transport Consortium, and the operational rolling stock of FreightLink.[13][14] This 1,400 miles (2,300 km) rail line was the longest the company has leased.[3]
On 2 August 2011, Genesee & Wyoming announced that it planned to purchase the Arizona Eastern Railway from Iowa Pacific Holdings for US$90.1 million, with the deal expected to be completed by the end of the year.[15] The deal was closed on 1 September 2011.[16]
On July 23, 2012, Genesee & Wyoming agreed to purchase RailAmerica Inc. (RA), the short-line railroad holding company controlled by Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), for $1.39 billion to combine North America’s two largest short-line and regional rail operators.[17][18][19]
On February 24, 2015, Genesee & Wyoming announced that it has agreed to acquire approximately 95% of the shares of Freightliner Group Limited.[20]
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming announced that intended to acquire the Providence & Worcester Railroad, which operates in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, for $126 million.[21] The deal was approved by Providence & Worcester shareholders in October, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition in December.[22]
On February 7, 2017, Genesee & Wyoming announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase the Heart of Georgia Railroad, subject to regulatory approval.[23]
Subsidiaries and holdings[edit]
See also: List of railroads owned by Genesee & Wyoming
Genesee & Wyoming Inc. owns controlling interests in 122 freight railroads, either directly or through subsidiaries, which are organized into 11 operating regions.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
Genesee and Wyoming Railroad, predecessor of Genesee & Wyoming Inc., was purchased out of bankruptcy in 1899 by Edward L. Fuller. At that time, the railroad was operating as a 14.5 miles (23.3 km) long single-track line serving a single customer, a salt mine owned by Fuller in Retsof, NY. It was still operating the same line for the salt mine when Mortimer B. Fuller III, great grandson of Edward L. Fuller, purchased the railroad in 1977. The holding company, Genesee & Wyoming Railroad Inc., was organized during the same year, and the railroad became its subsidiary.[3]
With deregulation of the rail industry by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, railroads began disposing of unprofitable routes. Genesee & Wyoming acquired several of these short line railroads, scattered across the United States, from 1985 to 1996. Its acquisitions began including railroads in other countries in 1997.[3]
Continued expansion[edit]
In November 1997 Genesee & Wyoming purchased the South Australian freight operations of Australian National and rebranded the operation Australian Southern Railroad.[4]
In October 2000 Australian Railroad Group, a 50/50 joint venture between Genesee & Wyoming and Wesfarmers, were the successful bidder for the Westrail freight business in Western Australia.[5][6] As part of the joint venture agreement, ownership of Australian Southern Railroad passed to Australian Railroad Group.
In July 2003, the Carolina Coastal Railway, operated by G&W subsidiary Rail Link, Inc., was sold to Main Line Rail Management, Inc.
On May 26, 2005, G&W announced that it has agreed to purchase the railroad operations of Rail Management Corporation (RMC). G&W paid $243 million in cash and assume $1.7 million in company debt to gain control of 14 short line railroads from RMC across the southeastern United States, as of June 1, 2005.[7][8]
As of the close of 2005, Genesee and Wyoming had 2,330 employees in North America. That year, Hurricane Stan wiped out several miles of Genesee & Wyoming track in Mexico. In 2006, the Mexican government agreed to pay 75 percent of the rebuilding costs, or $15 million, to reconstruct the track.
In June 2006 the Australian Railroad Group joint venture was broken up with the Western Australian above rail operation sold to QR National and the below rail infrastructure to Babcock & Brown in a $974 million (A$1.55 billion) deal. At the same time Wesfarmers sold its 50% share in the South Australian operation back to Genesee & Wyoming Inc for $15 million (A$22 million).[9] The operation was rebranded Genesee & Wyoming Australia.[10]
Also in 2006, Genesee & Wyoming elected to write off most of the value of its Bolivian operation, on fears that the Bolivian government would soon nationalize privately held railroads there.[11] Genesee & Wyoming remains an investor in Empresa Ferroviaria Oriental, S.A.[12]
In June 2010 Genesee & Wyoming, through a subsidiary holding company, paid A$334 million to acquire the operational rights to and the leasehold of the Tarcoola to Darwin Railway from the Asia Pacific Transport Consortium, and the operational rolling stock of FreightLink.[13][14] This 1,400 miles (2,300 km) rail line was the longest the company has leased.[3]
On 2 August 2011, Genesee & Wyoming announced that it planned to purchase the Arizona Eastern Railway from Iowa Pacific Holdings for US$90.1 million, with the deal expected to be completed by the end of the year.[15] The deal was closed on 1 September 2011.[16]
On July 23, 2012, Genesee & Wyoming agreed to purchase RailAmerica Inc. (RA), the short-line railroad holding company controlled by Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), for $1.39 billion to combine North America’s two largest short-line and regional rail operators.[17][18][19]
On February 24, 2015, Genesee & Wyoming announced that it has agreed to acquire approximately 95% of the shares of Freightliner Group Limited.[20]
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming announced that intended to acquire the Providence & Worcester Railroad, which operates in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, for $126 million.[21] The deal was approved by Providence & Worcester shareholders in October, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition in December.[22]
On February 7, 2017, Genesee & Wyoming announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase the Heart of Georgia Railroad, subject to regulatory approval.[23]
Subsidiaries and holdings[edit]
See also: List of railroads owned by Genesee & Wyoming
Genesee & Wyoming Inc. owns controlling interests in 122 freight railroads, either directly or through subsidiaries, which are organized into 11 operating regions. These subsidiaries include Rail Link, Inc. (1996), Genesee & Wyoming Canada, Inc. (1997), Emons Railroad Group (2002), CAGY Industries (2008), and Summit View, Inc. (2008). In 2005 G&W acquired the properties formerly owned by the Rail Management Corporation.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score

Value Score

Momentum Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
