The Opportunity
Many of the best opportunities for success in the cannabis industry are in emerging markets. Getting established early in a newly regulated state could enable you to become a dominant player in your region. If you attempt to enter a market later in the licensing process, the prospects for your business may diminish significantly.
At AmeriCann, we can help you identify the most promising markets and help you navigate and obtain a valuable license. Additionally, we can provide a comprehensive set of services and the capital to help you succeed once you obtain a license.
What is the Preferred Partner Program?
AmeriCann, Inc. develops, owns and supports advanced medical cannabis facilities in multiple states. In an effort to advance the quality of medical cannabis and to promote greater access for patients, AmeriCann has initiated the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program. We support local businesses that seek to serve cannabis patients in their communities.
AmeriCann does not cultivate, process, distribute or sell cannabis. Rather, we assist local partners to obtain licenses, to cultivate medicine and to provide important medicine to patients. The company provides an essential set of resources including advanced cultivation facilities, access to a team of experts and, in certain cases, working capital for our partners’ businesses. If you would like to learn more about the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program or apply for the program, please download the Fact Sheet and complete the Preferred Partner Program Questionnaire.

Illinois
AmeriCann partnered with Wellness Group Pharms prior to the submittal of WGP’s application in Illinois.

Sustainable real estate development for medical cannabis

Denver, Colorado

United States


americann.co 



About AmeriCann, Inc.
AmeriCann, based in Denver, Colorado, is a publicly traded company with the stock symbol “ACAN.” The company develops and leases technologically advanced medical cannabis properties to local, licensed partners in regulated markets. The Company does not cultivate, process, distribute or sell cannabis.
The company’s proprietary energy efficient greenhouse cannabis cultivation and processing design is known as Cannopy. This produces more consistent, quality medicine with a fraction of the energy and other resources required of traditional indoor warehouse, facilities.
The need for the real estate to support the rapidly growing medical cannabis industry is substantial. The company has over 1,0000,000 square feet of resource efficient properties in various stages of development in multiple states.
We have always sought to set new standards for our industry and becoming a B Corp validates these efforts. B Corp certification provides a benchmark for us to assess how well we serve patients, our communities, our workers and the environment. This confirms what we have accomplished to date, but more importantly delivers an invaluable tool for us to become the best company possible for the future.

The Change We Seek®
AmeriCann has the opportunity to make a significant impact on the fastest growing industry in the country. Medical cannabis is in its formative stages and few companies anywhere have the potential to have such a positive impact.










What makes us a better company?

Americann, Inc. (OTCQX: ACAN) is engaged as a medical cannabis cultivation and processing company. Shares of the cannabis company are rallying 17.16%, through afternoon trading on Wednesday, July 19, 2017. Over the past month, Americann, Inc. has seen average daily volume of 18,824 shares. However volume of 33,537 shares or dollar volume of $80,153, has already exchanged hands on Wednesday.
Shares of Americann, Inc. are rallying today, after Massachusetts House and Senate Conference Committee have approved a new adult-use of cannabis within the state. Now the company is preparing to open a cultivation facility in Massachusetts, as the market is expected to eventually reach $1.8 billion in the state. Here is the full press release detailing of the Massachusetts cannabis laws:
Americann, Inc. Press Release:
DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2017 / Americann, Inc. (OTCQX: ACAN), an Agricultural-Technology company that is developing the next generation of sustainable, state-of-the-art medical cannabis cultivation properties, announced today that the Massachusetts House and Senate Conference Committee have approved a safe and responsible regulatory structure for adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts. The legislature has taken a thoughtful approach to the implementation of this law.
In November of 2016, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot measure that makes it the first state in the eastern U.S. to legalize the adult use of marijuana. The Commonwealth has an existing medical marijuana program that was approved in 2012 with only 12 vertically-integrated operators growing and selling medical cannabis. According to industry experts, the combined market for both the medical and new adult program could exceed $1.8 billion annually at maturity.
Company CEO Tim Keogh stated, “The legalization of cannabis for all adults in Massachusetts significantly expands the need for the infrastructure to serve both patients and consumers. With nearly 1,000,000 square feet approved for development, AmeriCann can provide the type of sustainable, efficient, consistent and reliable cultivation facilities that are essential to serve the citizens of Massachusetts. We view the progress of the bill as a very positive development for our MMCC project in Freetown.”
In addition to AmeriCann’s involvement with the Massachusetts cannabis industry the team has first-hand experience with Colorado’s adult-use program and understands the importance of establishing rules and regulations that are effective and reasonable. AmeriCann’s staff and advisors have been working directly with the Legislature over the last 7 months to establish a regulatory structure that works for the citizens of Massachusetts. Massachusetts has the opportunity to become a model for other states that are considering or choose to adopt regulation over prohibition.
The bill now moves back to the House and the Senate for a vote, up or down but with no amendments, and if approved moves to the Governor’s desk for signature.
Besides Massachusetts, California, Maine, and Nevada also voted to legalize Adult Use marijuana in November 2016. Nevada is the only state that has set a regulatory structure and commenced sales. In the first weekend of Adult Use sales in Nevada, earlier this month over $500,000 in tax revenue was generated for the State and dispensaries were experiencing long lines and shortages of products for the 47 dispensaries that were open.
Americann’s flagship project, the Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center (“MMCC”), is 47 miles from Boston in the midst of the rapidly growing Massachusetts medical cannabis market. The MMCC project is approved for 1 million square feet, which will be developed in phases and is expected to be one of the most technologically advanced cultivation facilities in the nation.
About Americann, Inc.

The first phase of the project consists of 160,000 sq. ft. of cultivation and processing infrastructure. AmeriCann can expand the first phase to approximately 600,000 sq. ft., based on patient demand.

The products are designed to allow consumers to manage dosage through micro-dosing and to improve efficacy by incorporating blends of other plants, essential oils and other supplements that enhance and compliment the benefits of cannabis.   Consumers seek quality, consistency and value for all products.  The need for Solanna as a brand that instills confidence and reliability for consumers is even more important for the emerging cannabis industry.   As more patients and consumers are introduced to cannabis for the first time, the availability of a trusted brand is particularly important.   “The introduction of a proprietary brand of cannabis products is the perfect complement to our business model – which is to provide state-of-the-art cannabis cultivation and processing facilities throughout the country”, said Tim Keogh, CEO of AmeriCann, Inc.

AmeriCann has created the brand, packaging concepts and invested significantly in Standard Operating Procedures and Good Manufacturing Practices to ensure safety, consistency and efficacy across the product offering.

                                                                                                                    AmeriCann, Incorporated   3200 Brighton Blvd. Unit 114 Denver, CO 80216 www.americann.co   	  	   WORLD-CLASS FACILITIES FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS We have a multi-market growth strategy with a current portfolio of over 1,000,000 sq. ft. of sustainable cannabis production infrastructure in development. We are a reporting, publicly listed company with the US stock symbol: ACAN on the OTCQX marketplace.         AmeriCann, Inc. develops, owns and supports advanced medical cannabis cultivation and processing facilities nationwide. The Company has a multi-market portfolio of over 1,000,000 square feet of sustainable cannabis production infrastructure in various stages of development.   http://americann.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AmeriCann-MMCC-4.7.16.pdf    AmeriCann's team includes experts in traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, medical research, facility construction, regulatory compliance, security, marijuana cultivation and genetics, extraction processes, and infused product development. To support local businesses that seek to serve cannabis patients in their communities we initiated the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program. Through this program we provide an essential set of resources including advance cultivation facilities, access to a team of experts and in certain cases, capital for our partner's businesses. In addition, AmeriCann's team has been instrumental in winning cannabis licenses in competitive application processes throughout the country. This support is designed to assist our Preferred Partners in newly regulated markets.  AmeriCann leases facilities to our Preferred Partners that are designed with AmeriCann's propriety cultivation and processing system called "Cannopy." AmeriCann developed Cannopy with experts from traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, regulatory compliance and cannabis cultivation. Cannopy includes automation throughout the production life-cycle, customized workflow processes, monitoring and controls, and top-line security systems. Cannopy empowers Preferred Partners to consistently produce medical marijuana for patients at the lowest cost in the most efficient, compliant manner. We provide initial and on-going training, policies, practices and procedures to operate the state-of-the-art facilities.  The expanding cannabis industry requires extensive real estate to meet the growing needs of patients. AmeriCann utilizes a proven strategy for identifying, acquiring and developing real estate specifically suited for cannabis operations. AmeriCann assists our Preferred Partners with the identification, design, permitting, acquisition, development and operation of scalable infrastructure to cultivate and to dispense medical marijuana in regulated markets.  As an early market participant, the Company plans to leverage its leadership in a formative industry to establish a dominant position as the cannabis industry expands.

Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center  Previously the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a 52.6 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The property is located approximately 47 miles southeast of Boston. The Company plans to develop the property as the Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center "MMCC". Plans for the MMCC may include the construction of sustainable greenhouse cultivation, processing, and infused product facilities that will be leased or sold to Registered Marijuana Dispensaries under the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Program. The Company paid the seller $100,000 upon the signing of the agreement which amount will be applied toward the purchase price of $4,000,000 at the closing. Pursuant to the original agreement the closing was to take place on or before June 1, 2015. On May 6, 2015, to address site considerations before finalizing the planned development, the agreement was amended to extend the closing date to September 1, 2015. On August 27, 2015, after addressing the site considerations, the agreement was amended to extend the closing date to October 30, 2015 to provide additional time for permitting. In connection with this amendment, the Company paid the seller an additional $100,000. On October 23, 2015, the Company made an additional payment of $100,000 to extend the closing date to December 29, 2015. All payments made by the Company to the seller ($300,000) will be applied to the purchase price. On November 6th, 2015 the Company filed a Site Plan Application to the Town of Freetown Planning Department. The Planning Board will review the MMCC project on November 24th, 2015.

He has extensive experience in the public and private capital markets, and has been instrumental in raising of over $800 million in equity and debt financing for emerging companies over the past decade. He earned an MBA in finance from UCLA.    	  TIM KEOGH, PRESIDENT, CEO Mr. Keogh offers a unique combination of firsthand experience in the cannabis industry, from licensing to operations in numerous states, and an extensive background in real estate development. He is a director of one of fifteen Provisionally Registered marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts, a board member of the Cannabis Producers Association of New England, and an active member and invited speaker for the National Cannabis Industry Association. He received a BS in business administration from Mount St. Mary’s College.     	  AMERICANN LEADERSHIP TEAM AmeriCann’s management team has a track record of success with both private and public companies includes an unprecedented level of industry experience and depth.      	  ERIC FORINGTON, GENETICS & BREEDING ADVISOR Mr. Forington is the Head of Breeding and Strain Development for 303 Seeds, a cannabis genetics and seed company based in Denver, Colorado.

Getting established early in a newly regulated state could enable you to become a dominant player in your region. If you attempt to enter a market later in the licensing process, the prospects for your business may diminish significantly. At AmeriCann, we can help you identify the most promising markets and help you navigate and obtain a valuable license. Additionally, we can provide a comprehensive set of services and the capital to help you succeed once you obtain a license.    	  WHAT IS THE PREFERRED PARTNER PROGRAM? AmeriCann, Inc. develops, owns and supports advanced medical cannabis facilities in multiple states. In an effort to advance the quality of medical cannabis and to promote greater access for patients, AmeriCann has initiated the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program. We support local businesses that seek to serve cannabis patients in their communities. AmeriCann does not cultivate, process, distribute or sell cannabis.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
