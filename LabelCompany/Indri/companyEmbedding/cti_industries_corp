CTI Industries stock price history provides insight into historical stock price fluctuations, and CTI Industries stock comparison chart enables peer comparison.  Some of the key terms used in the statement of cash flows are: Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents: CTI Industries cash reduced QoQ to $0.04M, meaning the company is unable to meet its expenditure and grow cash which will also eventually reflect in the  CTI Industries stock price movement.   Cash Flow from operating activities: This is the cash that the company receives from ongoing operations.  CTI Industries gained $3.52M cash from operations.  It is important to check this to see where the company is getting its money from.   Growth companies (typically most tech companies) spend heavily  on investing activities and this figure was negative at $-0.21M for CTIB stock.

Materials
This stage involves gathering all the necessary materials needed to make your product. Some factories provide materials and assembly; sometimes you will need to buy materials separately.








Production
"Production run" means making a lot of one product at once. The factories listed under "production" can produce small and/or large quantities. The minimum order for a production run can vary from factory to factory (some have no minimum, some require a dozen, and some require up to 1,000 to be made at once)

The Making Process
























Ideation
If you have a general idea of what you want to make, these factories will help refine your idea and think through the different components that involve the making of your idea. 

Pattern-Making
A pattern-maker is someone who makes a blueprint of your idea. They make sure your design will be well-constructed. 

Materials
This stage involves gathering all the necessary materials needed to make your product. Some factories provide materials and assembly; sometimes you will need to buy materials separately. 

Sample-Making
A sample is a prototype of your idea. Sample-makers usually make the product by hand (hand-cutting, hand-assembling, etc.) before you get your tooling finalized. You want your sample to be perfect if you plan to do mass production of your product.(Usually sample-makers charge more per product, but this depends on the factory’s policy.) 

Tooling
To produce products at a rapid rate and drive your cost down, you might have to invest in machinery that is customized to your design; that is "tooling". This machinery will vary depending on the product, but can range from plastic molds to custom branding stamps, and so on. 

Production
"Production run" means making a lot of one product at once. The factories listed under "production" can produce small and/or large quantities. The minimum order for a production run can vary from factory to factory (some have no minimum, some require a dozen, and some require up to 1,000 to be made at once)
