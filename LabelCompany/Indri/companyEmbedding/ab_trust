Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

What is an AB living trust and how does it work?









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Living Trust&rtrif;What is an AB living trust and how does it work? 













        What is an AB living trust and how does it work?      
With an AB living trust (sometimes called an "exemption" or "bypass" trust), the property contributed to the trust by the first grantor to die will be distributed to his or her beneficiaries when the surviving grantor dies. The surviving grantor cannot change the beneficiaries of the deceased grantor's trust property.
Imagine that a husband and wife create a typical joint trust and the husband passes away. Under the LegalZoom Joint Living Trust (and many other joint trusts), some or all of the husband's share can be held in trust for the wife during her lifetime. During her lifetime, she can change who will receive that trust property after her death. This may be exactly what the husband wanted. On the other hand, the husband's wishes may have been, "I want my wife to be able to use my share as long as she lives. But after she dies, I want to make sure that whatever is left goes to my beneficiaries instead of to people she chooses after I'm gone." If you want to make sure that each person's property goes to his or her separate beneficiaries, an AB trust may be a better choice than a joint trust or a simple will, regardless of the size of your estate.
Some married couples prefer an AB living trust over a traditional joint trust because of its flexibility and the tax benefits it offers. For many years, the AB living trust has allowed couples to avoid certain estate taxes. However, with the recent revisions to the federal estate tax law, only a very small percentage of people will owe estate tax on death. Under current law, $5 million of a person

Comparing Living Trusts and Last Wills
Although living trusts and last wills are both used to distribute property to beneficiaries, there are some important differences between them.

Probate is a court-supervised process used to validate your will and distribute your property. The process takes anywhere from six months to over two years to complete, and may require that lawyers or other professionals be hired. Even if you die without a will, if your estate's value exceeds a...

Transferring Property into a Living Trust

 Living Trust
Over the past twenty-five years, how to avoid probate has been the subject of countless speeches, books and seminars. The cost and the time delays of probate and the court system has led many people, including attorneys, to look for alternatives. One of the most popular alternatives is the living trust. It’s an effective method to avoid going to court not only after death, but also during life, in the event a person becomes incapacitated.

Product Description

You can use an AB Revocable Living Trust to provide for the transfer of your assets to your spouse and other named beneficiaries after you die in a manner that avoids probate and reduces estate tax. You can also use it to provide for the management of property left to young beneficiaries. This AB Revocable Living Trust is for a married couple with combined assets likely to be worth more than the current federal estate tax exemption threshold. This Revocable Living Trust allows a husband and wife (or registered domestic partners) to transfer assets into the trust and to each stipulate how their assets are to be divided following their deaths. In many cases, one spouse (or partner) will leave their entire estate to the other spouse partly to allow the survivor to have the benefit of their assets and partly because the transfer is tax-free. However, if as a result of this transfer, the value of the surviving spouse’s estate ultimately ends up exceeding the unified estate tax credit at the time of his or her death, then estate tax will be payable on the excess. This charge to tax, or rather part of it, can be avoided by using an AB Trust. This AB Revocable Living Trust is a downloadable form. It comes complete with guidance instructions on how to fill in the form as well as a variety of sample clauses including UTMA custodianship and child trust provisions.

Do You Still Need Your AB Trust?




These days, very few families need a complicated tax-avoidance trust.


By Mary Randolph, J.D.

Share on Facebook


















Because of changes to state and federal laws in the last few
years, most couples no longer need to worry about federal estate tax. But what
if you set up a tax-avoidance trust years ago? You may want to act now to get
rid of it, and avoid unnecessary expense and hassle for your family.
Law Changes that Make AB Trusts Less Desirable
Several big developments in the law have made AB trusts—the most
common kind of tax-avoidance trust—much less desirable or needed.
Increased exemptions
for federal estate tax. The amount that is exempt from federal estate tax
has increased enormously. For deaths in 2016, each person can give away or
leave $5.45 million without owing tax. This exemption amount rises each year to adjust for inflation. As a result, fewer than one half of one
percent of estates will owe federal estate tax. So
unless your family is one of the richest in the country, you don’t need to
worry about federal estate tax.
Big tax breaks
for married couples. Wealthy married couples can combine the federal estate
tax exemption of each spouse, giving the couple a total exemption of   $10.9 million for deaths in 2016.
Repeal of state
estate taxes. Several states have abolished their own estate taxes. Of the states that impose them, some exempt as much property as does the
federal government, but some exempt less.   State estate tax rates are generally much lower than the federal ones, and it may not be worth it to create an AB trust just to avoid state estate taxes.
Marriage equality
rulings. Same-sex couples now get the same federal tax breaks as other
married couples. After a U.S. Supreme Court ruling invalidating parts of the
federal Defense of Marriage Act, the IRS announced that it would treat all
legally married couples the same for tax purposes, whether or not a couple
lives in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage.
Why Not to Leave an AB Trust in Place
If you created an AB trust a few years back, when the estate
tax exemption was much lower and many more people paid the tax, you may think
that there’s no harm in keeping the trust. After all, it will ensure that your
assets avoid probate, and if there’s no estate tax to pay, so much the better,
right? But the truth is that an AB trust has some significant costs—and if you
don’t need to avoid taxes, they probably aren’t worth it.
A refresher, if it’s been a while since you’ve thought about
how these trusts work: When one spouse dies, the trust is split into two
trusts, Trust A and Trust B. One is irrevocable; the surviving spouse can’t
change its terms. 
Restrictions on the surviving spouse's use of the
property.  Probably the most important drawback of an AB trust is that
the surviving spouse has only limited rights to use the assets that are in the
irrevocable trust. Typically, the survivor gets only the income generated by
the trust assets.
Cost.  When one spouse dies, the survivor must
hire a lawyer or accountant to determine how to best divide the couple's assets
between the irrevocable trust and the surviving spouse's revocable living
trust. This decision can have important tax consequences.
Trust tax returns.  The irrevocable trust is a
separate, tax-paying entity. The surviving spouse must get a taxpayer ID number
for it and file an annual trust income tax return.
Recordkeeping.  The surviving spouse must keep
separate records for the irrevocable trust property.
How to Revoke an AB Trust
As long as both spouses are alive, you can revoke your trust
and avoid the expense and hassle that will come after one spouse dies. To do it
right, follow these essential steps:

Transfer all of the trust assets out of the
trust and back into your names. This entails reversing all the work you did to “fund”
the trust, when you transferred everything into your names as trustees. For
example, if you wanted to hold your house in the trust, you executed a new
deed, transferring the real estate from you and your spouse to you and your
spouse in your capacity as trustees of
your trust. Now you need to reverse that, and create and record another
deed transferring the house back into your names as individuals, not trustees. 
Create and sign a simple document revoking the
trust.
Let people know that you’ve revoked the trust.
If you’ve notified a lawyer, bank, financial adviser or anyone else that you
created an AB trust, now tell them that you’ve revoked it. This will help avoid
confusion after your death.

What You May Want Instead
For most families, a simple probate-avoidance trust is
better than the much more complex AB trust.  A simple revocable trust is, basically, a substitute for a will. It isn’t
designed to continue past the death of a spouse; instead, the trust assets are
quickly distributed to the people who inherit them. No probate court
proceedings are necessary after the death, which saves money and hassle. And because the trust doesn’t
stay in existence for years, no trust tax returns are necessary.
Most people can make a revocable living trust themselves,
without hiring a lawyer to draft the paperwork. But even if you do
hire a lawyer to create the trust or to review your work, the cost will be
significantly less than you’ll pay either to create an AB trust or to
administer it after a spouse dies.

Living Trusts















Avoiding probate court proceedings after your death can save your family time, money, and headaches. Revocable living trusts are the only probate-avoidance technique that allows you to avoid probate for virtually any property you own: real estate, jewelry, heirlooms, bank accounts, and much more.
Revocable living trusts function like wills--you use them to leave your property, and if you change your mind at any time while you're alive, you can change the terms of the trust or revoke it altogether. The advantage comes at your death. Property in the trust is controlled by the person you named to take over as successor trustee, and that person has the power to distribute the property to inheritors without any probate court involvement. That saves everyone a lot of work and gets property to the people you chose to inherit it much more quickly.








Avoiding Probate With a Living Trust





Living Trust FAQ
An introduction to living trusts -- a popular way to avoid probate.




Probate FAQ
You've heard that you should avoid probate -- but why? Here are the basics.




How Living Trusts Avoid Probate
It's about as easy to prepare a living trust as it is to write a will. But property left through a will generally goes through probate, causing survivors delay and expense. (Probate involves  appraising  the property, paying debts, and distributing what's left.) When you make a living trust -- a device in which you hold property as a "trustee" -- your surviving family members can transfer your property quickly and easily, without probate.




Why You May Not Need a Living Trust
Some people need a living trust immediately, others will never need one, and most of us fall somewhere in the middle. Factors to consider are how old you are, how wealthy you are, and whether you are married.




Revocable Living Trusts
Revocable living trusts are a popular estate planning tool that you can use to determine who will get your property when you die.




Other Advantages of a Living Trust
The main reason for setting up a revocable living trust is to save your family time and money by avoiding probate after your death. But there are other benefits as well.









Common Questions About Living Trusts





Is a Living Trust Public?
One of the advantages of using a living trust, instead of a will, to leave the bulk of your property is that it gives your family more privacy.




Do Living Trusts Protect Assets from Creditors?
If you go to all the trouble of creating a trust to hold your money and other property, surely you’re safeguarding those assets, keeping them out of the hands of anyone who might sue you, right?

What Property to Put in a Living Trust
You're creating a revocable living trust primarily to avoid probate fees. And generally, the more an item is worth, the more it will cost to probate it. So you’ll probably want to hold your most valuable property items in the trust. Think about including: houses and other real estate (even if they're




Choosing a Successor Trustee
When you create a simple living trust to avoid probate, you must decide who to name as your “successor trustee.” It’s an important decision; this is the person who will take charge of the trust assets after your death, or sooner if you someday become incapacitated and unable to manage things yourself.

Amending or Revoking a Living Trust Document
Most of us make more than one will during our lifetimes; circumstances change, and our estate planning needs to change, too. Like a will, a living trust can be altered whenever you wish.

By Julie Garber


    	Updated February 04, 2017 
		


Married couples can maximize the use of both of their federal exemptions from estate taxes by using AB Trusts as part of their estate plan. The AB Trust system can be set up under the couples' Last Will and Testaments or Revocable Living Trusts. The "A Trust" is also commonly referred to as the "Marital Trust," "QTIP Trust," or "Marital Deduction Trust." The "B Trust" is also commonly referred to as the "Bypass Trust," "Credit Shelter Trust," or "Family Trust."







AB Trusts and Portability of the Estate Tax ExemptionNote that beginning in 2011, the federal estate tax exemption was made transferable between married couples. This is referred to as " portability of the estate tax exemption" and means that if one spouse dies in 2011 or later and his or her entire federal estate tax exemption is not needed to avoid estate taxes, then the unused portion of the deceased spouse's estate tax exemption can be added to the surviving spouse's estate tax exemption. This, in essence, means that in 2014 a married couple will be able to pass on up to $10,680,000 to their heirs free from federal estate taxes without the need to use AB Trust planning.So has portability of the estate tax exemption led to the extinction of AB Trusts? Not exactly. If the spouses have different sets of final beneficiaries, such as in the case of a second or later marriage where each spouse has their own children that they want to inherit their separate assets after both spouses are deceased, then the couple will want to make use of AB Trust planning in order to ensure that their separate beneficiaries will be their ultimate beneficiaries.


 In addition, since currently Hawaii is the only state among the states that collect an estate tax that has made its state estate tax exemption portable between married couples, AB Trust or ABC Trust planning may be required in these states in order to take advantage of both spouses' state estate tax exemptions.







  Finally, the federal generation-skipping transfer tax exemption is not portable, so couples who want to double the use of their GST exemptions will need to use AB Trust or ABC Trust planning to do so.How AB Trust Planning WorksHere is how the AB Trust system works to maximize the use of both spouses' estate tax exemptions: The couple includes the appropriate AB Trust language in their Last Will and Testaments or Revocable Living Trusts. Note that this should not be attempted without the assistance of a qualified estate planning attorney.  The couple divides their assets so that each spouse has about the same value of assets in his or her individual name or in the name of his or her Revocable Living Trust. This is an important step and must be done in order for the AB Trust system to work. Many times couples leave their assets in joint accounts and this completely voids the use of the AB Trust system since the joint assets will pass outright to the surviving spouse instead of through the deceased spouse's Last Will or Revocable Living Trust.  If the first spouse died in 2013, then the first $5,250,000 would be funded into the B Trust, and if the first spouse died in 2014, then the first $5,340,000 would be funded into the B Trust.  This effectively uses the federal exemption from estate taxes of the first spouse to die.  The B Trust can be relatively flexible and used for the benefit of the surviving spouse and descendants or other beneficiaries. 







 If the deceased spouse's assets exceed $5,250,000 in 2013 or $5,340,000 in 2014, then the excess is funded into the A Trust. This will defer the payment of estate taxes on the assets above the deceased spouse's exemption until after the surviving spouse's death. Because of this estate tax deferment, the A Trust is less flexible and can only be used for the benefit of the surviving spouse. In addition, federal law requires that the surviving spouse must receive all of the income from the A Trust in order for it to qualify for the unlimited marital deduction.  When the surviving spouse later dies, the surviving spouse will still have his or her own estate tax exemption. If the exemption is $5,340,000 when the surviving spouse dies, then the first $5,340,000 of the surviving spouse's separate assets will pass estate tax free to the final beneficiaries. Anything over $5,340,000 will be taxed. 

 The assets remaining in the B Trust pass estate tax free to the final beneficiaries. This is because the B Trust used up the federal estate tax exemption of the first spouse to die, so anything left in the B Trust will pass estate tax free. This can provide a significant windfall to the final beneficiaries if the surviving spouse does not need to use the assets from the B Trust and they continue to grow in value during the surviving spouse's remaining lifetime.  The assets remaining in the A Trust will be taxed as part of the surviving spouse's estate. As mentioned above, the estate tax on the A Trust is effectively deferred until after the surviving spouse dies.  The balance of the A Trust that remains after the estate tax bill is paid passes to the final beneficiaries. Note that the beneficiaries of the A Trust and B Trust can be different.As illustrated above, effective use of the AB Trust system allows married couples to pass on up to $10,680,000 to their final beneficiaries, free from any federal estate taxes. AB Trust planning also allows married couples to minimize estate taxes while insuring that the their separate estates will ultimately pass to the beneficiaries of their choice and in the manner of their choice.What Happens if the A Trust is Not Needed? Enter Portability of the Estate Tax ExemptionWhat happens if the value of the deceased spouse's estate is under the value of the federal estate tax exemption so that there is no need to establish and fund the A Trust? Then the unused portion of the deceased spouse's estate tax exemption can be transferred and added to the surviving spouse's estate tax exemption by timely filing a federal estate tax return, IRS Form 706. This will be important for couples who have lopsided estates (for example, a second or later marriage where one spouse is wealthier than the other) or where the surviving spouse's estate increases significantly in value after the first spouse's death.

AB Trusts: The Tax-Saver 






 Download article as a PDF










Normally, when one spouse dies passing on his/her assets in a last will and testament, the estate will be taxed heavily before the beneficiaries receive it. To avoid this steep estate tax, spouses can set up an AB trust, where each spouse leaves their property to an irrevocable trust. An AB trust is a trust created by married couples to maximize their federal estate tax exemptions. A lot of people believe that AB trusts only benefit those with large estates. The truth is anyone who may owe estate tax can benefit from an AB trust. Follow along as FindLaw helps you discover how AB trusts can be a tax-saver.
How the AB Trust System Works
When the first spouse dies, the beneficiaries (usually the couple's children) named in the trust receive that spouse's property. However, this irrevocable trust is to be used for the benefit of the surviving spouse, who does not technically own the property. There is a crucial condition that the property can be used by the surviving spouse and that the surviving spouse may even spend principal in certain instances. Once the surviving spouse dies, all the property rights and benefits of the irrevocable trust pass to the surviving beneficiaries of the trust. Because the surviving spouse does not own the property, it is not subject to estate tax. Setting up an AB trust this way keeps the portion of the surviving spouse's estate that is taxable half of what it would be without an AB trust.
Surviving Spouse's Rights Over the Assets
As mentioned, the AB trust is left with the condition that it is to benefit the surviving spouse. This gives the surviving spouse some power over the assets, depending on the provisions of the trust.
The surviving spouse's rights and benefits include receiving all income from the trust property, including:

Interest
Using the property
Spending to benefit his or her health, support and maintenance, standard of living, and education

The surviving spouse maintains these rights until her death, at which time all of the property is distributed to the beneficiaries of the original trust, and all of the surviving spouse's property is distributed to his or her beneficiaries.
Disadvantages of an AB trust
The AB trust is irrevocable. Once one spouse dies, there cannot be any changes made to the trust. This can create some issues and has even caused friction between the surviving spouse and the named beneficiaries of the trust. As mentioned, the surviving spouse's rights to use the property are limited. Where at one time this used to be the property he or she shared with his or her spouse, to do with as they pleased, this property is now restricted to certain uses and rights.
Settling and distributing property in an AB trust can be expensive and often requires a lawyer and accountant. Furthermore, these tax laws are always changing. You'll need to keep current, or hire a professional to keep you current, on these changes and what they mean for you and your trust. These changes may even encourage you to change or even revoke your trust.
There is a lot of paperwork and bookkeeping required in an AB trust. The surviving spouse needs a tax ID number for the irrevocable trust and must file annual income tax returns on the trust. He or she must also keep records of all the AB trust property.
Is an AB trust is Right for You?
An AB trust is best suited for those married couples who are both over the age of 60 and do not have children from previous marriages. Often times when there are children from previous marriages conflicts arise between the surviving spouse and the deceased spouse's children about who should share in the assets. If you think an AB trust might be for you or you have more questions, you should consult an attorney who can advise you based on your specific circumstances and your specific needs.
Free Initial Review of Your Estate Plan
As you are up reviewing estate planning options, you may want to strongly consider setting up an AB trust. If you have questions about how to maximize your federal estate tax exemptions or any other tax-related matter, now is the time to learn more. You can start the process with a free initial case review from an experienced attorney who specializes in tax law.

Trusts 
Trusts are estate-planning tools that can help you manage property during life while ensuring a smooth transition of affairs after death. The Trusts section of FindLaw's Estate Planning Center includes practical information on different types of trusts including living trusts and charitable trusts. You'll also find useful guidance on how to set up a living trust, choosing a trustee, tax implications of trusts, when it makes sense to hire an attorney and related issues.
Types of Trusts
There are many different kinds of trusts possible, though all trusts can be separated into two groups; revocable and irrevocable trusts. The key difference, that one can be revoked and the other cannot, is apparent in their names, though the reasons for selecting one or another has more to do with other details about ownership and control.
A revocable trust, often called a "living trust," are trusts in which the person making the trust transfers their title of property into the Trust, serves as the initial Trustee, and has the ability to remove, change, modify, alter, or entirely revoke the trust during their lifetime. Trusts of this sort are useful because the trust owns the property, rather than the person making the trust. As such, when the person dies the property held in trust is not subject to probate. An irrevocable trust, by contrast, is one that cannot be altered, changed, modified, or revoked once it has been created.
Revocable trusts may be vulnerable to claims by the creator's creditors. To access these assets the creditor will need to petition the court for an order enabling them to access the assets of the trust, but the control the trust maker maintains in trusts of this kind is precisely what makes the assets vulnerable to creditors. Upon death a revocable trust becomes irrevocable.
There are many kinds of revocable and irrevocable trusts. We detail many of the trust types and their characteristics elsewhere in this section.
Setting up a Trust
Trusts, regardless of their type, have some common features. A trust is a transfer of legal ownership of property or assets from the property owner, called the trustor, to a person or institution responsible for handling the property, called a trustee. This property is held for the benefit of a third party, called the beneficiary.
A trustee is often compensated for their management of the trust. Regardless of whether they are paid the trust creates a "fiduciary" relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary, meaning that they can only act in the interests of the beneficiary. The grantor may act as trustee, but they still have the fiduciary duty. The grantor may also be the beneficiary of a trust, or among several beneficiaries. The obligations created by these different roles are important to consider when establishing a trust.
Many factors can influence the procedure for setting up a trust, including the age, size of the estate, and the marital status of the trustor. We provide information on choosing a trustee, amending an existing trust, as well as why a trust might be useful and how a trust ends.

 AB Trusts
An AB trust is an estate planning device that allows married couples to reduce or avoid federal estate taxes. Estate taxes are taxes imposed on estates of a certain size (over $2 million for 2006-08) at the time of an estate holder's death. By dividing the trust into two parts when one spouse dies, an AB trust reduces the size of the overall taxable estate. With proper planning, a couple who creates an AB trust may avoid probate, escape estate taxes and preserve family assets. 
Structure
An AB trust is created by establishing a living trust with an AB provision. The trust remains revocable while both spouses are alive. Thus, the couple may withdraw assets or cancel the trust completely before one spouse dies. When the first spouse dies, the trust becomes irrevocable and splits into two parts: the A trust and the B trust. The A trust contains the surviving spouse's half of the estate. The surviving spouse controls all the property in the A trust and may receive distributions of income and principle as needed. The B trust contains the deceased spouse's half of the estate. The B trust belongs to the beneficiaries named in the trust—typically the couple's children. The surviving spouse has the right, however, to use the property contained in the B trust during life and to receive any income it generates. In certain situations, the surviving spouse may access the principe of the B trust. When the surviving spouse dies, the property in the B trust passes to the beneficiaries designated in the original trust document. The assets contained in the A trust are distributed to beneficiaries named by the surviving spouse.
Advantages of an AB Trust
The property in the B trust is never considered part of the surviving spouse's estate. Thus, only the property contained in the A trust is subject to estate taxes at the time of the surviving spouse's death. If the A trust contains less than the estate tax exemption, then no estate taxes will be imposed. Even if the trust contains more than the estate tax exemption, the total estate is significantly reduced. For example, if a surviving spouse dies in 2007 with no AB trust in place, and an estate worth $3 million, $1 million of the estate will be subject to estate taxes after the $2 million tax exemption is taken. With an AB trust, however, the surviving spouse's estate would be worth only $1.5 million. Because this is less than the $2 million estate tax exemption, no portion of the estate is subject to estate taxes. Additionally, property contained in a living trust is not subject to the probate system, which often results in significant expense and delays in asset distribution. 
Disadvantages of an AB Trust
There are several disadvantages to an AB trust. Accounting, legal and administration fees must be paid to maintain the trust. Additionally, after the death of the first spouse, the A and B trusts requires separate tax returns. The AB trust also limits the surviving spouse's rights to the trust property. A surviving spouse may feel entitled to all the property in the B trust, and may wish to spend the trust principle. This may conflict with the beneficiaries of the trust who wish to conserve the trust assets. Because an AB trust becomes irrevocable once the first spouse dies, an AB trust should be created only after consultation with an estate planning professional.

Estate planning arranges for the transfer of an individual's estate at the time of death. An estate consists of all property owned at death before it is distributed by will, trust, or intestacy laws. An estate may contain both real property (real estate, including houses and investment properties) and personal property (all other property, including bank accounts, securities, jewelry and automobiles). Typically, the process of estate planning involves extensive consultation with a number of professional advisors, including lawyers, financial counselors, accountants and life insurance representatives.
Purpose of Estate Planning
Estate planning benefits those with large estates, as well as those with modest assets. Creating an estate plan ensures that all property will be distributed according to the personal wishes of the deceased, and that those who are benefiting from the estate receive the largest distribution possible with a minimum amount of delay. Specifically, estate planning allows an individual to decide exactly who will benefit from their estate, and to what extent. Estate planning also ensures that the estate will not be destroyed by taxes imposed on the transfer of assets at death. In addition to providing financial security, estate planning encourages individuals to make important decisions, such as appointing a guardian for minor children, choosing healthcare preferences, and securing funeral arrangements.Estate Planning Tools
An estate plan is created to reach the specific goals of the estate owner. A number of tools may be utilized to ensure the best possible distribution of assets. The basic instruments used in estate planning are listed below. However, individual estate plans depend on the size of the estate, the number of beneficiaries, and the purpose of distributions.

The Will. The most common estate planning instrument is the will. A will sets forth who will inherit what property. Additionally, wills often appoint a guardian for minor children or specify what funeral arrangements should be made at the time of death. All wills must pass through probate, which may be a lengthy and expensive process. As a result, the will's beneficiaries may not receive the entire share specified in the will, and there may be a considerable delay in the distribution of assets. In the absence of a will or other testamentary instrument, the state will distribute an individual's estate according to the laws of intestacy. Generally, under the intestacy system, assets are divided in a particular order, to provide for a surviving spouse, issue, parents or siblings. 
The Trust. A trust is an arrangement by which a trustee distributes payments or property to a beneficiary according to the terms of the trust. A beneficiary may be a family member, a friend, a charity or a pet. A trust may be created during the individual's life, or it may be created by will. A trust created by will transfers property to the trustee at the time of the individual's death. By creating a trust, the beneficiaries to the estate bypass the probate process. 
Health Care Directives. Health care directives ensure that an individual's medical wishes will be carried out when they become unable to make their own health care decisions. Health care directives include a health care declaration and a power of attorney for health care. Health care directives, also known as "living wills," set forth an individual's personal decisions regarding healthcare at the end of their lives. A power of attorney for health care gives a family member or friend control of all health care decisions leading up to the person's death. 
Financial Power of Attorney. Finally, a financial power of attorney appoints a third party to handle an individual's finances when they can no longer take care of their own financial affairs. A financial power of attorney may designate a friend, family member, or a trusted professional to fulfill this position.

A trust is a right in property held by one person for the benefit of another. Trusts serve a variety of purposes and may take a number of different forms. A trust may be created to benefit a family member, a charity, or even a pet. Since trusts allow an individual to distribute his or her assets to others while minimizing estate, income, and gift taxes, trusts have become an essential component of estate planning. In the absence of nationally uniform trust legislation, individual states have developed their own laws to govern the establishment and maintenance of trusts. The Uniform Probate Code (UPC), which sets forth provisions relating to both wills and trusts, has been adopted in whole by over 30 percent of the states.
Creation of an Express Trust
Express trusts are created by a settlor, who transfers property to a trustee for a valid trust purpose. The trustee then distributes the trust property to a beneficiary pursuant to the terms of the trust. The following definitions elaborate on the essential components of an express trust:

The Settlor. The settlor, also known as the grantor or trustor, is the person who creates the trust and transfers trust property.
Trust Property. Any type of property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, may serve as trust property.
The Trustee. A trustee maintains the trust property and makes distributions to the beneficiary according to the terms of the trust. A trustee may be a person or a legal entity. The trustee owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiary, which includes protecting trust property, investing prudently, and making proper distributions.
The Beneficiary. The beneficiary to a trust is the person who benefits from the trust property. A beneficiary may be a single person, a group of people, an organization, or a pet. The beneficiary need not be in existence at the time the trust is created.
Trust Purpose. A trust must have a valid purpose. A valid purpose is defined as any legal purpose. Trusts are most commonly created to provide for support, education, asset protection, tax planning or to contribute to a charity.

Types of Express Trusts
Express trusts may take a number of different forms. The most common categories of express trusts are living trusts, testamentary trusts, revocable and irrevocable trusts, fixed trusts, and discretionary trusts.

Living Trusts. A living trust, or inter vivos trust, is created for the benefit of another during the settlor's life.
Testamentary Trusts. Testamentary trusts are created by a settlor's will. A settlor's property is therefore transferred into the trust when the settlor dies.
Revocable Trusts. A revocable trust allows the settlor to retain sole control of the trust. While the settlor does not receive any tax benefits from a revocable trust, the settlor can withdraw funds from the trust, or alter or cancel the trust at any time.
Irrevocable Trusts. The trustee of an irrevocable trust is given sole control over the trust property. Typically, the trust will not come to an end until the trust purpose is fulfilled. The trust may be altered or revoked before this time only with the consent of the trustee and all beneficiaries.
Fixed Trusts. Beneficiaries to a fixed trust receive trust property on a specific schedule set forth by the settlor. The trustee of a fixed trust has little or no discretion to distribute trust property.
Discretionary Trusts. A discretionary trust gives the trustee the power to choose how and when, if at all, to distribute trust property to beneficiaries. A discretionary trust may provide significant tax benefits to beneficiaries, since no beneficiary has an interest in trust assets until they are distributed.

Other Types of Trusts
While express trusts arise from the explicit instructions of a settlor, other types of trusts, such as constructive trusts and resulting trusts, are imposed by courts as equitable remedies that prevent unjust enrichment.

Constructive Trusts. A constructive trust is imposed when a wrongdoer acquires legal title to property that rightfully belongs to another. Under the constructive trust, the wrongdoer becomes the trustee of the property, with a duty to return the property to the true owner.
Resulting Trusts. A resulting trust arises when an express trust fails. The person who currently holds the property becomes a trustee and is obligated to return the trust property to the settlor.

Living trusts are an efficient and effective way to transfer property at your death to the relatives, friends, or charities you’ve chosen. Essentially, a living trust performs the same function as a will, with the crucial difference that property left by a will must go through the probate court process. In probate, a deceased person’s will is proved valid in court, the person’s debts are paid, and, usually after about a year, the remaining property is finally distributed to the beneficiaries. In the vast majority of instances, these probate court proceedings waste time and money.
By contrast, property left by a living trust can go promptly and directly to your inheritors. They don’t have to bother with a probate court proceeding. That means they won’t have to spend any of your hard-earned money to pay for court and lawyer fees.
 

Tip

You don’t need to maintain separate tax records for your living trust. While you live, all transactions that are technically made by your living trust are simply reported on your personal income tax return. Indeed, while some paperwork is necessary to establish a probate-avoidance living trust and transfer property to it, there are no serious drawbacks or risks involved in creating or maintaining the trust.
These trusts are called “living” or sometimes “inter vivos” (Latin for “among the living”) because they’re created while you’re alive. They’re called “revocable” because you can revoke or change them at any time, for any reason, before you die.
While you live, you effectively keep ownership of all property that you’ve technically transferred to your living trust. You can do whatever you want to with any trust property, including selling it, spending it, or giving it away. A revocable living trust becomes operational at your death. At that point, it allows your trust property to be transferred, privately and outside of probate, to the people or organizations you have named as beneficiaries of the trust.
Living Trusts Explained
A trust can seem like a mysterious creature, dreamed up by lawyers and wrapped in legal jargon. But don’t let the word “trust” scare you, even though it might initially sound impressive or even slightly ominous. True, trusts were an invention of medieval England, used by aristocrats to evade restrictions on ownership and inheritance of land. Also true, complex trusts have traditionally been used by rich American families to preserve their wealth over generations. But happily, the types of living trusts this book covers are not complicated or beyond the reach of regular folks. Here are the basics.
The Concept of a Trust
A trust is an intangible legal entity (“legal fiction” might be a more accurate term). Beyond a few pieces of paper, you can’t see a trust, or touch it, but it does exist. The first step in creating a working trust is to prepare and sign a document called a “Declaration of Trust.”
Once you create and sign the Declaration of Trust, the trust exists. There must, however, be a flesh-and-blood person actually in charge of this property; that person is called the “trustee.” With traditional trusts, the trustee manages the property on behalf of someone else, called the “beneficiary.” However, with a living trust, until you die you are the trustee of the trust you create and also, in effect, the beneficiary. Only after your death do the trust beneficiaries you’ve named in the Declaration of Trust have any rights to your trust property.
Creating a Living Trust
When you create a living trust document with this book, you must identify:
Yourself, as the “grantor”—or for a couple, the grantors. The grantor is the person who creates the trust.
The “trustee,” who manages the trust property. You are also the trustee, as long as you (or your spouse or partner, if you make a trust together) are alive.
The “successor trustee,” who takes over after you (or you and your spouse or partner) die. This successor trustee turns the trust property over to the trust beneficiaries and performs any other task required by the trust.
The “trust beneficiary” or “beneficiaries,” those who are entitled to receive the trust property at your death.
The “property” that is subject to the trust.
A Declaration of Trust also includes other basic terms, such as the authority of the grantor to amend or revoke the document at any time, and the authority of the trustee.
How a Living Trust Works
The key to establishing a living trust to avoid probate is that the grantor—remember, that’s you, the person who sets up the trust—isn’t locked into anything. You can revise, amend, or revoke the trust for any (or no) reason, any time before your death, as long as you’re legally competent. And because you appoint yourself as the initial trustee, you can control and use the property as you see fit while you live.
 




What Is Competence?




“Competent” means having the mental capacity to make and understand decisions regarding your property. A person can become legally “incompetent” if declared so in a court proceeding, such as a custodianship or guardianship proceeding. If a person tries to make or revoke or amend a living trust and someone challenges his or her mental capacity, or competence, to do so, the matter can end up in a nasty court battle. Fortunately, such court disputes are quite rare. However, if you suspect that someone in your life might question your capacity (and the validity of your estate plan), see a lawyer to help guard against a legal challenge to your estate.




 
And now for the legal magic of the living trust device. Although a living trust is only a legal fiction during your life, it assumes a very real presence for a brief period after your death. When you die, the living trust can no longer be revoked or altered. It is then irrevocable.




A Miniglossary of Living Trust Terms




Here are a few key words about living trusts that you’ll want to know as you read this chapter.  You’ll find a full glossary of trust-related terms in the back of the book, and Nolo provides a complete legal dictionary at www.nolo.com. Some basic terms:
The person who sets up the living trust (that’s you, or you and your spouse or partner) is called a grantor, trustor, or settlor. These terms mean the same thing and are used interchangeably.
All the property you own at death, whether in your living trust or owned in some other form, is your estate.
The market value of your property at your death, less all debts and liabilities on that property, is your net or taxable estate. The IRS allows your successor trustee to choose market value at your death or six months later.
The property you transfer to the trust is called, collectively, the trust property, trust principal, or trust estate. (And, of course, there’s a Latin version: the trust corpus.)
The person who has power over the trust property is called the trustee.
The person the grantor names to take over as trustee after the grantor’s death (or, with a trust made jointly by a couple, after the death of both spouses) is called the successor trustee.
The people or organizations who get the trust property when the grantor dies are called the beneficiaries of the trust. (While the grantors are alive, technically they themselves are the beneficiaries of the trust.)




 
With a trust for a single person, after you die, the person you named in your trust document to be successor trustee takes over. That person is in charge of transferring the trust property to the family, friends, or charities you named as your trust beneficiaries.
With a trust for a couple, the surviving spouse or partner manages the trust. A successor trustee takes over after both spouses or partners die.
There is no court or governmental supervision to ensure that your successor trustee complies with the terms of your living trust. That means that a vital element of an effective living trust is naming someone you fully trust as your successor trustee. If there is no person you trust sufficiently to name as successor trustee, a living trust probably isn’t for you. You could name a bank, a trust company, or another financial institution as successor trustee, but doing so has serious drawbacks.
After the trust grantor dies, some paperwork is necessary to transfer the trust property to the beneficiaries, such as preparing new ownership documents. But because no probate is necessary for property that was transferred to the living trust, the whole thing can generally be handled within a few weeks, often without a lawyer. No court proceedings are required to terminate the trust. Once the job of getting the property to the beneficiaries is accomplished, the trust just evaporates, by its own terms. See “Trust Administration After Death of a Grantor” in Chapter 14.
There are a few exceptions here. First, a wealthy couple may create an “AB disclaimer trust” to avoid probate and perhaps save on overall estate taxes. When one spouse dies, that spouse’s trust keeps going until the second spouse dies. A lawyer or another financial expert may need to be hired to divide the AB disclaimer trust property between that owned by the deceased spouse’s trust and that owned by the surviving spouse.
Another type of trust that can last for a long time is called a child’s trust. The trust forms in this book allow you to create a child’s trust if you wish, to leave trust property to one or more minors or young adult beneficiaries. These trusts are managed by your successor trustee and can last until the young beneficiary reaches the age you specified in your Declaration of Trust. Then the beneficiary receives the trust property, and the trust ends.
Probate and Why You Want to Avoid It
Given that you’re reading this book, you probably already know that you want to avoid probate. If you still need any persuasion that avoiding probate is desirable, here’s a brief look at how the process actually works.
Probate is the legal process that includes:
filing the deceased person’s will with the local probate court (called “surrogate” or “chancery” court in some places)
taking inventory of the deceased person’s property
having that property appraised
paying legal debts, including death taxes
proving the will valid in court, and
eventually distributing what’s left as the will directs.
If the deceased person didn’t leave a valid will, or a trust that distributes all of his or her property, the estate must still undergo probate. The process is called an “intestacy” proceeding, and the property is distributed to the closest relatives as state law dictates.
People who defend the probate system assert that probate prevents fraud in transferring a deceased person’s property. In addition, they claim it protects inheritors by promptly resolving claims creditors have against a deceased person’s property. In truth, however, most property is transferred within a close circle of family and friends, and very few estates have problems with creditors’ claims. In short, most people have no need of these so-called benefits, so probate usually amounts to a lot of time-wasting, expensive mumbo jumbo of aid to no one but the lawyers involved.
The actual probate functions are essentially clerical and administrative. In the vast majority of probate cases, there’s no conflict, no contesting parties—none of the normal reasons for court proceedings or lawyers’ adversarial skills. Likewise, probate doesn’t usually call for legal research or lawyers’ drafting abilities. Instead, in the normal, uneventful probate proceeding, the family or other heirs of the deceased person provide a copy of the will and other financial information. The attorney’s secretary then fills in a small mound of forms and keeps track of filing deadlines and other procedural technicalities. Some lawyers hire probate form preparation companies to do all the real work. In most instances, the existence of these freelance paralegal companies is not disclosed to clients, who assume that lawyers’ offices at least do the routine paperwork they are paid so well for. In some states, the attorney makes a couple of routine court appearances; in others, normally the whole procedure is handled by mail.
Because of the complicated paperwork and waiting periods imposed by law, a typical probate takes up to a year or more, often much more. (I once worked in a law office that was profitably entering its seventh year of handling a probate estate—and a very wealthy estate it was.) During probate, the beneficiaries generally get nothing unless the judge allows the decedent’s immediate family a “family allowance.” In some states, this allowance is a pittance—only a few hundred dollars.

Most states now allow simplified probate for certain types of estates. While simplified probate can speed up the process, and may even result in lower attorneys’ fees, the truth is that probate—simplified or not—is simply a waste for most people.
Probate usually requires both an “executor” (called a “personal representative” in some states) and someone familiar with probate procedures, normally a probate attorney. The executor is a person appointed in the will who is responsible for supervising the estate, which means making sure that the will is followed. If the person died without a will, the court appoints an “administrator” (whose main qualification may sometimes be that he or she is a crony of the judge) to serve the same function. The executor, who is usually the spouse, partner, child, relative, or friend of the deceased, hires a probate lawyer to do the paperwork. The executor often hires the decedent’s lawyer (who may even have possession of the will), but this is not required. Then the executor does little more than sign where the lawyer directs, wondering why the whole business is taking so long. For these services, the lawyer and the executor are each entitled to a hefty fee from the probate estate. Some lawyers even persuade clients into naming them as executors, enabling the lawyers to hire themselves as probate attorneys and collect two fees—one as executor, one as probate attorney. By contrast, most relatives and friends who serve as executors do not take the fee, especially if the person who serves is a substantial inheritor.
 




Extreme Probate Fees




Marilyn Monroe died in debt in 1962, but over the next 18 years, her estate received income, mostly from movie royalties, in excess of $1.6 million. When her estate was settled in 1980, her executor announced that debts of $372,136 had been paid, and $101,229 was left for inheritors. Well over $1 million of Monroe’s estate was consumed by probate fees.
Then there’s the 1997 U.S. Tax Court case upholding an attorney’s probate fee of $1,600 per hour for a total of $368,100. The court declared the fee was “reasonable under New York law.”




 
While probate can evoke images of greedy lawyers consuming most of an estate in fees, lawyers’ fees rarely actually devour the entire estate. In many states, the fees are what a court approves as “reasonable.” In a few states, the fees are based on a percentage of the estate subject to probate. Either way, probate attorneys’ fees for a routine estate with a gross value of $500,000 (these days, in many urban areas, this may be little more than a modest home, some savings, and a car) can amount to $10,000, $15,000, or more. Fees based on the “gross” probate estate means that debts on property are not deducted to determine value. For example, if a house has a market value of $700,000 with a mortgage balance of $500,000 (net equity of $200,000), the gross value of the house is $700,000.
Example: In California, lawyers’ probate fees are set by statute. (Section 10810, Cal. Prob. Code.) The fee for probate of a house is based on the gross value of that house. Given the prices of California real estate, this can result in a lot of money wasted on attorneys’ fees. For example, a house purchased for $150,000 years ago may now be worth $900,000. The probate fee for transferring this house will be $21,000. That fee will be charged no matter how little equity the owners have in the house.
In addition to the probate lawyer’s fees, there are executor’s fees, court costs, appraiser’s fees, and other possible expenses. Moreover, if the basic fee is set by statute and there are any “extraordinary” services performed for the estate, the attorney or executor can ask the court for additional fees.
Even England—the source of our antiquated probate laws—abolished its elaborate probate system years ago. It survives in this country, perhaps because it is so lucrative for lawyers.
Avoiding Probate
The most flexible and complete probate-avoidance method is, undoubtedly, the living trust. However, there are a number of other effective methods, some of which are quite easy and inexpensive to use.
Informal Probate Avoidance
You may wonder why surviving relatives and friends can’t just divide up your property as your will directs (or as you said you wanted, if you never got around to writing a will), and ignore the laws requiring probate. Some small estates are undoubtedly disposed of this way.
For example, say an older man lives his last few years in a nursing home. After his death, his children meet and divide the personal items their father had kept over the years. What little savings he has have long since been put into a joint account with the children anyway, so there’s no need for formalities there.
For this type of informal procedure to work, the family must be able to gain possession of all of the deceased’s property, agree on how to distribute it, and pay all the creditors. Gaining possession of property isn’t difficult when the only property left is personal effects and household items. However, if real estate, securities, bank accounts, cars, boats, or other property bearing legal title papers are involved, informal family property distribution can’t work. Title to a house, for example, can’t be changed on the say-so of the next of kin. Someone with legal authority must prepare, sign, and record a deed transferring title to the house to the new owners, the inheritors.
Further, whenever outsiders are involved with a deceased’s property, do-it-yourself division by inheritors is not feasible. For instance, creditors can be an obstacle; a creditor concerned about being paid can usually file a court action to compel a probate proceeding.
Another stumbling block for an informal family property disposition is disagreement among family members on how to divide the deceased’s possessions. All inheritors must agree to the property distribution if probate is bypassed. Any inheritor who is unhappy with the result can, like creditors, file for a formal probate. If there’s a will, the family will probably follow its provisions. If there is no will, the family may look up and agree to abide by the inheritance rules established by the law of the state where the deceased person lived. Or, in either case, the family may simply agree on their own settlement. For example, if, despite a will provision to the contrary, one sibling wants the furniture and the other wants the tools, they can simply trade.
In sum, informal probate avoidance, even for a small estate, isn’t something you can count on. Realistically, you must plan ahead to avoid probate.
Other Probate-Avoidance Methods
Besides the living trust, these are the most popular probate-avoidance methods:
joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety
pay-on-death financial accounts
transfer-on-death registrations
transfer-on-death real estate deeds
retirement accounts
life insurance
state laws that exempt certain (small) amounts of property left by will from probate, and
gifts made while you are alive.
These methods are discussed briefly in Chapter 15.

More on avoiding probate. These and other probate-avoidance techniques are discussed in detail in Plan Your Estate, by Denis Clifford (Nolo), and 8 Ways to Avoid Probate, by Mary Randolph (Nolo).
While I’m a fan of living trusts, I don’t believe they are always the best probate-avoidance device for all property of all people in all situations. It’s up to you to determine whether a living trust is the best way for you to avoid probate for all your property, or whether you want to use other methods.
Living Trusts and Estate Taxes
A basic probate-avoidance living trust, either for a single person or a couple, does not, by itself, reduce estate or inheritance taxes. The taxing authorities don’t care whether or not your property goes through probate; all they care about is how much you owned at your death. Property you leave in a revocable living trust is definitely considered part of your estate for federal estate tax purposes.
That said, some specialized types of living trusts (not the basic probate-avoidance kind), may save on estate taxes. This book contains one type of such trust —the AB disclaimer trust, explained in Chapter 5.
However, the usefulness of a tax-saving trust depends on whether your estate is likely to owe taxes—and most won’t. For deaths in 2017, only estates worth more than $5.49 million dollars will owe federal estate tax. (This exemption amount will rise with inflation in future years.) A handful of states also collect estate tax on large estates, and the exemption amounts on some of those taxes are lower than the federal exemption. But the vast majority of estates are not large enough to owe either federal or state estate tax, and so for most people there is no reason to create an estate-tax-avoiding trust.
If you’re worried about estate taxes, you can learn more about them and the AB disclaimer trust in Chapter 5.
Other Advantages of a Living Trust
As you know, the main reason for setting up a revocable living trust is to save your family time and money by avoiding probate. But there are also other advantages. Here is a brief rundown of the other major benefits of a living trust.
Out-of-State Real Estate Doesn’t Have to Be Probated in That State
The only thing worse than regular probate is out-of-state probate. Usually, an estate is probated in the probate court of the county where the decedent was living before he or she died. But if the decedent owned real estate in more than one state, it’s usually necessary to have a whole separate probate proceeding in each one. That means the surviving relatives must find and hire a lawyer in each state, and pay for multiple probate proceedings.
With a living trust, out-of-state property can normally be transferred to the beneficiaries without probate in that state.
You Can Avoid the Need for a Conservatorship
A living trust can be useful if the person who created it (the grantor) becomes incapable, because of physical or mental illness, of taking care of his or her financial affairs. The person named in the living trust document to take over as trustee at the grantor’s death (the successor trustee) can also take over management of the trust if the grantor becomes incapacitated. (See Chapter 7.) When a couple sets up a trust, if one person becomes incapacitated, the other takes sole responsibility. If both members of the couple are incapacitated, their successor trustee takes over. The person who takes over has authority to manage all property in the trust, and to use it for the benefit of the grantor or grantors.
Example: Wei creates a revocable living trust, appointing herself as trustee. The trust document states that if she becomes incapacitated, her daughter Li-Shan will replace her as trustee and manage the trust property for Wei’s benefit.
If there is no living trust and no other arrangements have been made for someone to take over property management if you become incapacitated, someone must get legal authority, from a court, to take over. Typically, the spouse, partner, or adult child of the person seeks this authority and is called a conservator or guardian. Conservatorship proceedings are intrusive and often expensive, and they get a court involved in your personal finances on a continuing basis.
 




Durable Power of Attorney




You should also give your successor trustee (or spouse) the authority to manage property that has not been transferred to the trust if you become incapacitated. The best way to do that is to prepare and sign a document called a “Durable Power of Attorney for Finances.” (See Chapter 15.)




 
Your successor trustee has no power to make health care decisions for you if you become incapacitated. If you have any end-of-life preferences—like to die without the unauthorized use of life support system—you’ll want to prepare and sign health care directives. (This is discussed in Chapter 15.)
Your Estate Plan Remains Confidential
When your will is filed with the probate court after you die, it becomes a matter of public record. A living trust, on the other hand, is a private document. Because the living trust document is never filed with a court or another government entity, what you leave, and to whom, generally remains private. There are just a couple of exceptions. First, records of real estate transfers are always public, so if your successor trustee transfers real estate to a beneficiary after your death, there will be a public record of it. Second, some states require the successor trustee to disclose information about your living trust to trust beneficiaries. These requirements are explained in Chapter 14.
A few states require that you register your living trust with the local court, but there are no legal consequences or penalties if you don’t. (Registration is explained in Chapter 12.) Also, registration of a living trust normally requires that you just file a paper stating the existence of the trust and the main players; you don’t file the document itself, so the terms aren’t part of the public record.
In most cases, the only way the terms of a living trust might become public is if—and this is very unlikely—after your death, someone files a lawsuit to challenge the trust or collect a court judgment you owe them.
You Can Change Your Mind at Any Time
You have complete control over your revocable living trust and all the property you transfer to it. You can:
sell, mortgage, or give away property in the trust
put ownership of trust property back in your own name
add property to the trust
change the beneficiaries
name a different successor trustee (the person who distributes trust property after your death), or
revoke the trust completely.
If you and your spouse or partner create the trust together, both of you must consent to changes, although either of you can revoke the trust entirely. (See Chapter 13.)
No Trust Record Keeping Is Required While You Are Alive
Even after you create a valid trust that will avoid probate after your death, you do not have to maintain separate trust records. This means you do not have to keep a separate trust bank account, maintain trust financial records, or spend any time on trust paperwork.
As long as you remain the trustee of your trust, the IRS does not require that a separate trust income tax return be filed. (IRS Reg. § 1.671-4.) You do not have to obtain a trust taxpayer ID number. You report all trust transactions on your regular income tax returns. In sum, for tax purposes, living trusts don’t exist while you live.
You Can Name Someone to Manage Trust Property for Young Beneficiaries
If there’s a possibility that any of your beneficiaries will inherit trust property while still young (not yet 35), you may want to arrange to have someone manage that property for them until they’re older. If they might inherit before they’re legally adults (age 18), you should definitely arrange for management. Minors are not allowed to legally control significant amounts of property, and if you haven’t provided someone to do it, a court will have to appoint a property guardian.
When you create a living trust with this book, you can arrange for someone to manage property for a young beneficiary. In most states, you have two options:
Have your successor trustee (or your spouse, if you created a shared living trust) manage the property in a child’s trust until the child reaches an age you designate.
In all states (except South Carolina), you can appoint an adult as a “custodian” to manage the property until the child reaches an age specified by your state’s Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (18 in a few states, 21 in most, but up to 25 in a few).
Both methods are explained in Chapter 9.
No Lawyer Is Necessary to Distribute Your Property
With a living trust, the person you named as your successor trustee has total control over how the property is transferred to the beneficiaries you named in the trust document. With a will, the executor is technically in charge of the property that passes under the terms of the will, but the probate lawyer usually runs the show. This can include the personal show as well as the silly court show. I’ve heard of a lawyer calling a family in for a reading of the deceased’s will immediately after the funeral service, which some family members found highly insensitive. There’s much less chance of this type of crassness if only close personal relations are involved in the transfer of the property.
Possible Drawbacks of a Living Trust
A basic living trust can have some drawbacks. They aren’t significant to most people, but you should be aware of them before you create a living trust. Aside from the problems discussed below, an AB disclaimer trust, which is designed to save on estate taxes as well as avoid probate, has a whole set of its own potential drawbacks, which are covered in Chapter 5.
Initial Paperwork
Setting up a living trust requires some paperwork. The first step is to create a trust document, which you must sign in front of a notary public. So far, this is the same amount of work as is required to write a will.
There is, however, one more essential step to make your living trust effective. You must make sure that ownership of all the property you listed in the trust document is legally transferred to the living trust. (Chapter 11 explains this process in detail.) Transferring property into your trust is simply a matter of doing the paperwork correctly. What you have to do depends on the kind of property you’re putting in the trust:
If an item of property doesn’t have a title (ownership) document, then in most states, listing it in the trust document is enough to transfer it. So, for example, no additional paperwork is legally required for most books, furniture, electronics, jewelry, appliances, musical instruments, paintings, and many other kinds of property.
If an item has a title document—real estate, stocks, mutual funds, bonds, money market accounts, or vehicles, for example—you must change the title document to show that the property is owned by the trustee of the trust. For example, if you want to put your house into your living trust, you must prepare and sign a new deed, transferring ownership from you to your living trust.
After the trust is created, you must keep written records sufficient to identify what’s in and out of the trust whenever you transfer property to or from the trust. This isn’t burdensome unless you’re frequently transferring property in and out, which is rare.
Example: Misha and David Feldman put their house in a living trust to avoid probate, but later decide to sell it. In the real estate contract and deed transferring ownership to the new owners, Misha and David sign their names “as trustees of the Misha and David Feldman Revocable Living Trust, dated March 18, 20xx.”
Transfer Taxes
Transfers of real estate to revocable living trusts are almost always exempt from transfer taxes usually imposed on real estate transfers.
If you’re the cautious type, you can check with your county tax assessor to learn if there will be any transfer tax imposed on transfer of your real estate to your trust. Your county land records office (county recorder’s office or registry of deeds) may also be able to provide this information. As I’ve said, you’re very likely to learn that no tax is imposed. If there is a tax but it is minor, it may impose no serious burden on creating your trust. If the tax is substantial, you may decide it’s too costly to place your real estate in a trust.
Difficulty Refinancing Trust Real Estate
Because legal title to trust real estate is held in the name of the trustee of the living trust—not your name—some banks, and especially title companies, may balk if you want to refinance it. They should be sufficiently reassured if you show them a copy of your trust document, which specifically gives you, as trustee, the power to borrow against trust property.
In the unlikely event you can’t convince an uncooperative lender to deal with you in your capacity as trustee, you’ll have to find another lender (which shouldn’t be hard) or simply transfer the property out of the trust and back into your name. Later, after you refinance, you can transfer it back into the living trust. It’s a silly process, but one that does work.
No Cutoff of Creditors’ Claims
Most people don’t have to worry that after their death creditors will try to collect large debts from property in their estate. In most situations, there are no massive debts. Those that exist, such as outstanding bills, taxes, and last illness and funeral expenses, can be readily paid from the deceased’s property. But if you are concerned about the possibility of large claims, you may want to let your property go through probate instead of a living trust.
If your property goes through probate, creditors have only a set amount of time to file claims against your estate. A creditor who was properly notified of the probate court proceeding cannot file a claim after the period—about six months, in most states—expires.
Example: Elaine is a real estate investor with a good-sized portfolio of property. She has many creditors and is involved in a couple of lawsuits. It’s sensible for her to have her estate transferred by a probate court procedure, which allows creditors to present claims, resolves conflicts, and cuts off the claims of creditors who are notified of the probate proceeding but don’t present timely claims.
On the other hand, when property isn’t probated, creditors still have the right to be paid (if the debt is valid) from that property. In most states, there is no formal claim procedure. (California has enacted a statutory scheme for creditors to get at property transferred by living trust.) The creditor may not know who inherited the deceased debtor’s property, and once the property is found, the creditor may have to file a lawsuit, which may not be worth the time and expense.
If you want to take advantage of probate’s creditor cutoff, you must let all your property pass through probate. If you don’t, there’s a good chance the creditor could still sue (even after the probate claim cutoff) and try to collect from the property that didn’t go through probate and passed instead through your living trust.

 An excellent guide to creating a living trust and why to do it by Paul S. 









                                                  I'm still working my way through this, however have been very impressed with the completeness and the discussions of when a living trust is applicable to a situation and when it is not.  It has relieved my concerns that trusts need to be created by attorneys alone.  An excellent guide which I highly recommend!                (Posted on 7/13/2017)

 Makes sense out of a complicated subject  by Anonymous 









                                                  I have found this book very helpful. Whether you wind up going to a lawyer or not, it is good to have a reference like this around the house. Every situation is different and a book such as this can't cover everything. That said, I have learned a lot and have been able to do a lot on my own. A very good investment. This is an ideal starting point.                 (Posted on 3/24/2017)

                                                  This is the second software I've purchased for this purpose. The first one was years ago and it had forms to fill in the blanks, similar to this one, but that one had many other forms to use also, like POA forms, and other planning tools. This one was difficult to save. I saved my first attempt and could not find it anywhere on the PC so had to copy and paste the form to Windows FIRST and then edit it on my own without the pre-shaded windows being there. NO instructions. Not really a great product to me.                (Posted on 2/21/2017)
