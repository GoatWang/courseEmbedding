Gregory D. Brenneman (born November 26, 1961)[1] is an American businessman, he currently serves as Chairman of CCMP Capital, an American private equity firm. Most recently, Brenneman had served as president and CEO of CCMP-owned Quiznos Sub, a fast-food sandwich chain. Brenneman also serves on the board of directors of The Home Depot, Inc. and Automatic Data Processing.
In June 2002, Brenneman was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of PwC Consulting, the management consulting and technology services business of PricewaterhouseCoopers. His initial plan was to lead the separation of PwCs consulting business its accounting & audit operations to avoid potential conflicts of interest where it serves as both the financial auditor and the consultant for a single company. However, IPO plans were quickly scrapped after an offer from IBM for $3.5B was received. The IBM PwC Consulting deal closed in October 2002.
From August 2004 through April 2006, Brenneman was CEO of the Burger King corporation, directing that company's turnaround efforts. He replaced Brad Blum in that role on August 31, 2004. Prior to his role at Burger King, Brenneman was President and COO[2] of Continental Airlines under Gordon Bethune. He came to Continental as a partner from Bain and Company. He graduated from Washburn University of Topeka, Kansas and was inducted into the school's prestigious Sagamore Society in 1982. He also has an M.B.A from Harvard Business School.

Gregory D. Brenneman (born November 26, 1961)[1] is an American businessman, he currently serves as Chairman of CCMP Capital, an American private equity firm. Most recently, Brenneman had served as president and CEO of CCMP-owned Quiznos Sub, a fast-food sandwich chain. Brenneman also serves on the board of directors of The Home Depot, Inc. and Automatic Data Processing.
In June 2002, Brenneman was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of PwC Consulting, the management consulting and technology services business of PricewaterhouseCoopers. His initial plan was to lead the separation of PwCs consulting business its accounting & audit operations to avoid potential conflicts of interest where it serves as both the financial auditor and the consultant for a single company. However, IPO plans were quickly scrapped after an offer from IBM for $3.5B was received. The IBM PwC Consulting deal closed in October 2002.
From August 2004 through April 2006, Brenneman was CEO of the Burger King corporation, directing that company's turnaround efforts. He replaced Brad Blum in that role on August 31, 2004. Prior to his role at Burger King, Brenneman was President and COO[2] of Continental Airlines under Gordon Bethune. He came to Continental as a partner from Bain and Company. He graduated from Washburn University of Topeka, Kansas and was inducted into the school's prestigious Sagamore Society in 1982. He also has an M.B.A from Harvard Business School.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
