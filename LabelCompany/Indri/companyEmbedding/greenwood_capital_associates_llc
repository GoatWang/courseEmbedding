												History									


Being "born" out of a recession has shaped the management of our firm and our investment products, leading us toward prudent growth while ever mindful of downside risks.

Our beginnings go back fifty years*, as the Investment Division of Greenwood Mills, a leading textile manufacturer. In 1983 the three person investment department was spun out of the Mill. The result was the formation of Greenwood Capital Associates, Inc. (GCAI), a registered investment advisory firm and predecessor to the current Greenwood Capital Associates, LLC.* Being "born" out of a recession has shaped the management of our firm and our investment products, leading us toward prudent growth while ever mindful of downside risks.
Today, the three employees have become seventeen and an original asset base of $100 million has grown to over $1 billion in assets under management with multiple offices. Nevertheless, in the institutional investment world we are still categorized as an "emerging manager." However, there are likely very few emerging managers with a history that is over 30 years in the making. With that in mind, we have reintroduced ourselves to the institutional marketplace through GCA Investments, focusing on continuing to provide our proven strategies to our existing clients while introducing ourselves to a broader audience.
 
*Prior to 2001, Greenwood Capital Associates and the term "Firm" refers to Greenwood Capital Associates, Inc. (GCAI) which was established in 1983. On or about June 29, 2001, Greenwood Capital Associates, LLC acquired substantially all the assets of GCAI, a sub-chapter S corporation. Greenwood Capital Associates, LLC registration dates back from 2001.
