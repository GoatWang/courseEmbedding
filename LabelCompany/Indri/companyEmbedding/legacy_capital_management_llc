+Our Strategy

+Our Process

+Our Team




Legacy Capital Partners is a real estate private equity firm founded in 2004. Our ability to create value and achieve superior returns for our investors rests on five fundamental beliefs:

1Investment strategies have a shelf life. That is why we invest with strategies that work now and can be deployed quickly.
2It’s all about the fundamentals. We are real estate professionals experienced in finance rather than finance professionals investing in real estate.
3Relationships matter. Great investments are made with great partners whose capacity and ethics make all the difference.
4Risk is reduced by having a defined and consistent process for how investment opportunities are analyzed.
5Managing other people’s money requires strong internal systems and controls.  We take our role as a fiduciary seriously.
 






+Our Strategy


Middle market real estate investors, deploying capital nationally through a series of focused funds with targeted strategies.
We focus on secondary markets and filter opportunities based on the partner, the location, and the investment’s ability to generate annual yield and capital appreciation.

+Our Process
Our investment process is from the ground up and begins in the trenches, as you would expect from an investment manager with deep roots in real estate development. We strive to reduce the probability of investment errors through a defined sequence of actions; our investment process is the same regardless of fund strategy. It’s what differentiates us from other managers.Click here to learn more about our process.





+50Fund® Investing
“Legacy Capital Partners didn’t set out to create a new asset class, although that may very well be the by-product of our thinking.”David St. Pierre | Co-Founder and PresidentThere is a real possibility that Legacy Capital Partners’ 50Fund® investment model will change how many investors allocate capital. Fund Managers are constantly told that in order to attract larger investors and raise more capital, they need to raise bigger funds.At Legacy Capital Partners we believe that bigger funds are not necessarily better. Raising 50 million dollars per fund allows us to systematically deploy capital into focused investment strategies. It eliminates the pressure to chase deals to “get the dollars out.” 50Fund® Investing provides our investors a single stop for deploying significant capital into real estate through a menu of multiple funds with specific strategies designed to take advantage of timely opportunities in the market.Click here to learn more about Legacy’s next 50Fund®.

Lago Paradiso at the Hammocks
Legacy Capital Partners (Legacy) has created LAC Lago Paradiso LLC (Company) to provide accredited investors the opportunity to invest in Lago Paradiso at the Hammocks, a 424-unit garden style apartment community in Miami (Kendall), FL. (“Lago Paradiso” or “Project”). Lago Paradiso was built in 1987 and represents an opportunity to invest in a well-located community that will provide stable in-place cash flow and value appreciation through increased rental rates tied to significant renovations of unit interiors, building exteriors and common areas.
Legacy entered into a joint venture with Electra Multifamily Investment Fund (EMIF), to acquire the Lago Paradiso on May 31, 2017. This represents the thirteenth joint venture between Legacy and the CEO of EMIF. The purchase price was $61,236,600 and the total cost, including $8,413,400 for renovations, contingencies and closing costs, was $69,650,000. This represents a purchase price of $144,000 per unit and a total cost of $164,300 per unit which compares favorably to recent comparable sales in the market. The acquisition and renovation was capitalized with a loan in the amount of $46,875,000 and equity in the amount of $22,775,000. Legacy invested $9,300,000, EMIF invested $9,475,000 and a third party invested $4,000,000.
The investment strategy is to renovate the entire property - unit interiors, building exteriors, common areas, amenities, landscaping, and clubhouse - during the first 12 months of ownership. Approximately $10,000 per unit has been capitalized to complete these improvements. The unit interior renovations will be completed as lease renewals occur to allow each unit to be upgraded during the initial year. The underwriting assumes the renovations will allow the Project to achieve rental rate increases of $209 per unit on average over the Project’s in-place rental rates and in-line with rental rates at nearby competitive properties. Given the strength of the surrounding market and metro, the planned renovations combined with operational improvements should allow Lago Paradiso to compete favorably with comparable properties and generate the desired financial performance.
The Company is offering 87.72 Membership Units for an aggregate purchase price of $4,386,000, or $50,000 per Membership Unit. The minimum investment will be two (2) Membership Units for an
aggregate purchase price of $100,000 and the maximum investment will be six (6) Membership Units for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000. However, the Manager may, in its sole discretion, accept investments for less than two (2) or greater than six (6) Membership Units. Investors will receive an 8% preferred return on their invested capital paid from net cash flow, refinance proceeds or sale proceeds. After the preferred return is paid current, investors will receive 80% of excess net cash flow. Once the preferred return is paid current and 100% of the investors’ capital has been returned, the investors will receive 80% of excess refinance and/or sale proceeds.
To request a Private Placement Memorandum please contact us at legacy@LCP1.com or 216-381-2303.
