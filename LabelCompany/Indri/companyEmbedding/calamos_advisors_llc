Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
Important Fund Information

The Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest up to 100% of their assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.

Investments by the Funds in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk--that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest--and interest rate risk--that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of the debt securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will decline.

Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest in derivative securities. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Funds will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Funds pay a premium whether or not an option is exercised.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

"Throughout my internship I completed tasks that I now continue to do on a monthly basis for my job. 
		The knowledge I gained from completing reconciliations and other tasks in my internship allowed for 
		my transition to the full time position to be smooth."
"The Calamos internship program really prepared me for life in the real world. The collegial atmosphere 
		created a great working environment and the project driven workload taught me how to successfully 
		balance a full time schedule. I would not be where I'm at today without Calamos."
"When you intern at Calamos, you gain valuable knowledge and skills that you can't find in a 
		classroom. The Calamos Internship Program prepares you for life after college."

Our People

Take It From Them






At Calamos, I have been fortunate enough to experience both professional and personal 
			growth. Calamos recognizes and rewards those who are committed to the future of the 
			company, think like owners, and achieve results.  Above all, my role has given me the ability 
			to work with clients in building their financial future; and to work with a team of self-starters 
			who are as dedicated as I am to the progress of this group and the greater organization.

Anita K., Wealth Management








I started my career in 2001 working as a Systems Support Specialist on the Desktop Support Team.  
			Through the guidance of my peers, the educational assistance program, and working with highly-motivated 
			Associates, I was able to advance my career to a management level.   Working on the Systems 
			Support Team gives me the ability to work with a breadth of technologies that assist with 
			keeping our associates highly productive.  I love working with my staff and understanding 
			why top-notch talent is so important to servicing the client.

Jim P., IT - Enterprise Services








I have worked at Calamos since 2005. Coming to Calamos from a large Internationally 
			based firm has been extremely rewarding.  I went from feeling like an employee number 
			to feeling like a valued associate with the ability to add input to the direction of the 
			department I work in and the firm as a whole. We focus on hiring the best talent and then growing that 
			talent in-house with an emphasis on education, training and development. As a manager my 
			best reward is to see associates move up within the organization and grow their careers 
			here at Calamos.

Brian W., Intermediary Sales








As a professional in the Learning and Performance Field it is exciting for me to work for a 
			company like Calamos Investments which is committed to being a learning organization. Calamos 
			promotes continuous learning and development in a variety of ways including supporting 
			associates who wish to achieve industry-related designations and the multitude of 
			learning resources available on the Calamos Academy Virtual Campus.
In addition to this focus on learning, I consider myself blessed to work with such 
			great colleagues.  Each day I get the privilege of working with intelligent, hard-working 
			associates who are very supportive.

Tom K., Training & Human Resources

Nasdaq tower announces the IPO of CCD
 


 

 




 





 


NAPERVILLE, Ill., March 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Calamos Investments, a pioneer in convertible securities investing since the 1970s, today announced the completion of pricing for the initial public offering of the Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund (NASDAQ:   CCD). The new closed-end fund raised $555 million (or 22,200,000 common shares at a price of $25.00 per share) in its common share offering, excluding any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional common shares. If the underwriters exercise that option in full, the fund will have raised approximately $638.25 million. Assuming the use of leverage of approximately 28% of the fund's managed assets, it is anticipated that the fund's managed assets will exceed $845 million. The fund is the first closed-end fund IPO since November 2014 and the first such convertible offering since 2007.  The fund will begin trading today on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CCD.
Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund is designed to offer total return through a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing primarily in a portfolio of convertible and income producing securities, including high yield bonds. To help generate income and attempt to achieve a more favorable reward/risk profile, the fund has the flexibility to opportunistically write options on a portion of the portfolio's securities.
The fund includes a term limit provision, a feature not commonly seen in the closed-end fund arena, which provides that the fund will terminate on its 15th anniversary in 2030, unless the term is extended by the fund's board of trustees for up to one year or shareholders elect to eliminate or extend the term.
Also, Calamos Investments is pleased to announce an investment advisor share purchase program after expiration of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Under this program, Calamos Advisors LLC and/or its affiliates have committed to purchase up to $20 million worth of common shares of CCD under certain predetermined criteria for a limited period following CCD's IPO.  
"With the launch of CCD, Calamos Investments continues its legacy of innovation and shareholder focus within the closed-end fund marketplace. We are pleased to offer investors a product that draws upon the firm's nearly four-decades of leadership in convertible securities in a way that is both innovative and timely," says John P. Calamos, Sr., CEO and Global Co-CIO of Calamos Investments.
The fund plans to pay its first monthly distribution 60-90 days after its IPO date and will seek to provide predictable, monthly distributions through the implementation of a level distribution policy. 
Calamos Advisors LLC, a subsidiary of Calamos Investments, is the fund's advisor and oversees a range of investment strategies. The lead managers of the underwriting syndicate were Wells Fargo Securities, Ameriprise Financial Services, BofA Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets.
Calamos Investments also manages five other closed-end funds, exceeding more than $6.2 billion in total AUM.

Important Risk Information
The fund is a newly organized, diversified, closed-end management investment company designed primarily as a long-term investment and not as a trading tool. The fund invests in a globally diversified portfolio of convertible securities, debt and equity income-producing securities as well as other investments that generate current income and dividends. An investment in the fund's common shares may be speculative and it involves a high degree of risk. The fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Due to the uncertainty in all investments, there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective.
The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the fund.
Before investing carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please see the prospectus containing this and other information or call 1.800.582.6959. Read it carefully before investing. 
A registration statement relating to the fund's common shares has been filed with, and declared effective by, the Securities and Exchange Commission. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction.  Before investing, an investor should carefully read the fund's prospectus, which includes a discussion of the fund's investment objective, risks, fees and expenses. A copy of the final prospectus relating to the offering of the fund's common shares may be obtained from the fund without charge by calling 1.800.582.6959. 
Certain statements in this press release constitute forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.  Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the satisfaction of closing conditions for the fund's initial public offering, the decision of the underwriters to exercise the over-allotment option, the amount of shares purchased under the advisor share purchase program and the ability of the fund to make level cash distributions to shareholders.
Calamos Investments LLC, referred to herein as Calamos Investments®, is a financial services company offering such services through its subsidiaries: Calamos Advisors LLC, Calamos Wealth Management LLC, Calamos Investments LLP and Calamos Financial Services LLC.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
