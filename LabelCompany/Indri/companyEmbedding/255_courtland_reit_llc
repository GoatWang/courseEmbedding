The city's third-largest hotel has sold for $146 million.
An entity called 255 Courtland LLC acquired the 1,242-room downtown Atlanta hotel and its parking deck on Oct. 22, according to Fulton County court records. According to state records, the buyer shares an address with Manhattan-based Apollo Global Management LLC (NYSE:APO).

Atlanta Business Chronicle reported in 2012 that the Hilton Atlanta was on the market.





The previous owners (Houston-based Westmont Hospitality Group and Montreal, Canada-based Ivanhoé Cambridge) acquired the hotel, an adjacent office tower and a parking garage (a 4.8-acre parcel) for $180 million in 2007, according to real estate research firm Databank Inc. The building finished construction in 1976 and includes about 120,000 square feet of meeting space.
The hotel underwent a $65 million renovation of its rooms, lobby and meeting space in 2009. A pedestrian bridge also was built in 2009 to connect the Hilton to the city’s largest hotel, the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.
Paces Properties Inc., the same developer behind Krog Street Market, recently bought the office tower adjacent to the Hilton Atlanta and converted it into apartments called "The Office."
The volume of Atlanta hotel sales this year could break records — a nod to the hospitality sector’s strong performance and to the high level of development across the city.
Among the big sales, on July 1, Ashford Hospitality Trust (NYSE: AHT) closed on the acquisition of the 237-room W Atlanta Downtown hotel for $56.8 million ($239,000 per key).
Other hotels are under contract. For example, Richmond, Va.-based Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) has under contract the 128-room Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel, which is now under construction at 85 Walton St.




 


And, several big-name hotels are on the market, including the W Atlanta Midtown, Twelve Centennial Park and Twelve Atlantic Station.

Amy Wenk covers hospitality, retail and restaurants.

Another iconic Atlanta restaurant is making way for new development.
In 2013, Dante’s Down the Hatch shut down and sold its prime Peachtree Road property for an apartment tower.

                            Hard Rock Hotel set to open in 2018 next to Mercedes-Benz Stadium.                        










 


Earlier this year, Manuel’s Tavern decided to sell its land to Green Street Properties for a new mixed-use project where a refurbished Manuel’s will be located.
Now, Buckhead’s iconic Henri’s Bakery and Cafe is looking to makea similar move.
Phoenix, Ariz.-based Alliance Residential Co. is in advanced talks to acquire 61 Irby Ave. in the Buckhead Village — where Henri’s has been located since 1969 — and plans to build an apartment project in its place.
The site is nearly 0.6 acres and last sold in 1986 for $50,000, according to Fulton County property records. Today, it’s valued at $1.2 million, according to the county. Yet, land values in the Buckhead Village have recently soared to more than $10 million per acre.
If the deal goes through, Alliance intends to relocate Henri’s to the ground floor of the development when it’s complete. During construction, Henri’s would operate from a temporary location nearby.
“We are ensuring our grandfather’s legacy lives on in the same location,” said Henri’s owner Madeline Leonard, whose grandfather Henri Fiscus in 1929 opened the bakery on the corner of Peachtree and 10th streets. Over the years, it moved around to several locations including Rhodes Center, Peachtree Palisades and the corner of Peachtree and Piedmont Avenue before settling in its current location on Irby Avenue in 1969. The family opened a second location in Sandy Springs in 1984.
Leonard has been running the business with several family members (sisters Suzette DiNardo, Mimi Veerkamp and Michelle Teihaber, and brother Henri Ray Bell) since her grandfather died in 1974.




Henri’s is well known for its baked goods including croissants, pastries, cookies, cakes and pies, as well as donuts and deli sandwiches.
“My grandfather was an unbelievable man and a wonderful chef and community business owner,” Leonard said. “We appreciate all of our customers. We love our staff and everyone who has enjoyed our cheese straws, cookies and sandwiches over the years.”

Hard Rock Hotel set for downtown
Atlanta is set to get a Hard Rock Hotel.
Hard Rock International will open in spring 2018 a 220-room Hard Rock Hotel Atlanta on Centennial Olympic Park Drive next to Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
The Hard Rock Hotel Atlanta would come to a roughly $70 million project called Castleberry Park that also includes apartments, retail space and a park.
The hotel is being developed in partnership with an entity called Bolton Atlanta LP. It’s being funded through the EB-5 program, part of the Immigrant Investor Program established by Congress in 1990 to stimulate the economy through job creation and capital investment by immigrant investors.
“The new Hard Rock Hotel in Castleberry Hill will offer a new, best-in-class option for the millions of people visiting Atlanta each year,” Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said in an announcement. “In addition to serving tourists and visitors, this new hotel will serve as a powerful economic anchor, bringing new jobs and further investment to our downtown corridor and stadium neighborhoods.”




 


The hotel would include an outdoor swimming pool, rooftop bar and more than 10,000 square feet of meeting space. Expect live entertainment shows and music memorabilia that will line the hotel walls.
“The area’s energetic atmosphere and history of embracing artistic endeavors aligns well with the Hard Rock Hotel product and we’re sure the upcoming property will quickly become the go-to entertainment and leisure destination,” said Frank Chen, general manager of Bolton Atlanta LP, the ownership group for the Castleberry Park development project.
Hard Rock International today operates 22 hotels and 11 casinos spanning 10 countries, including the United States, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. It claims to owns the world’s greatest collection of music memorabilia, which began with an Eric Clapton guitar.
Hilton Atlanta sells
The city’s third-largest hotel has sold for $146 million.
An entity called 255 Courtland LLC acquired the 1,242-room downtown Atlanta hotel and its parking deck on Oct. 22, according to Fulton County court records. According to state records, the buyer shares an address with Manhattan-based Apollo Global Management LLC (NYSE: APO).
The previous owners (Houston-based Westmont Hospitality Group and Montreal, Canada-based Ivanhoé Cambridge) acquired the hotel, an adjacent office tower and a parking garage (a 4.8-acre parcel) for $180 million in 2007, according to real estate research firm Databank Inc. The building finished construction in 1976 and includes about 120,000 square feet of meeting space.
The hotel underwent a $65 million renovation of its rooms, lobby and meeting space in 2009. A pedestrian bridge also was built in 2009 to connect the Hilton to the city’s largest hotel, the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.
Paces Properties Inc., the same developer behind Krog Street Market, in 2014 bought the office tower adjacent to the Hilton Atlanta and converted it into apartments called “The Office.”
The volume of Atlanta hotel sales this year could break records — a nod to the hospitality sector’s strong performance and to the high level of development across the city.
Among the big sales, on July 1, Ashford Hospitality Trust (NYSE: AHT) closed on the acquisition of the 237-room W Atlanta Downtown hotel for $56.8 million ($239,000 per key).
Other hotels are under contract. For example, Richmond, Va.-based Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) has under contract the 128-room Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel, which is now under construction at 85 Walton St.
And, several big-name hotels are on the market, including the W Atlanta Midtown, Twelve Centennial Park and Twelve Atlantic Station.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
