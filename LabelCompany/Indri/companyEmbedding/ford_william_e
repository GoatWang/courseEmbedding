Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club.

Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90.

Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

William E. Kennard
Member, Board of Directors, Ford Motor Company
William E. Kennard was elected to the Ford Motor Company board of directors in 2015. He serves on the nominating and governance committee.
Kennard is non-executive chairman and cofounder of Velocitas Partners, an asset management firm, and is a member of the operating executive board of Staple Street Capital, a private equity firm. He serves on the board of AT&T, MetLife and Duke Energy Corporation. He has a rich history with telecommunications and media industries, having served as director of several public companies including Sprint Corporation, FON Group (formerly Sprint Nextel Corporation), The New York Times Company and Dex Media, as well as a number of private companies.

Kennard served as United States Ambassador to the European Union from 2009 to 2013, working to promote transatlantic trade and investment and to eliminate regulatory barriers to commerce. He was a key force behind President Barack Obama’s decision in 2013 to launch negotiations on the ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic.

From 2001 to 2009, Kennard was managing director of global private equity firm The Carlyle Group, leading investments in the telecommunications and media sectors. From 1997 to 2001, he was chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, shaping policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and incentivized billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world.

U.S. News and World Report dubbed Kennard a “consumer champion for the digital age.” He has received honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University, and awards from Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Easter Seals Foundation, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union.

Kennard has served on several nonprofit boards including Yale University Council, Gallaudet University, Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies and One Economy Corporation. Kennard serves as a fellow of the Yale Corporation and is a member of Secretary of State John Kerry’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board.

He graduated from Stanford University and earned a law degree from Yale Law School.

William Clay Ford Jr.
Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company
As Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. is leading the company that put the world on wheels into the 21st century. He joined the Board of Directors in 1988 and has been its chairman since January 1999. Through the years, his vision for the company has remained unchanged.
“I believe the purpose of a company is to make people’s lives better,” he says. “That is how we became great in the past and it is how we will become even greater in the future.
Under Bill Ford’s leadership Ford Motor Company was named the Best Global Green Brand among all companies in the world in 2014, and one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the seventh year in a row in 2016.
“The ongoing success of Ford Motor Company is my life’s work,” he says.  “Nothing is more important to me than our reputation as a family company that people trust to do the right thing.”
After joining the company in 1979 as a product planning analyst, he held positions in manufacturing, sales, marketing, product development and finance. During the 1982 Ford-United Auto Workers labor talks, which launched the employee involvement movement that revolutionized the industry, he served on the company’s National Bargaining Team. In 1983 he began a 12-month course of study as an Alfred P. Sloan fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was elected chairman and managing director of Ford Switzerland in 1987.
As head of Business Strategy for the Ford Automotive Group in 1990, he helped develop guidelines for establishing low-volume manufacturing plants in emerging markets. After being appointed general manager of Climate Control Division in 1992, he led a profit turnaround and a major improvement in product quality. He also established the company’s first wildlife habitat at a plant location and the first automotive plant in the world to use 25 percent post-consumer materials in all of its plastic parts. While he was general manager the division won the President’s Commission on Environmental Quality Award.
Bill Ford was elected a company vice president and head of the company’s Commercial Truck Vehicle Center in 1994. He left that position in order to assume the chairmanship of the Board of Directors’ Finance Committee in 1995. In addition to his duties as chairman, he served as chief executive officer of the company from October 2001 to September 2006, when he was named executive chairman. As CEO, he improved quality, lowered costs and delivered exciting new products. During his time in that position he took the company from a $5.5 billion loss in 2001 to three straight years of profitability.
A lifelong environmentalist, Bill Ford is committed to developing products that benefit customers and society. Under his leadership, in 2000 Ford Motor Company published its first corporate citizenship report outlining the economic, environmental and social impact of company products and operations around the world. In 2004, the company completed the world’s largest brownfield reclamation project, the restoration of its Ford Rouge Center in metropolitan Detroit. He also championed the Escape Hybrid, the world’s first hybrid-electric sport utility vehicle.
“During the last industry downturn, Ford invested heavily in fuel economy and technology at a time when many others were pulling back,” he says. “It absolutely was the right thing to do.”
Looking to the future, in 2011 he began outlining the company’s vision of what sustainable transportation will look like in the years ahead, as well as the steps it will take to get there. That future includes vehicles that communicate with each other and the world around them to make driving safer, ease traffic congestion and sustain the environment. As the next step in these efforts, in 2015 the company announced Ford Smart Mobility, its plan to deliver advances in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and data and analytics.
“My great-grandfather helped put the world on wheels so everyone could enjoy the benefits of mobility,” he says. “Our vision is to expand on that thinking, using advanced technology and new business models so that personal mobility remains viable in a crowded world.”
Bill Ford’s charitable, volunteer and business efforts are highlighted by his commitment to the city of Detroit. As vice chairman of the Detroit Lions professional football team, he led efforts to build a new, environmentally-friendly stadium in Detroit that was the site of Super Bowl XL. Through Detroit Lions Charities, he helped develop the Detroit Police Athletic League youth football program into one of the largest in the country.
Under his leadership the company’s philanthropic arm, Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services, focused its efforts on helping communities, supporting education and improving safety through driving skills training. In 2005 he launched the Ford Volunteer Corps to enhance the efforts of employee volunteers serving communities around the world. In its first ten years, Ford 30,000 volunteers worked on more than 9,000 projects in 40 countries.
In 2015, he championed the 30 Under Thirty program to develop the next generation of Ford philanthropic leaders and the Bill Ford Better World Challenge, which provides grant funding for projects that engage employees and local nonprofits in addressing needs that will improve community life and make people’s lives better.
Bill Ford is Chairman of the Board of the Detroit Economic Club, a member of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford and the Henry Ford Health System, and is Chairman of the New Michigan Initiative of Business Leaders for Michigan. He also served on the Board of Directors of eBay Inc. from 2005 to 2015. He was inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame in 2011. He also is a founding partner of Fontinalis Partners, LLC, a Michigan-based investment firm that acts as a strategic operating partner to transportation infrastructure technology companies. 
In recognition of his commitment to education and devotion to the Detroit community, in 2015 he was given the Ambassador for Humanity Award by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute.
Bill Ford was born in Detroit in May 1957. He is an avid fly fisherman and car enthusiast, enjoys playing hockey and tennis, and is a martial arts black belt.
He holds a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton University and a master of science degree in management from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also has been awarded an honorary doctor of environmental sciences and engineering degree from Koc University, an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Michigan, an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Bradley University and an honorary doctorate of economic science from University College Cork and the National University of Ireland.

Longtime Lehigh County judge stepping down.




After 24 years of hoisting a gavel, Lehigh County Judge William E. Ford has decided to step down from the bench.The 64-year-old Allentown Republican will leave his post at the end of the year to open his own law firm in Center City, focusing on civil litigation, mediation and estate law."It's been wonderful," Ford said, "but I feel that I'm ready for a new challenge. As a judge, I see all areas of the law. When I see an area that I haven't practiced, or see a lawyer coming up with a new solution to a problem, I think, 'Why haven't I tried that before?' I think it will be intellectually stimulating."Ford said he's also motivated by all the growth in downtown Allentown, and believes there's room for more attorneys there.

"It's all very exciting and I want to be a part of it," he said.During his tenure, Ford worked in all four divisions of the court — civil, criminal, family and orphans court. He currently oversees criminal court and adoption hearings.Ford was elected in 1991 and retained for 10-year terms in 2001 and 2011. He submitted his resignation to Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday, and is leaving four years into his current term.Ford's departure will leave a vacancy on the bench that can only be filled by gubernatorial appointment, since it comes too late for a special election. The state's current budget impasse makes an appointment unlikely, said Kerry R. Turtzo, the county's deputy district court administrator.

"We've heard throughout the state that it's just not happening," he said.Ford's announcement coincides with Senior Judge Lawrence J. Brenner's exit. Brenner must step down because he's reached the mandatory senior judge retirement age of 78, Turtzo said.Turtzo said other judges will take over Ford's caseload, and a senior jurist from Philadelphia, Judge John L. Braxton, has committed to spending one week each month in Lehigh to hear cases."It's going to be lean," Turtzo said.Ford said he's going to miss wearing the black robe. Being a judge was satisfying, he said, especially when he had the opportunity to help someone who came before him."Judges are in a position to correct things, and to right a wrong. When that happens, it's very rewarding," he said.Ford said he hopes to emulate the attorneys he's observed from the bench who are caring champions."Working with lawyers who truly care about their clients has been a highlight of my career," he said. "A caring attitude really helps achieve the best result in a case."He said he'll miss the courthouse staff, which he called the "most professional" in the region.A graduate of DeSales University, Ford received his law degree from the Dickinson School of Law in 1975. He has lectured at DeSales, Muhlenberg and Chestnut Hill colleges.Ford served as a captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Marine Reserve from 1975 to 1979. He was a county prosecutor from 1979 to 1991.He is a former basketball coach for the Catholic Youth Organization and former baseball coach for the West End Youth Association, and has been involved in numerous other civic organizations and charities.Ford and his wife, Rosemary, have 11 children, who range in age from 25 to 43 years old. He said the family is very excited about his next career move."Everyone has offered to help. We're all very energized," he said.lmason@mcall.comTwitter @LehighCourts610-820-6506
