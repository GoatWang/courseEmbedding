SAN FRANCISCO, July 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:   RPXC), the leading provider of patent risk management and discovery management solutions, today announced that it has appointed Andrew D. Africk to its Board of Directors.  With the addition of Mr. Africk, RPX's Board of Directors will now include eight directors, seven of them independent. 
About Andrew Africk








Mr. Africk, 50, has over 20 years of corporate management and director experience. Africk founded Searay Capital LLC, a private investment company, in 2013.  He previously spent 21 years at Apollo Global Management LLC, an alternative asset management firm, including as a senior partner responsible for Apollo's investments in technology and communications such as Apollo's purchases of Intelsat Ltd. (a global provider of commercial satellite services) and Hughes Communications, Inc. (a leading provider of satellite technology).  Africk is currently a director of SunCoke Energy, Inc. (NYSE:   SXC). Africk has a Juris Doctor degree, magna cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and holds an MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.  In addition, Africk holds a B.A. in Economics, summa cum laude, from the University of California at Los Angeles.
About RPX
RPX Corporation is the leading provider of patent risk management and discovery management solutions.  Since its founding in 2008, RPX has introduced efficiency to the patent market by providing a rational alternative to litigation. The San Francisco-based company's pioneering approach combines principal capital, deep patent expertise, and client contributions to generate enhanced patent buying power. By acquiring patents and patent rights, RPX helps to mitigate and manage patent risk for its growing client network.
As of March 31, 2016, RPX had invested over $2 billion to acquire more than 15,000 US and international patent assets and rights on behalf of more than 250 clients in eight key sectors: automotive, consumer electronics and PCs, E-commerce and software, financial services, media content and distribution, mobile communications and devices, networking, and semiconductors.
RPX subsidiary Inventus is a leading international discovery management provider focused on reducing the costs and risks associated with the discovery process through the effective use of technology solutions.  Inventus has been providing litigation support services to corporate legal departments, law firms and government agencies since 1991.

               Company: Trinity School
Job Details
               The PA Diversity Committee's mission is to support Trinity School's efforts in promoting empathy, inclusiveness and respect. By exploring our differences with each other and helping our children to do so, we learn what ties us together as human beings. We strive to create a safe haven for voicing our diverse perspectives, and we reject discrimination, intolerance and bias of any kind. We acknowledge that the definition of diversity is in constant flux. For our purposes today, diversity within our community is represented by a range of the following identities: culture, ethnicity, physical attributes (including size, accent, disabilities), learning styles, family structure, gender, national origin, race, age, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economics. It is through an awareness of these differences that we strive to raise children to be truly accepting. Furthermore, in order to be prepared for a highly competitive world, in which diversity is the rule rather than the exception, our children will be better equipped as global citizens if we all (parents, students and faculty) work together to celebrate each other's differences with empathy and respect.
