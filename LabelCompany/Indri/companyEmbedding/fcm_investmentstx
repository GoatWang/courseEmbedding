Our Capabilities: Flexible Global Style

While some clients have a U.S.-only equity portfolio, most of our clients are invested according to our "flexible global" style
We define flexible global as being willing to be fully invested in a global equity portfolio but not requiring it at all times

Additionally, we search for other assets that are expected to produce equity-like returns but are not stocks and are not correlated with the stock market. We call this eclectic asset category "Non-equity Assets" 
In the past, our Non-equity Asset category has included such investments as long maturity Treasury Strips, "inverse floater" mortgage backed securities, and precious metals

The Non-equity Assets added to a global portfolio usually ranges from 10% to 25% of the total, depending on circumstances

Our Philosophy

The beauty of discipline
We are long term investors in quality assets
Quality, for us, is defined by financial characteristics, success of the business and solid management, not by how well known the company is
Quality assets, whether municipal bonds or growth stocks, must be bought well, at a discount to their inherent value
This requires the discipline to determine a true sense of the fair value of the asset
Doing our own research gives us the conviction to be contrarian at key junctures — willing to buy when others pass, willing to sell an investment that has become overly popular, and willing to hold an attractive security through a volatile period
Our approach leads to low portfolio turnover, which is generally more tax efficient

MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 10 Hold Ratings, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.38)Consensus Price Target: $122.67 (0.66% downside)
