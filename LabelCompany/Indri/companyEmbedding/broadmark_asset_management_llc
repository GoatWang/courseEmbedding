Our History

Tactical Investment Management
Broadmark Asset Management LLC rejects traditional buy and hold investing. We are a macro top-down manager with a history of tactically adjusting equity market exposure while seeking to avoid major drawdowns. Based on decades of reviewing market history and ongoing analysis of macroeconomic shifts using qualitative and quantitative methodologies, we dynamically reposition a portfolio’s exposure with a focus on risk management, intending to preserve capital.
Our flexible investment mandate allows us to be long, short or hold cash equivalents based on our assessment of market risk. We believe that being fully invested in equities during periods of intense speculation and monetary tightening within an overvalued market is unwise. Therefore, when we believe market risks are high and opportunities are low, our portfolios may not be fully invested in equities. We define risk as 'loss of capital,' and our team has an impressive history of managing drawdowns.
For more details on Broadmark Asset Management, our investment team and tactical investment strategies, please continue exploring this site.

Investment Team
Each member of the Broadmark Asset Management LLC investment team is involved in the tactical investment process developed by Christopher J. Guptill, CIO and Co-CEO. Utilizing its members’ complementary skills, the team evaluates risk by qualitatively assessing variables such as valuation, monetary policy and investor sentiment. The team relies on its volume, breadth and momentum models, adhering to the famous words of the late Marty Zweig, “Don’t fight the tape.” Mr. Guptill and his team use investment risk management tools to determine how much equity exposure is prudent and tactically adjust the portfolio at any time. We believe avoiding major drawdowns, i.e., loss of capital, is of utmost importance. Mr. Guptill is responsible for all final investment decisions.

Christopher J. Guptill
CIO and Co-CEO

As Chief Investment Officer of Broadmark Asset Management LLC, Christopher J. Guptill is responsible for the development of Broadmark’s investment programs and products, as well as the implementation of all portfolio management decisions. In his role of Co-Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Guptill shares in managing the firm’s business operations with Ricardo L. Cortez.

	Mr. Guptill began his career in the investment industry in 1979 as a registered representative with Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis. Over the next 15 years, he developed a methodology for identifying risk in the market, which led to the creation of a tactical investment process.

	In developing this process, Mr. Guptill examined the underlying conditions present during market highs and lows over the prior 75 years. Noting the variables consistently present at market extremes, he sought to replicate a means to position a portfolio appropriate for market conditions. The resulting investment process utilizes a qualitative assessment of valuation, monetary policy and takes a contrarian view of investor sentiment. 

	By evaluating price, volume, breadth and momentum models, Mr. Guptill identifies market trends. He exploits directional moves in the market by tactically exposing portfolios to equity indices when trends indicate rising positive returns, while moving to a higher cash and lower market exposure position when deterioration in the factors of valuation, monetary factors, sentiment and momentum emerge. The process has always focused on a top-down, macro approach rather than bottom-up stock selection. By managing investment risk and rejecting the traditional buy and hold approach, Mr. Guptill focuses on avoiding major drawdowns and loss of investor capital, seeking to produce a positive rate of return in any market environment.

	In 1994 Mr. Guptill joined McKinley Capital Management as Senior Portfolio Manager and continued his tactical investment approach as the firm’s Chief Equity Strategist. While there, he developed, launched and co-managed the firm's highly successful alternative investment portfolios. During his tenure, the firm’s assets under management increased from $80 million to nearly $2 billion.

	In 1999, Mr. Guptill became founding Chief Investment Officer of the newly formed Broadmark Asset Management LLC. He firmly believes that when market risks are high and the opportunities are low, investors should reduce their exposure to equities. Avoiding major drawdowns is at the very core of all of Broadmark investment decisions. 

	Mr. Guptill is a graduate of California State University, Chico with a B.A. in Economics.

Ricardo L. Cortez, CIMA® 
Co-CEO

As Co-Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Cortez is responsible for the management of Broadmark’s day-to-day business activities as well as the oversight of the firm’s sales and marketing efforts. In addition, he is a member of the Investment Team and serves as the firm’s Chief Risk Officer. Mr. Cortez joined Broadmark in September 2009 as President, Global Distribution and was named Co-CEO in June 2013. Before Broadmark, he was President of the Private Client Group for Torrey Associates, LLC. Additional prior roles include Vice President at Goldman Sachs serving as Product Manager of the firm’s Global Multi-Manager Strategies program, and Senior Vice President with Prudential Investments overseeing product development and sales for the Investment Management Services Division.

He is also an adjunct faculty member at Harvard University and has been a guest lecturer on Investment Policy and Hedge Funds at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Cortez was awarded the Certified Investment Management Analyst® designation in 1993 and is the author of numerous published articles on hedge funds.

Richard P. Damico
Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Trading

Mr. Damico joined Broadmark in March 2005. As a Senior Portfolio Manager, he participates in the implementation of portfolio management.  He brings over 20 years of hands-on trading experience to the firm and, as Head of Trading, is responsible for all trading functions. Prior to joining Broadmark he was a Managing Director at ThinkEquity Partners, LLC where he established and was responsible for the institutional trading desk at their San Francisco headquarters. Prior to ThinkEquity Partners, from 1997 to 2002, he was a Vice President and Senior Institutional Sales Trader at Morgan Stanley’s San Francisco office covering West Coast institutional accounts. Additionally, Rick was an Associate Director and Senior Sales Trader at Bear Stearns in San Francisco from 1990 to 1997.

Francis T. Mullen
Senior Managing Director and Portfolio Management Specialist

Mr. Mullen has been a member of the investment team since joining the firm in January 2002. He has over 25 years of experience in the financial services industry and has an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the firm’s investment process. Previously, Mr. Mullen was Managing Director and Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets at Putnam Lovell LLC. While at Putnam Lovell, he established and developed their Research, Institutional Equity Sales, Equity Syndicate and Trading Departments in San Francisco and New York.

Company Description


Broadmark Asset Management LLC is a U.S. Registered Investment Adviser with approximately $1.8 billion in assets under management as of March 2013. The firm manages or sub-advises hedge funds, institutional separate accounts in hedge fund strategies, U.S. mutual funds and an Irish UCITS.
 
We believe that equity market risk can and should be addressed, and that there are times when a buy and hold strategy fails over long periods. These perspectives are central to our investment approach.
 
Our multi-factor process was developed over the past 30 years and has been successful in identifying opportunities over time. Broadmark's investment strategy seeks to produce above-average, risk-adjusted returns in any market environment while exhibiting less downside volatility than the broad equity market. We believe that equity risk can be reduced and returns can be enhanced with a strategy that provides managed net exposure and capital preservation, rather than a long only and fully invested equity position

Joseph L. Schocken, President


Mr. Schocken is the Founder and President of Broadmark Capital, LLC, a FINRA Member broker-dealer. With nearly 40 years in investment banking, Mr. Schocken has extensive knowledge of the financial services industry and established relationships with both strategic and institutional investors throughout the United States and internationally. He has guided Broadmark's corporate finance practice through hundreds of private equity transactions with an aggregate transaction value measured in the billions. These projects have included private placements, debt offerings, mergers, asset purchases and public offerings in a broad array of industries including technology, life science, broadcasting and travel. In addition, Mr. Schocken leads Broadmark's merchant banking and family office activities, overseeing what has become a significant portfolio of private and public company holdings.

              As an outgrowth of Broadmark's entrepreneurial merchant banking practice, Mr. Schocken was one of the founding partners in Pyatt Broadmark Management, LLC (PBM, and its affiliate, Broadmark Real Estate Management, LLC), a five year old real estate lending firm with approximately $150M in assets under management. PBM writes first deed of trust loans against hard assets located in the Pacific Northwest and is filling a significant gap in the credit markets following the 2007-2008 real estate crisis. Indeed, it is private lenders like PBM that have fostered such a fundamentally strong rebound in the Pacific Northwest's real estate market. Using PBM as a model, Broadmark Capital is expanding its lending operations into markets outside the Pacific Northwest. Prior to PBM, Mr. Schocken helped form Broadmark Asset Management Company and received both a direct investment and a $100M allocation from CALPERS in 2000.

              Throughout his career as a banker, investor, board member and mentor, Mr. Schocken has also played a pivotal role in the development of numerous significant enterprises. Notable examples include Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ: OMER), Bennett Environmental (AMEX: BEL), Optiva (acquired by Phillips), Universal Access, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAXS) and Lindblad Expeditions, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIND). In each case, Mr. Schocken served as an influential advisor to management in the development of the capital formation strategy that positioned each company for growth.

              Outside of banking, Mr. Schocken has long been active with the Democratic National Committee, has served on the DNC national finance committee, and has been involved in numerous local and national campaigns. He has been actively involved in U.S. jobs creation policy, particularly during the Obama administration. His white paper, "Restarting IPOs: The Shortest Path to Recreating Economic Growth in the United States", served as the basis for elements of the JOBS act of 2012. Mr. Schocken personally lobbied for the bill and proudly sat with the president when he signed it into law with broad, bipartisan support. Among other things, the legislation streamlines the application process for certain companies to go public, allows businesses to advertise to more investors and should ultimately enable crowdfunding. It has dramatically improved the process private firms use to go public. Our country saw the most initial public offerings in the past year since 2000, with 365 companies going public.

            Mr. Schocken is active in civic affairs. He has provided leadership for the movement to protect Alaska Airlines, Seattle's hometown airline, against a takeover by Delta. He has also voiced his support and contributed to numerous campaigns including gun control and same sex marriage legislation.
 
Mr. Schocken has long been active in community affairs serving on numerous boards and committees. He currently serves on the AIPAC National Council and the local Community Relations Committee. 
 
His commentaries are regularly published and he is often quoted for articles concerning economic and political issues, samples of which are below:

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Welcome to Broadmark Asset Management
At the core of Broadmark Asset Management’s investment philosophy is equity market risk management. Founded in 1999, we are a macro, top-down manager with a tactical approach. Our investment process is a rejection of traditional buy and hold investing. This approach allows us to operate with a flexible investment mandate to navigate through all market environments. Our portfolios can be long, short or hold cash or cash equivalents based on our assessment of market risk. Broadmark offers its strategies through mutual funds as sub-advisor, a private fund or institutional separate accounts, in the US. Outside of the US, Broadmark offers investors its strategy, as sub-advisor, via a UCITS and institutional separate accounts.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
