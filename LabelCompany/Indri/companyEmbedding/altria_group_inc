History[edit]
Altria emerged from Philip Morris. The onset of "rebranding" of Philip Morris Companies to Altria took place in 2003 (Philip Morris would later split, with PM USA remaining Altria's primary and only consistently held asset). Altria was created because Philip Morris wished to emphasize that its business portfolio had come to consist of more than Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International; at the time, it owned an 84% stake in Kraft,[2] although that business has since been spun off.[3] The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high" and was part of a trend of companies rebranding to names that previously did not exist, Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and Verizon being notable examples,[4] though linguist Steven Pinker suggests that in fact the name is an "egregious example" of phonesthesia — with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".[5]
The company's branding consultants, the Wirthlin Group, said: “The name change alternative offers the possibility of masking the negatives associated with the tobacco business,” thus enabling the company to improve its image and raise its profile without sacrificing tobacco profits.[6]
Philip Morris executives thought a name change would insulate the larger corporation and its other operating companies from the political pressures on tobacco.[6]
The rebranding took place amidst social, legal and financially troubled circumstances.[vague][7] In 2003 Altria was ranked Fortune number 11, and has steadily declined since. In 2010 Altria Group (MO) ranked at Fortune number 137, whereas its former asset, Philip Morris International, was ranked 94th.[8]
In 2006, a United States court found that Philip Morris "publicly ... disputed scientific findings linking smoking and disease knowing their assertions were false." [9]
On March 30, 2007, Altria's 88.1% stake in Kraft Foods Inc was spun off, through a distribution of the remaining stake of shares (88.1%) to Altria shareholders. That same year, Altria began selling all its shares of Philip Morris International to Altria stockholders, a spin off that was completed on March 28, 2008. Again in 2007 the company began the acquisition of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Co. from Bradford Holdings, Inc., which was complete in 2008. After Philip Morris International spun off, the former international subsidiaries halted the purchase of tobacco from America, which was a major factor in the closing of a newly renovated plant in North Carolina, an approximately 50% reduction in manufacturing, large-scale layoffs, and induced early retirements.[10]
In 2008, Altria officially moved its headquarters from New York City to Richmond, Virginia after Philip Morris sold its downtown offices in New York City a decade earlier. With a few exceptions, all manufacturing, commercial, and executive employees had long been based in and around Richmond. Currently the company is headquartered in an unincorporated area within Henrico County, less than five miles west of the city limits of Richmond and less than ten miles from its downtown Richmond campus.
Aside from the Philip Morris/Altria headquarters, some of their other buildings included the Philip Morris Center for Research and Technology in downtown Richmond, their manufacturing center in South Richmond, and the adjacent operations center which began shutting down in 2007-2008, as a result of the loss of demand from PMI member companies. The layoffs beginning in 2007 affected thousands of Altria, Altria Client Services, Philip Morris USA, and contracted employees in Richmond and North Carolina.
In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates).[11] This ended a short era of competition between the new Marlboro smokeless tobacco products such as snus, and those produced by UST Inc.

Headquarters[edit]
Prior to being based in Virginia, Philip Morris had its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[13] In 2003, Philip Morris announced that it would move its headquarters to Virginia. The company said that it planned to keep around 750 employees in its former headquarters. Brendan McCormick, a spokesperson for Philip Morris, said that the company estimated that the move would save the company over $60 million each year.[14] The company now has its head offices in an unincorporated area of Henrico County, Virginia, in Richmond.[15] In addition, the company has a 450,000-square-foot, $350 million Center for Research and Technology located in downtown Richmond at the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park that employs approximately 600 scientists, engineers and support staff.
Political influence[edit]
According to the Center for Public Integrity, Altria spent around $101 million on lobbying the United States government between 1998 and 2004, making it the second most active organization in the nation.[16][17]
Altria also funded The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition which lobbied against the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.[18]
Daniel Smith, representing Altria, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[19]

In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates).[11] This ended a short era of competition between the new Marlboro smokeless tobacco products such as snus, and those produced by UST Inc.

The company said that it planned to keep around 750 employees in its former headquarters. Brendan McCormick, a spokesperson for Philip Morris, said that the company estimated that the move would save the company over $60 million each year.[14] The company now has its head offices in an unincorporated area of Henrico County, Virginia, in Richmond.[15] In addition, the company has a 450,000-square-foot, $350 million Center for Research and Technology located in downtown Richmond at the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park that employs approximately 600 scientists, engineers and support staff.
Political influence[edit]
According to the Center for Public Integrity, Altria spent around $101 million on lobbying the United States government between 1998 and 2004, making it the second most active organization in the nation.[16][17]
Altria also funded The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition which lobbied against the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.[18]
Daniel Smith, representing Altria, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[19]

History[edit]
Altria emerged from Philip Morris. The onset of "rebranding" of Philip Morris Companies to Altria took place in 2003 (Philip Morris would later split, with PM USA remaining Altria's primary and only consistently held asset). Altria was created because Philip Morris wished to emphasize that its business portfolio had come to consist of more than Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International; at the time, it owned an 84% stake in Kraft,[2] although that business has since been spun off.[3] The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high" and was part of a trend of companies rebranding to names that previously did not exist, Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and Verizon being notable examples,[4] though linguist Steven Pinker suggests that in fact the name is an "egregious example" of phonesthesia — with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".[5]
The company's branding consultants, the Wirthlin Group, said: “The name change alternative offers the possibility of masking the negatives associated with the tobacco business,” thus enabling the company to improve its image and raise its profile without sacrificing tobacco profits.[6]
Philip Morris executives thought a name change would insulate the larger corporation and its other operating companies from the political pressures on tobacco.[6]
The rebranding took place amidst social, legal and financially troubled circumstances.[vague][7] In 2003 Altria was ranked Fortune number 11, and has steadily declined since. In 2010 Altria Group (MO) ranked at Fortune number 137, whereas its former asset, Philip Morris International, was ranked 94th.[8]
In 2006, a United States court found that Philip Morris "publicly ... disputed scientific findings linking smoking and disease knowing their assertions were false." [9]
On March 30, 2007, Altria's 88.1% stake in Kraft Foods Inc was spun off, through a distribution of the remaining stake of shares (88.1%) to Altria shareholders. That same year, Altria began selling all its shares of Philip Morris International to Altria stockholders, a spin off that was completed on March 28, 2008. Again in 2007 the company began the acquisition of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Co. from Bradford Holdings, Inc., which was complete in 2008. After Philip Morris International spun off, the former international subsidiaries halted the purchase of tobacco from America, which was a major factor in the closing of a newly renovated plant in North Carolina, an approximately 50% reduction in manufacturing, large-scale layoffs, and induced early retirements.[10]
In 2008, Altria officially moved its headquarters from New York City to Richmond, Virginia after Philip Morris sold its downtown offices in New York City a decade earlier. With a few exceptions, all manufacturing, commercial, and executive employees had long been based in and around Richmond. Currently the company is headquartered in an unincorporated area within Henrico County, less than five miles west of the city limits of Richmond and less than ten miles from its downtown Richmond campus.
Aside from the Philip Morris/Altria headquarters, some of their other buildings included the Philip Morris Center for Research and Technology in downtown Richmond, their manufacturing center in South Richmond, and the adjacent operations center which began shutting down in 2007-2008, as a result of the loss of demand from PMI member companies. The layoffs beginning in 2007 affected thousands of Altria, Altria Client Services, Philip Morris USA, and contracted employees in Richmond and North Carolina.
In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates).[11] This ended a short era of competition between the new Marlboro smokeless tobacco products such as snus, and those produced by UST Inc.

Altria Group Inc. in 2 Charts
Understand the basics behind the tobacco conglomerate's business.











                Dan Caplinger
            

                (TMFGalagan)



            
            Jan 20, 2017 at 12:20PM
            
            





Tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE:MO) has been the most successful stock of all time in the eyes of many investors. With a combination of strong earnings growth and rising dividends, Altria has used the power of its Marlboro brand to dominate its competition. Yet many don't understand the role that Altria's other business segments play, and although smokeable tobacco still makes up the huge majority of Altria's business, the diversification that it gets from its other subsidiaries is valuable. Below, you'll see two charts that provide a snapshot of Altria and where it's getting its success right now.
Image source: Altria.
Smokeable products still bring in most of Altria's sales...
The cigarette business has always been the most important for Altria, and with the company having spun off most of its holdings in other industries over the years, most notably the food and snack business, smokeable products remain vital. In 2015, smokeable products brought in $16.4 billion in revenue net of excise tax for Altria, compared to just $1.75 billion from smokeless products and $668 million for the wine segment.
Data source: Altria Group investor relations.
Within the smokeable products segment, Marlboro plays a dominant role in driving Altria's success. In 2015, the company shipped more than 108 billion Marlboro cigarettes. Even though that number was down about 3% from 2013, it still represented more than 85% of all of Altria's cigarette shipments. Other premium brands had shipments of 6.75 billion cigarettes, while Altria shipped 11.15 billion discount cigarettes during the year.
Altria also has its cigar business within the segment. The Black & Mild brand is the key there, but shipments are still relatively small, at less than 1.3 billion cigars for the full year.
...but margins for smokeless products are better
When you turn your attention to operating profit, the smokeable products segment still dwarfs its counterparts. However, some small changes in percentages reveal interesting facts about the respective businesses.
Data source: Altria Group investor relations.
Smokeable products brought in $7.57 billion in operating profit before tax in 2015, compared to $1.11 billion from smokeless products and $152 million from wine. Those numbers don't move the needle much for the smokeable segment, but notice that the share of smokeless products rises from 9% of revenue to 12% of pre-tax profit.
Altria's smokeless products have gotten a growth boost lately, and the motivation is obvious: Profit margin for the segment is higher even than for smokeable products, and far greater than margin in the wine business. Excise taxes for smokeless products are somewhat lower than for cigarettes, which has a substantial impact on segment profitability. Moreover, Altria's market share is higher in smokeless tobacco than in cigarettes, showing its command of the niche.
In response, the company has focused on growth of the key Copenhagen brand. New flavors have both retained existing customers and brought in new ones and generated excitement about the segment. As long as those trends continue, Altria will put effort into growing its smokeless business despite its being a small part of the company's overall success.





Will the trend continue?
Looking forward, one of the biggest growth opportunities that Altria has is in cigarette alternatives, including electronic cigarettes using liquid vapor or heated tobacco. Altria has exclusive rights to market the iQOS heat-not-burn system in the U.S., and its former subsidiary has filed for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to support its reduced-risk claims for iQOS. Investors shouldn't expect quick action from the FDA on the application, but if it does end up being approved, it could be a game changer for Altria. Already, test markets like Japan have shown the potential that iQOS has, and the U.S. market is an even larger opportunity. If reduced-risk product innovations prove as lucrative as tobacco companies hope, then Altria could see even more revenue and profit coming into its smokeless products segment.
For now, though, cigarettes are still the most essential part of Altria's overall business. Even if growth in the smokeable products market flattens out entirely or even declines slightly, it will still take a long time for other segments to make a big dent in Marlboro's dominance.

Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report)	 is encouraged by the fact that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has filed Philip Morris International, Inc.’s (PM  -  Free Report)	 application for iQOS heated tobacco product. The FDA has started reviewing the Modified Risk Tobacco Product application, which was submitted on Dec 5, 2016.On Mar 31, 2017, Philip Morris had applied for pre-market approval of iQOS heated tobacco product with the FDA. Yesterday, the FDA published the executive summary and research summaries. In addition, the agency will publish additional modules of Philip Morris’ MRTP application on a rolling basis. The timeframe for the review of Philip Morris’ application is solely at the discretion of the FDA.Upon regulatory authorization of the iQOS heated tobacco products, Philip Morris USA, a subsidiary of Altria, will have an exclusive license to sell these products in the United States. The tobacco industry is under pressure to replace cigarettes with other alternatives due to the dip in smoking rates in developed countries. Health hazards due to smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk or reduced-risk products. To cater to the new consumer preferences, Altria has collaborated with Okono A/S and developed innovative, non-combustible nicotine-containing products for adult smokers. Its flagship MarkTen e-cigarette brand (launched in 2014) and Green Smoke e-vapor products are some of the examples. MarkTen XL – a variant on MarkTen launched by the company in 2016 have been encouraging in lead markets.At the end of 2016, MarkTen represented about 55% of the e-vapor category volume in retail channels, including c-stores. In Apr 2017, Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10,000 more stores. Further, it announced the availability of three more flavors for its adult papers – winter mint, summer fusion and smooth cream.The agreement between Philip Morris Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies. Per the agreement, Philip Morris markets Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria distributes two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the U.S. The companies have also extended their technology sharing agreement signed in Jul 2015 to work on a joint research, development and technology-sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes. Such collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteAltria recently reported weaker-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2017 as both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company kept earnings guidance intact for 2017. The company’s strong brand portfolio, shift to low-risk, smokeless tobacco products and strong pricing remains encouraging. The company’s flagship brand, Marlboro, has been performing well and has boosted its market share.PM USA, Altria’s smokeable subsidiary invests continuously in improving the brand architecture of Marlboro and has upgraded its shopping website – marlboro.com – which provides engaging content directly to adult smokers through mobile devices. It is also trying to enhance the brand equity of the Marlboro brand and has offered Marlboro Slate, a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family. Further, it has acquired Nat Sherman, in order to augment the smokeable segment. Nat Sherman’s premium, excellent and differentiated brand portfolio, complements the brands in Altria's smokeable products segment.Further, the recent takeover of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BUD  -  Free Report)	 helped Altria to maximize the value of its SABMiller investment. It helped to reward shareholders with an expanded share repurchase program, and improved the company’s position in the global market.However, we believe strict anti-smoking regulations in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties, along with declining cigarette volumes, remain major headwinds.A glimpse of Altria’s stock performance reveals that its shares have been outperforming the broader Zacks categorized Consumer Staples sector since the past one year. The stock rallied 15.9% in comparison with the above mentioned sector’s growth of 6.3%.Stocks to ConsiderAltria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the consumer staple sector is SunOpta, Inc. (STKL  -  Free Report)	, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Altria Positioning Itself Exceptionally Well - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Altria Positioning Itself Exceptionally WellJun.15.17 | About: Altria Group, (MO) Earnings Forecast Focus Long/short equityMarketplaceForecasting EarningsSummaryManagement is making the right decisions to navigate secular headwinds.iQOS approval expected this year.iQOS could be subject to very low cigarette taxes, which would boost margins.Introduction Altria (MO) is somewhat of a dividend darling. The business model as well as the continuously increasing dividend coupled with a decreasing share count offer satisfactory returns. There is one perceived problem: The continued regulatory and social pressure has made Altria’s business model less attractive - so much so that I have seen some declare that the tobacco industry is dead. At least, that is the bear case. While I do contend that the current trends are by no means encouraging, I argue that we must combine secular trends with management decision-making to create a more holistic view.   Put differently, the most important question is: “How is management combating these negative trends?”  IQOS Well, the answer is quite straight forward: They are selling healthy alternatives. And their biggest blockbuster, iQOS, has yet to arrive. Technically speaking, it’s not Altria’s blockbuster - it’s that of Philip Morris (PM). PM has developed a product - a heat stick - that makes smoking substantially less harmful while still providing the nicotine addict with the same feeling and rush. Supposedly, the big secret is heating the tobacco instead of burning it. The heating process releases less toxic products than the traditional cigarette. As an added benefit, the heat stick does not produce any smoke.   Like stated earlier, this is not Altria’s product. However, Altria and Philip Morris used to be one company. I would expect that mutually beneficial relationships still exist. Even if they didn’t exist, it just makes business for PM to wholesale to Altria since PM does not do any business in the US. But, of course, they do exist as Altria has already partnered with Philip Morris in their attempt to seek regulatory authorization to commercialize the product in the United States.   The deal is such that Philip Morris is licensing the iQOS IP to Altria. For perspective, this is the exact same relationship that the companies have regarding e-vapor, except for the fact that with iQOS, the relationship is inverse, meaning that Altria is licensing e-vapor to Philip and Philip is licensing iQOS IP to Altria.   FDA approval One last hurdle that remains before Altria can start selling the IQOS system is the absence of regulatory approval in the United States. The language used in the conference call gives me confidence that the company will be able to secure regulatory approval this year:
  Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLCOn your EPS guidance this year, I just wanted to confirm that it does include any potential expense associated with the commercialization of IQOS this year in terms of any hiring you might need to do, marketing, store openings, et cetera. Thanks.Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc. Yes, it's all in.  Of course, it is far more interesting to know when exactly this will be happening. Management also provides hints regarding the “pace of engagement,” as an analyst eloquently put it.   Tax benefits The answer to his question reveals an interesting, although logical, benefit:  Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, Marty. And on IQOS, are there any updates you can provide on kind of the level of or pace of engagement at the state level as you're talking to legislators about tax treatment, any sense you can give on timeline and your level of confidence that you could potentially align those discussions with the outcome of the FDA's review of pre-market approval? Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.Yeah, that's an interesting question. We are talking to state legislators about the policy issue, of which IQOS is but a part, of having differential taxing, obviously, on lower risk products. That would make good sense. And tax policy gets changed over time, so we're working on that, but I don't have anything new to announce on that.  Notice that the analyst brings up the possibility of a lower tax treatment. If the iQOS tax treatment would be lower equal to the amount of health risk reduction, it would certainly boost margins by a substantial amount. Now, it is obviously hard to quantify the exact amount of risk reduction. Here’s a summary of the benefits for added clarity:  1) Reduced their exposure to 15 harmful chemicals to levels that approached those of smokers who quit smoking; 2) Showed improvements in measured health indicators specific to smoking-related diseases, such as lung and heart disease. In all cases, the health indicators improved in the same direction as seen in smokers who quit. 
 If this proves accurate, and we will have the answer to that by the end of this year, it could reduce the added cigarette tax by approximately 7-090% depending on what “approaches those of smokers who quit smoking” means. According to this page, the latest tax increase increased the price of cigarettes by 13.3% and resulted in a 10.6% decrease in unit sales.  Of course, this is all contingent upon regulatory rationale.   It is hard to argue with certainty that regulators would be OK with this. But, then again, much stranger and more illogical regulatory decisions have been made.   Conclusion  Altria is setting itself up for at least stable revenue in 2018 or 2019. The iQOS will be incredibly helpful in achieving that and probably the main driver. An unexpected upside could be the lowering of additional cigarette taxes, which would boost margins and reduce the amount of heat sticks needed to replace traditional cigarette revenue.

Altria Group: How Long It Survives With Price Increases - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Altria Group: How Long It Survives With Price IncreasesJun.20.17 | About: Altria Group, (MO) New Age Investing Long only, value, Growth, banksSummaryFacing a natural decrease in demand as healthy lifestyles become more fashionable, Altria Group needs to increase its business diversification.Tobacco is a product of utmost importance for smokers, so their demand has low elasticity to price, and the company has the power to increase prices.The current dividend yield does not compensate a potential investor for these business risks, and the stock price growth perspectives are not supported by the underlying financials.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is one of the world's leaders in the manufacturing of tobacco products. Facing a natural decrease in demand as healthy lifestyles become more fashionable, the company needs to increase its business diversification. The main questions to consider for mid- and long-term investors are:  Is the company able to offset a decline in volumes with price increases? Are there any significant positive developments in the product line? Are any M&A activities being undertaken to support margins?  Even though tobacco products consumption is decreasing, especially among youth, MO manages to compensate for the drop in the volume of sales by increasing selling prices. Namely, a 2.6% decline in the volume of smokeable products sales in Q1 2017 was more than offset by price growth so that net revenues from this product segment grew by 0.7% YoY. Existing business is quite efficient with a gross operating margin of roughly 37% in 1Q17 - but that's it, no significant positive developments have been shown recently. The company has been trying to diversify its earnings' sources but didn't manage to decrease the share of tobacco products in sales - it still amounted to 89.7% of net revenues in 1Q17. Only about 10% of revenues were derived from smokeless products and premium wines (the latter is, in addition, a loss-making business segment for now) and no improvement was seen for the last 3 years. Even the e-vapor product category that was booming in 2012-2015 has slowed its growth in the latest quarters. Overall, the company expects to show growth of 8-10% in EPS in FY 2017 with a further increase in selling prices and a decline in volumes.
 So for traditional tobacco manufacturing the light at the end of the tunnel seems quite dim now. Being unable to develop successful new products internally, the company should've been engaging in M&A to diversify its earnings - but we see no such actions. In exchange, MO has 38% of its balance sheet represented by $17.6bn worth 10.2% share in Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). It should be noted that the latest 20-F annual report shows that return on equity of BUD was just about 3.3% in FY2016. At the same time, MO has about $13.9bn of long-term debt outstanding with the average cost of 5.2%. So effectively the company is losing about 2% on this yield-cost difference - and that's $0.3bn per year. The other problem is that almost all these shares are restricted and cannot be sold until October 2021. We can conclude that MO has a significant portion of its assets locked-up in a low-profitable investment which is funded with expensive debt. Quite surprisingly, in April 2017 Fitch Ratings has upgraded MO's credit rating to 'A-' with a 'Stable' outlook. The agency underlined that the increase in rating was attributable to the fact that "fundamental change to litigation risk has occurred due to the settlement and/or dismissal of lawsuits including several class actions during 2016". We think that this ground for rating increase is quite shaky since the company has actually paid less than $1bn of judgments and settlements in the last 10 years. So we believe this rating action should be taken with caution when making investment decisions. Even with all the challenges mentioned above, there's one single reason above all the others to consider MO's business as sustainable at least in the medium term. About 15% of the US population is still actively smoking and MO is responsible more than a half of this market with Marlboro brand having 40-45% of the North American market. Tobacco is a product of utmost importance for the smokers so their demand has low elasticity to price and the company has the power to increase it.
 In terms of stable income, the company has traditionally been generous to shareholders. Dividends paid have been growing at an average rate of 8.5% for the last 3 years and averaged 80-90% of net comprehensive income. However, we believe that the dividend yield which is currently at 3.2% might be quite low for a company with such shaky business perspectives. Apart from dividends, MO is supporting share price with aggressive repurchase program ($1.4bn authorized at end-1Q17) and given the absence of M&A the company is likely to maintain this program in a short term. The stock has a beta of 0.5 only and for the last 12 months it has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 index (+18.9% vs. +17.3% respectively) - so the repurchase program is fulfilling its purpose. To sum up, we believe that given the established franchise and high market share in the US the company will be able to maintain the growth in payouts in near- and medium-term. However, over a longer time horizon, its business perspectives are much vaguer since the demand declines, the price increase has some limitations, and the most important point is that it's not clear how the company is going to diversify its earnings. In our opinion, current dividend yield does not compensate a potential investor for these business risks and stock price growth perspectives not supported by the underlying financials.

History[edit]
Altria emerged from Philip Morris. The onset of "rebranding" of Philip Morris Companies to Altria took place in 2003 (Philip Morris would later split, with PM USA remaining Altria's primary and only consistently held asset). Altria was created because Philip Morris wished to emphasize that its business portfolio had come to consist of more than Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International; at the time, it owned an 84% stake in Kraft,[2] although that business has since been spun off.[3] The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high" and was part of a trend of companies rebranding to names that previously did not exist, Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and Verizon being notable examples,[4] though linguist Steven Pinker suggests that in fact the name is an "egregious example" of phonesthesia — with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".[5]
The company's branding consultants, the Wirthlin Group, said: “The name change alternative offers the possibility of masking the negatives associated with the tobacco business,” thus enabling the company to improve its image and raise its profile without sacrificing tobacco profits.[6]
Philip Morris executives thought a name change would insulate the larger corporation and its other operating companies from the political pressures on tobacco.[6]
The rebranding took place amidst social, legal and financially troubled circumstances.[vague][7] In 2003 Altria was ranked Fortune number 11, and has steadily declined since. In 2010 Altria Group (MO) ranked at Fortune number 137, whereas its former asset, Philip Morris International, was ranked 94th.[8]
In 2006, a United States court found that Philip Morris "publicly ... disputed scientific findings linking smoking and disease knowing their assertions were false." [9]
On March 30, 2007, Altria's 88.1% stake in Kraft Foods Inc was spun off, through a distribution of the remaining stake of shares (88.1%) to Altria shareholders. That same year, Altria began selling all its shares of Philip Morris International to Altria stockholders, a spin off that was completed on March 28, 2008. Again in 2007 the company began the acquisition of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Co. from Bradford Holdings, Inc., which was complete in 2008. After Philip Morris International spun off, the former international subsidiaries halted the purchase of tobacco from America, which was a major factor in the closing of a newly renovated plant in North Carolina, an approximately 50% reduction in manufacturing, large-scale layoffs, and induced early retirements.[10]
In 2008, Altria officially moved its headquarters from New York City to Richmond, Virginia after Philip Morris sold its downtown offices in New York City a decade earlier. With a few exceptions, all manufacturing, commercial, and executive employees had long been based in and around Richmond. Currently the company is headquartered in an unincorporated area within Henrico County, less than five miles west of the city limits of Richmond and less than ten miles from its downtown Richmond campus.
Aside from the Philip Morris/Altria headquarters, some of their other buildings included the Philip Morris Center for Research and Technology in downtown Richmond, their manufacturing center in South Richmond, and the adjacent operations center which began shutting down in 2007-2008, as a result of the loss of demand from PMI member companies. The layoffs beginning in 2007 affected thousands of Altria, Altria Client Services, Philip Morris USA, and contracted employees in Richmond and North Carolina.
In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates).[11] This ended a short era of competition between the new Marlboro smokeless tobacco products such as snus, and those produced by UST Inc.
Corporate governance[edit]
Board of directors[edit]
Members of the board of directors of Altria Group as/of February 2013 were:[12]

Nabil Y. Sakkab (2008– ), retired SVP, corporate research and development, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH

Headquarters[edit]
Prior to being based in Virginia, Philip Morris had its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[13] In 2003, Philip Morris announced that it would move its headquarters to Virginia. The company said that it planned to keep around 750 employees in its former headquarters. Brendan McCormick, a spokesperson for Philip Morris, said that the company estimated that the move would save the company over $60 million each year.[14] The company now has its head offices in an unincorporated area of Henrico County, Virginia, in Richmond.[15] In addition, the company has a 450,000-square-foot, $350 million Center for Research and Technology located in downtown Richmond at the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park that employs approximately 600 scientists, engineers and support staff.
Political influence[edit]
According to the Center for Public Integrity, Altria spent around $101 million on lobbying the United States government between 1998 and 2004, making it the second most active organization in the nation.[16][17]
Altria also funded The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition which lobbied against the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.[18]
Daniel Smith, representing Altria, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[19]

On January 6, 2009, Altria acquired UST Inc., a smokeless tobacco manufacturer, which also owned wine producer Ste Michelle Wine Estates, and is now a subsidiary of Altria.

History[edit]
Altria emerged from Philip Morris. The onset of "rebranding" of Philip Morris Companies to Altria took place in 2003 (Philip Morris would later split, with PM USA remaining Altria's primary and only consistently held asset). Altria was created because Philip Morris wished to emphasize that its business portfolio had come to consist of more than Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International; at the time, it owned an 84% stake in Kraft,[2] although that business has since been spun off.[3] The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high" and was part of a trend of companies rebranding to names that previously did not exist, Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and Verizon being notable examples,[4] though linguist Steven Pinker suggests that in fact the name is an "egregious example" of phonesthesia — with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".[5]
The company's branding consultants, the Wirthlin Group, said: “The name change alternative offers the possibility of masking the negatives associated with the tobacco business,” thus enabling the company to improve its image and raise its profile without sacrificing tobacco profits.[6]
Philip Morris executives thought a name change would insulate the larger corporation and its other operating companies from the political pressures on tobacco.[6]
The rebranding took place amidst social, legal and financially troubled circumstances.[vague][7] In 2003 Altria was ranked Fortune number 11, and has steadily declined since. In 2010 Altria Group (MO) ranked at Fortune number 137, whereas its former asset, Philip Morris International, was ranked 94th.[8]
In 2006, a United States court found that Philip Morris "publicly ... disputed scientific findings linking smoking and disease knowing their assertions were false." [9]
On March 30, 2007, Altria's 88.1% stake in Kraft Foods Inc was spun off, through a distribution of the remaining stake of shares (88.1%) to Altria shareholders. That same year, Altria began selling all its shares of Philip Morris International to Altria stockholders, a spin off that was completed on March 28, 2008. Again in 2007 the company began the acquisition of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Co. from Bradford Holdings, Inc., which was complete in 2008. After Philip Morris International spun off, the former international subsidiaries halted the purchase of tobacco from America, which was a major factor in the closing of a newly renovated plant in North Carolina, an approximately 50% reduction in manufacturing, large-scale layoffs, and induced early retirements.[10]
In 2008, Altria officially moved its headquarters from New York City to Richmond, Virginia after Philip Morris sold its downtown offices in New York City a decade earlier. With a few exceptions, all manufacturing, commercial, and executive employees had long been based in and around Richmond. Currently the company is headquartered in an unincorporated area within Henrico County, less than five miles west of the city limits of Richmond and less than ten miles from its downtown Richmond campus.
Aside from the Philip Morris/Altria headquarters, some of their other buildings included the Philip Morris Center for Research and Technology in downtown Richmond, their manufacturing center in South Richmond, and the adjacent operations center which began shutting down in 2007-2008, as a result of the loss of demand from PMI member companies. The layoffs beginning in 2007 affected thousands of Altria, Altria Client Services, Philip Morris USA, and contracted employees in Richmond and North Carolina.
In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates).[11] This ended a short era of competition between the new Marlboro smokeless tobacco products such as snus, and those produced by UST Inc.
Corporate governance[edit]

Members of the board of directors of Altria Group as/of February 2013 were:[12]

Headquarters[edit]
Prior to being based in Virginia, Philip Morris had its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[13] In 2003, Philip Morris announced that it would move its headquarters to Virginia. The company said that it planned to keep around 750 employees in its former headquarters. Brendan McCormick, a spokesperson for Philip Morris, said that the company estimated that the move would save the company over $60 million each year.[14] The company now has its head offices in an unincorporated area of Henrico County, Virginia, in Richmond.[15] In addition, the company has a 450,000-square-foot, $350 million Center for Research and Technology located in downtown Richmond at the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park that employs approximately 600 scientists, engineers and support staff.
Political influence[edit]
According to the Center for Public Integrity, Altria spent around $101 million on lobbying the United States government between 1998 and 2004, making it the second most active organization in the nation.[16][17]
Altria also funded The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition which lobbied against the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.[18]
Daniel Smith, representing Altria, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[19]

Altria Group, Inc. (renamed from Philip Morris Companies Inc. on January 27, 2003) is an American corporation and one of the world's largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes and related products. It operates worldwide and is headquartered in Henrico County, Virginia.
Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA, John Middleton, Inc., U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, Inc., Philip Morris Capital Corporation, and Chateau Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. Philip Morris International was spun off in 2008. Altria maintains a 28.7% stake in the UK-based brewer SABMiller plc. It is a component of the S&P 500 and was a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average until February 19, 2008. On January 6, 2009, Altria acquired UST Inc., a smokeless tobacco manufacturer, which also owned wine producer Ste Michelle Wine Estates, and is now a subsidiary of Altria.

History[edit]
Altria emerged from Philip Morris. The onset of "rebranding" of Philip Morris Companies to Altria took place in 2003 (Philip Morris would later split, with PM USA remaining Altria's primary and only consistently held asset). Altria was created because Philip Morris wished to emphasize that its business portfolio had come to consist of more than Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International; at the time, it owned an 84% stake in Kraft,[2] although that business has since been spun off.[3] The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high" and was part of a trend of companies rebranding to names that previously did not exist, Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and Verizon being notable examples,[4] though linguist Steven Pinker suggests that in fact the name is an "egregious example" of phonesthesia — with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".[5]
The company's branding consultants, the Wirthlin Group, said: “The name change alternative offers the possibility of masking the negatives associated with the tobacco business,” thus enabling the company to improve its image and raise its profile without sacrificing tobacco profits.[6]
Philip Morris executives thought a name change would insulate the larger corporation and its other operating companies from the political pressures on tobacco.[6]
The rebranding took place amidst social, legal and financially troubled circumstances.[vague][7] In 2003 Altria was ranked Fortune number 11, and has steadily declined since. In 2010 Altria Group (MO) ranked at Fortune number 137, whereas its former asset, Philip Morris International, was ranked 94th.[8]
In 2006, a United States court found that Philip Morris "publicly ... disputed scientific findings linking smoking and disease knowing their assertions were false." [9]
On March 30, 2007, Altria's 88.1% stake in Kraft Foods Inc was spun off, through a distribution of the remaining stake of shares (88.1%) to Altria shareholders. That same year, Altria began selling all its shares of Philip Morris International to Altria stockholders, a spin off that was completed on March 28, 2008. Again in 2007 the company began the acquisition of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Co. from Bradford Holdings, Inc., which was complete in 2008. After Philip Morris International spun off, the former international subsidiaries halted the purchase of tobacco from America, which was a major factor in the closing of a newly renovated plant in North Carolina, an approximately 50% reduction in manufacturing, large-scale layoffs, and induced early retirements.[10]
In 2008, Altria officially moved its headquarters from New York City to Richmond, Virginia after Philip Morris sold its downtown offices in New York City a decade earlier. With a few exceptions, all manufacturing, commercial, and executive employees had long been based in and around Richmond. Currently the company is headquartered in an unincorporated area within Henrico County, less than five miles west of the city limits of Richmond and less than ten miles from its downtown Richmond campus.
Aside from the Philip Morris/Altria headquarters, some of their other buildings included the Philip Morris Center for Research and Technology in downtown Richmond, their manufacturing center in South Richmond, and the adjacent operations center which began shutting down in 2007-2008, as a result of the loss of demand from PMI member companies. The layoffs beginning in 2007 affected thousands of Altria, Altria Client Services, Philip Morris USA, and contracted employees in Richmond and North Carolina.
In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates).[11] This ended a short era of competition between the new Marlboro smokeless tobacco products such as snus, and those produced by UST Inc.

Headquarters[edit]
Prior to being based in Virginia, Philip Morris had its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[13] In 2003, Philip Morris announced that it would move its headquarters to Virginia. The company said that it planned to keep around 750 employees in its former headquarters. Brendan McCormick, a spokesperson for Philip Morris, said that the company estimated that the move would save the company over $60 million each year.[14] The company now has its head offices in an unincorporated area of Henrico County, Virginia, in Richmond.[15] In addition, the company has a 450,000-square-foot, $350 million Center for Research and Technology located in downtown Richmond at the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park that employs approximately 600 scientists, engineers and support staff.
Political influence[edit]
According to the Center for Public Integrity, Altria spent around $101 million on lobbying the United States government between 1998 and 2004, making it the second most active organization in the nation.[16][17]
Altria also funded The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition which lobbied against the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.[18]
Daniel Smith, representing Altria, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[19]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
