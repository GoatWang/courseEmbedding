Kid Rock Ends Custody Battle

After a 10-month custody battle, Kid Rock — real name Robert Ritchie — has decided to let his ex-girlfriend, Kelley South Russell, spend more time with their 7-year-old son, Robert Ritchie Jr. And he's only charging her $25 per week for the privilege. Well, there went your Father's Day present!

As part of a settlement deal reached Tuesday, Russell, who is an autoworker for Ford Motor Co., will pay the multiplatinum "hick-hop" star $25 per week in child support in exchange for being allowed to spend more time with their progeny. That amount is halved to $12.50 if Rob Jr. spends six days or more in a row in his mother's custody.

"He was absolutely, positively insistent that she pay child support," Russell's attorney, Kathy Vogt, told the Detroit Free Press Wednesday. "His position is that she needs to assume responsibility." But that's not how Vogt sees it. "My opinion is this is punishment," she added.

Under the new agreement, Russell will also provide for their son's health insurance. "It's not a matter of he can't afford it — he can — but why pay for something you don't have to?" noted Vogt.

Although Kid Rock has had permanent custody of the child for the past five years, in July, the couple was back in court, after Russell alleged that the star had prevented her from spending summer vacation time with the boy. Rock said he refused Russell's request because it came less than 30 days beforehand, as required by a previous agreement, and their son was already enrolled in summer day camp.

In January, South, claiming that Kid Rock's rising popularity prevented him from spending sufficient time with their son, filed motions to regain custody of the child, even though a 1995 investigation disclosed that she had a drinking problem and had once stabbed the rapper in the leg with a knife. Last month, the Macomb County Friend of the Court recommended that Kid Rock retain full custody of the boy.

Although Russell and the rap star were never married, a 1994 paternity suit revealed that Kid Rock was the youngster's biological father.

            Kid Rock To Be A Grandfather!                    
Glenn Brock



Kid Rock is known as many things. Add ‘grandfather’ to the list.
Rock, real name Robert James Ritchie, 43, will be a grandpa to a little girl born to his son, Bobby Ritchie, Jr. and his girlfriend, US Weekly has reported. Rock’s son goes by his stage name of Robert James. It has been learned that the couple are four months along, and all are currently doing well.
Kid Rock’s people had no comment on the pregnancy at this time.
Kid Rock welcomed his son along with then-girlfriend Kelley South Russell in 1993. In 2000, Rock won a custody battle with Russell, raising his son almost entirely on his own. He did convince the court that Russell should pay $25 a week in child support.
Rock admits he made some mistakes along the way raising his son, but was equally proud of being a father, so long as that didn’t taint the “Cowboy” stage presence. “Make no mistake,” Rock joked to Esquire in 2011, “Bob Ritchie’s up early in the morning taking pictures of his son on the first day of his senior year. Kid Rock is passed out in a hotel room somewhere with four scantily clad women,” reports Popcrush.
“(Not taking care of my son) didn’t seem like an option. Who would do that? It might have something to do with my upbringing. Thanks mom!”
Russell, in turn, sued Rock for Defamation of Character over a song he wrote in 1998 about their romance, entitled “Black Chick, White Guy.”
In 2006, Rock married Pamela Anderson, but filed for divorce a mere 5 months later, reportedly because Anderson bad-mouthed Rock’s mother and sister in front of his son. According to SheKnows, talking to Howard Stern about his divorce, the rocker said, “[The relationship] started to affect my son, when it started to affect my son, I was like ‘I’m out.’ It took me a minute, but thank God I did.”
The Daily Mail reports the soon-to-be grandpa will be touring soon. Kid’s next tour date is August 23 in St Paul, Minnesota.
Soon after the child is born, Kid will be hosting a cruise. The Kid Rock’s Sixth Annual Chillin’ The Most Cruise will take place from March 2 to 6 on the Norwegian Pearl from Miami to Cozumel. The cruise included performances, guest stars (the band Date Night) and theme nights.
In addition to Pamela – who he married in 2006 but divorced five months later – and Kelley South Russell, the Rebel Soul singer has also dated Jaime King, Sheryl Crow, Jesse Jane, Jaime Pressly, Briana Banks, Tamara Mellon, Paris Hilton, May Anderson, Alyssa Lipsky and Kellie Pickler.
