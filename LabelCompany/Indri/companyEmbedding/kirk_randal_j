Early life and education[edit]
Randal J. Kirk was born in Pleasanton, California.[8] The son of an U.S. Air Force master sergeant,[9] Kirk and his family moved from California to Texas before settling in Virginia.[8] Kirk graduated from Dublin High School in Pulaski County, Virginia.[6] Following high school, Kirk worked selling cars and motorcycles, and enrolled part-time at Radford University to study business.[6] He earned a bachelor's degree in Economics at Radford in 1976, followed by a Juris Doctor at the University of Virginia in 1979.[7]
Career[edit]
Kirk was admitted to the bar in 1980, becoming the only attorney in Bland, Virginia, and began a practice he ran until 1990.[2][8][3] In 1983, he partnered with Bland County pharmacist John Gregory to found the next-day pharmaceutical distributor General Injectables and Vaccines. Kirk and his partners would go on to sell the business to Henry Schein, Inc. for $65 million in 1998.[9][10][11]
In 1996, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals, where he served as chairman and CEO and took the company public in 2004.[12][13] The developer of attention-deficit drug Vyvanse, New River would prove to be Kirk's single biggest payoff when he sold the company to Shire in 2007 for $2.6 billion, making over a $1 billion for Kirk himself.[2][14]
In 1999, Kirk founded the life-sciences investment firm Third Security, LLC, where he is senior managing director, CEO and chairman.[15][16] From 2000 to 2002, Kirk served as a member of the board of directors for Scios, Inc., a maker of heart disease medication that later sold to Johnson & Johnson for $2.4 billion.[17][18] Kirk also became the majority stock holder and chairman of Newton, Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company Clinical Data, Inc. In 2011, shortly after Clinical Data's drug Viibryd received regulatory approval, Forest Laboratories bought Clinical Data for $1.2 billion.[19]
Kirk became involved with biotechnology company Intrexon in the 2000s. He was named chairman of its board in 2008 and became CEO in 2009.[20] Kirk took Intrexon public in 2013, taking the company's market cap to $2.5 billion with the IPO.[21]
Kirk is involved in a number of companies advocating the approval of genetically-altered animals, including salmon (through AquaBounty),[22] disease-resistant mosquitoes (through Oxitec),[23] and an apple which resists browning (through Okanagan Specialty Fruits).[24] Other projects of Kirk's companies include creating cancer treatments, gasoline substitutes, crop protection, and improving bovine genetics.[2][25][26]
Recognition[edit]
Kirk has been profiled by SynBioBeta and Forbes.[27][28] In 2008, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine named Kirk Virginia’s Outstanding Industrialist for the Year.[29] He has spoken at the SynBioBeta Conference,[27] BioFlorida,[30] Klick Ideas Exchange[31] and was a Borlaug Dialogue Speaker at the World Food Prize.[32]
Philanthropy and other roles[edit]
Following the sale of General Injectables and Vaccines, Kirk donated $1 million to Radford University, creating the Zylphia Shu-En Kirk Endowment[6] named after his daughter.[3] Kirk has served on the board of directors of the Radford University Foundation and the school's board of visitors.[6] Kirk was a member of University of Virginia's board of visitors from 2009 to 2012.[33]
Kirk has also donated substantially to political causes. He considers himself a political independent, and has supported both Republicans and Democrats.[34] He has been especially involved in Virginia politics, donating $1.8 million to candidates for state office, including $200,000 to Terry McAuliffe's 2009 Virginia gubernatorial election.[35] [36] Since 1994 he has donated $183,250 in federal elections.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Kirk lives in West Palm Beach, Florida and has four children.[2] According to Forbes, Kirk is worth $3.3 billion and ranks No. 174 on its Forbes 400 list.[4] Kirk's hobbies include falconry.[38]

Career[edit]
Kirk was admitted to the bar in 1980, becoming the only attorney in Bland, Virginia, and began a practice he ran until 1990.[2][8][3] In 1983, he partnered with Bland County pharmacist John Gregory to found the next-day pharmaceutical distributor General Injectables and Vaccines. Kirk and his partners would go on to sell the business to Henry Schein, Inc. for $65 million in 1998.[9][10][11]
In 1996, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals, where he served as chairman and CEO and took the company public in 2004.[12][13] The developer of attention-deficit drug Vyvanse, New River would prove to be Kirk's single biggest payoff when he sold the company to Shire in 2007 for $2.6 billion, making over a $1 billion for Kirk himself.[2][14]

Following The Smart Money: The Small Cap Biotech Investments Of Randal J. Kirk | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Following The Smart Money: The Small Cap Biotech Investments Of Randal J. KirkMar. 11, 2014  8:30 AM ET|| Includes: FCSC, HALO, SYN, XON, ZIOPby: StockMatusowStockMatusow Long/short equity, Deep Value, value, research analystStockmatusowSummaryOne of the most tried and true forms of picking the right kind of developmental biotech investment is following those who have success in investing in them.The most successful small cap biotech investors understand that those with a top track record of success tend to repeat this same pattern of success over and over.Randal J. Kirk has a solid record of successful investments in developmental biotech companies. Today, we will look at some of his current investments, and offer commentary on them.Many might not be familiar with who Randal J. Kirk is, but he is an influential man in the small cap biotech investment world. He got his start in business in the early 1980's and is now Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (NYSE:CEO) of Intrexon (XON). In 1983, Kirk founded General Injectables and Vaccines (GIV). GIV is a privately held company that essentially acts as a next day supplier of medical products for various outlets. In 1998, Kirk and his ownership team sold GIV to Henry Schein, Inc. for approximately $65M.
Aferwards, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, and took the company public in 2004. Not long after taking the company public, New River received Food and Drug Admininstration (FDA) approval for Vyvanse, an attention deficit disorder treatment, in 2007. Not long after this approval, Kirk sold the company and his 50% stake to Shire plc for $2.6B.
In 1999, Kirk turned his attention to venture capitalism, and founded Third Security, LLC, which invests in start-up developmental biotech companies. It's through Third Security LLC that Kirk currently invests in small cap developmental companies.
One of Kirk's most successful investments over the last year has been Halozyme (HALO). In 2013, Halozyme was trading around $5, and less than a year later the stock currently trades around $14, which represents well over a 200% gain. Much of the buzz and potential with Halozyme is around its proprietary Enhaze technology.
Enhaze technology consists of a recombinant enzyme called Hylenex (rHuPH20). It enables better absorption of existing drugs into the body subcutaneously.

Halozyme is developing PEGPH20 (NYSE:PEG), which is a PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase form of Hylenex in combination with gemcitabine (chemotherapy) for the treatment of patients with stage IV metastatic pancreatic cancer. Positive results were released at ASCO in June of last year pertaining to the Phase Ib trial studying PEGPH20/gemcitabine.
We are most excited about PEG as its potential is virtually limitless in our opinion. If successful, PEG can treat cancers that are currently considered untreatable, and provide the hope to patients diagnosed with such cancers that their diagnosis is not an automatic death sentence.
PEG is designed to target cancers that contain high levels of hyaluronan (NASDAQ:HA), such as for an example, Pancreatic cancer. Hyaluronan obstructs the blood vessels in a tumor which makes nearly impossible for current treatments to be delivered into these tumors. In simpler terms, Halozyme believes it will show in clinical testing that PEG opens up these obstructed blood vessels which will allow treatments and therapies to target what are now untreatable cancerous tumors.
Kirk has gained a lot of positive attention from his investment in Halozyme, as Third Security LLC owns 19,791,286, with Kirk owning 3,480,000 shares directly, which represents over 20% ownership in Halozyme. We think Kirk's investment in Halozyme will pay off in huge way if PEG ultimately proves to be successful. However, we feel it's a good possibility the company will be acquired long before the final verdict on PEG materializes.
Intrexon, the company where Kirk is Chairman of the board and CEO, has seen a stock increase from $17.52 to $38.50 year over year, and currently trades near $27.
Intrexon specializes in the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology focuses on synthesizing life on a cellular basis, and seeks to use this synthesis to potentially discover new ways to benefit society as a whole.
Such examples of this include DNA sequencing, fabrication of genes, and gene modeling. Intrexon's platform in part, aims to repair/replace defective genes with functioning genes to more effectively treat and potentially cure a broad range of diseases.

Intrexon's top developmental technology is called RheoSwitch. RheoSwitch is a gene switch activated by a small molecule ligand which can be used to regulate the timing, location, and concentration of gene expression with potential applications in human, animal, and plant systems. The RheoSwitch technology is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials for melanoma and breast cancer.
In Layman's terms, RheoSwitch is designed to more effectively time and deliver small molecules, ions, and/or proteins when and where needed (Ligand administration). RheoSwitch could allow drug developers and physicians the ability to control the levels and timing of these small molecules, ions, and/or proteins in certain drugs and therapies more accurately. Basically, RheoSwitch aims to help make existing drugs and therapies more precise, effective, and safer.
If proven successful in clinical trials, RheoSwitch has the potential to be a big money maker for the company.
Third Security LLC owns 62,196,272 shares of Intrexon, representing the number one holding for Kirk's company, and nearly 65% ownership of Intrexon. Intrexon has multiple partnerships with other companies that Kirk holds through Third Security, some of them mentioned here.
Intrexon is certainly engaging in very interesting and cutting edge technology with high potential. With 62M shares held by Kirk's Third Security, if in fact the Intrexon's platform finds success, Kirk will be hitting yet another stock jackpot.
Synthetic Biologics Inc. (SYN) is a company Kirk's Third Security also holds a large position in with an important data release coming in April of this year. The company is scheduled to present this week at the 26th Annual ROTH Conference on Tuesday, March 11, 2014.
The top line data release will be from Synthetic's evaluation of Trimesta (oral estriol) in combination with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (NYSE:MS) in women. Synthetics holds the patent license to the Trimesta/Copaxone combination.

We found an interesting write up that seems make a connection between women who use oral contraceptives (birth control pills) for an extended period of time and the possible onset of MS symptoms, and even a higher risk for those who stop taking the pills. This is interesting because birth control pills use estradiol and estrone, along with progesterone, yet contain very little estriol -- all of these are different forms of the hormone estrogen. Estriol has been said to give relief to women from MS symptoms while pregnant.
We think this bodes well for Synthetic's Phase II trial mentioned above to produce positive results as estriol accounts for 60 to 80% of circulating estrogen, which is what these women might lack after discontinuing their use of birth control. MS is a rare disease, and birth control pills have not been shown to be conclusively connected to the onset of MS, but studies show it could be.
Synthetic is also developing a beta-lactamase enzyme (SYN-004) to target the prevention of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile or C. diff) infections.
The company aims to show that when co-administered with certain intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics, SYN-004 can degrade the antibiotic that is excreted in the gastrointestinal (NYSE:GI) tract. Additionally, the company believes that SYN-004 will be able to degrade a broader spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics, including both penicillin's and cephalosporin's.
In 2012, 15 million Americans were administered beta-lactam antibiotics. This bodes well for companies developing a drug like SYN-004, as President Obama is proposing to double spending on these types of drugs in the future.
Synthetics, with a market cap of around $150M, is the only company we can find that is developing a C. difficile drug with a market cap under $500M.
Kirk's Third Security LLC owns 12,300,768 shares of Synthetic, which represents nearly 25% of the company. It's also interesting to note that Michael Dell's affiliate investment adviser firm MSDC Management, LP, owns 2,675,000 shares in Synthetics.

Synthetics could pay off nicely for Kirk and Dell's affiliate investment firm in time, especially if the near-term data release shows to be successful in April, and it's our opinion that the data will be positive.
Kirk also owns a large position in Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP). Ziopharm is employing novel gene expression and control technology to deliver DNA for the treatment of cancer. Its technology platform employs Intrexon Corporation's RheoSwitch Therapeutic System platform to turn on and off, and modulate gene expression at the cancer site in order to improve the therapeutic index.
Last March, the company experienced a significant setback when its lead drug Palifosfamide, failed to show any statistically significant improvement in progression free survival in soft tissue sarcoma. However, Ziopharm seems to be back on track with its Ad-RTS-IL-12, which is a novel DNA-based therapeutic candidate that is being evaluated with the oral activator veledimex, in patients with advanced melanoma.
In December of last year, Ziopharm reported positive interim results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 melanoma study which showed good safety and tolerability. Additionally, in December of last year Ziopharm initiated a Phase 1 study of Ad-RTS-IL-12 in subjects with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma or grade III malignant glioma (brain cancer).
Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor "Chemistfrog" explains this treatment in an article from June, 2013;
Ad-RTS IL-12, employs the use of an adenoviral vector to deliver into patients' cells the IL-12 DNA plasmid instructing the cells to produce the IL-12 cytokine.
Interleukin-12 is a protein (cytokine) known to trigger an immune response to cancer.
Cyotines are very important in the immune system as they modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses, and they regulate the maturation, growth, and responsiveness of particular cell populations.
Interestingly enough, Ziopharm licenses Ad-RTS IL-12 from Intrexon, Kirk's largest investment to date. If Ad-RTS IL-12 ultimately proves to be a success, Kirk will be rolling in the money in a big way.

Kirk's Third Security LLC owns 17,815,708 shares of Ziopharm, which represents a little over 26% of the company.
Fibrocell Science, Inc. (FCSC) is another company Kirk and his company owns a good amount of shares in. Fibrocell's flagship product is LAVIV, a personalized and FDA approved aesthetic cell therapy for the improvement of smile line wrinkles in adults.
The company is also engaging in various clinical and pre-clinical programs which include treatments for restrictive burn scars, vocal cord scars, and acne scars.
Fibrocell's platform includes using a patient's own skin cells in order to produce collagen lost through trauma or natural aging process. The company also develops Fibrocell Science Autologous Crème, a cell transplantation skin care cream.
Randal Kirk seems to do a nice job leveraging his assets in a way that is beneficial to all of the companies he has interest in. Fabrocell is partnered with Intrexon Corporation, where as previously mentioned, Kirk is Chairman and CEO. In January of this year, this relationship was expanded in order to develop a treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type (EDS-HT), a rare genetic disorder resulting in weakened connective tissue.
Fibrocell and Intrexon will endeavor to engineer autologous fibroblast cells genetically corrected to produce tenascin-X (TN-X), a protein that is deficient in the connective tissue of a subset of EDS-HT patients. Patients with EDS-HT often experience significant musculoskeletal complications, including frequent joint dislocations, subluxations and early onset osteoarthritis.
Fibroblast is a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen, and are the most common cells in connective tissue.
In Layman's terms, Fibroblast synthesizes a reaction outside a damaged cell, activating structural and biochemical support outside the plasma membranes, causing the cell to repair itself after injury.
Kirk's Third Security LLC owns 14,219,837 of Fibrocell's stock, or about $80 million worth. Important clinical results from an ongoing Phase II trial in the burn contracture setting are expected in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the Phase II trial in the vocal cord scarring setting is also expected to release top-line data in Q1, 2015

We can see Kirk appears to invest in companies with potential cutting edge technology. His investment in Intrexon seems to be supportive of the other companies mentioned here that he has also invested in.
We like to follow successful money, and Randall Kirk has proven himself over time as being a successful investor in these types of companies, similar to how the Baker Brothers LLC has had top success in the developmental biotech space.
Technology always advances, and we believe the companies we mention here have the potential for major break-thru in this advancement -- obviously, so does Randall Kirk.

 A Legendary Biotech Investor Just Spent $14 Million on this Stock 
 



 


Tuesday, April 17, 2012 - 11:30am
by David Sterman








 
 Randal J. Kirk is beside himself right now. The legendary biotech investor, who is now worth more than $2 billion, made a rare misstep by plunking down $14 million (at $10.61 a share) on Halozyme Therapeutics (Nasdaq: HALO) in February, only to see that investment lose a quarter of its value on Monday, April 16.

 
His nearly 8% stake in the company is now worth roughly $70 million, down from nearly $100 million before Monday's plunge. That's when the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) told Halozyme -- along with key partner Baxter (NYSE: BAX) -- that further clinical testing for a key drug would be required.
This put an abrupt end to a solid upward move in the stock, which only recently saw the company's value move past the $1 billion mark. But Kirk figures to still profit handsomely, as Halozyme's biotechnology platform should still reap solid rewards in the years to come. 






Halozyme has been garnering a steadily rising buzz in biotech circles, thanks to the impressive action of its key product, hyalurodinase. The drug mimics hyoluric acid, which is naturally produced by the body as a gel-like substance. Halozyme's hyalurodinase has proven quite effective at helping drugs to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Baxter and Roche Holdings (Pink Sheets: RHBBY) have poured money into Halozyme in exchange for the rights to market several drugs that are currently before the FDA. In both instances, those two Big Pharma players want to use hyalurodinase to convert existing intravenous (IV) drugs into subcutaneous (injectable) drugs.
Roche, for example, has paired up Halozyme's drug with its own Herceptin and Rituxan drugs, both of which are seen as key parts of Roche's future sales growth. Analysts at Brean Murray have repeatedly suggested that Roche might look to buy Halozyme (at around $13 a share) if the FDA issues a full set of green lights for the drug combinations. (Shares had been surging in recent months on news that clinical trials pairing hyaluronidase with other drugs were going very well.) 
Biotech investors first began chatting about Halozyme in late 2010 when the company brought in a new business development team that subsequently initiated several new key partnerships. In June 2011, Halozyme signed a development deal with privately-held Intrexon to develop a subcutaneous version of A1AT, a protease inhibitor used to stop inflammation in respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and emphysema. 
A partnership with Viropharma (Nasdaq: VPHM) was also launched, and clinical tests are now underway for pairing hyalurodinase and Viropharma's Cinryze, which treats a fairly obscure genetic blood disease.
These partnerships are being pursued in tandem with Halozyme's own proprietary drug-development efforts. For example, the company recently announced solid Phase I testing data for HTI-501, which treats extreme cellulite. The opportunity in the cosmetic market possibly holds even higher potential than Halozyme's multiple partnerships. Lastly, Halozyme is also developing PEGPH20 to treat pancreatic cancer, and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) is looking at using it in tandem with its gemcitabine drug, which is used in chemotherapy.
Parsing the FDA's response
So does the FDA's move to ask Baxter and Halozyme to submit more long-term data render hyalurodinase much less worthwhile? Not at all. To be sure, a possible 2012 product launch is now unlikely to happen, and conservative investors may wish to assume that that the Baxter/Halozyme drug, known as HyQ, won't get approved at all. Analysts at Goldman Sachs still think HyQ will get approved, though that may come as late as 2014 if a new clinical trial is required.
Here's the key takeaway: The FDA has not cast doubt on HyQ, but says the companies should be providing more long-term clinical-testing data. So shares were dumped on Monday because Halozyme's expected revenue ramp will be pushed out by at least several quarters. And as is the case with many biotech stocks, this quickly leads to concerns about financial strength while the move to profitability is delayed. 
Halozyme was fortunate to raise roughly $80 million in February (which is when Randal Kirk bought his shares). The company now has an estimated $120 million in the bank, which is likely sufficient to fund operations for another 12-18 months. In the interim, the company may also receive royalty payments from other partners as key drugs advance in the clinical testing process. 
Taking account of the FDA setback, analysts at Brean Murray lowered their target price from $13 to $11, although some biotech investors, including Randal Kirk, presumably believe Halozyme's biotechnology platform could be worth much more than that. 
Risks to Consider: Halozyme is expected to report a range of other clinical-testing information in the coming 12 months and will need to show continued positive results before shares can rebound.
Action to Take--> This is all about risk and reward. Monday's setback has removed much of the near-term risk from the stock. Shares may simply tread water in the absence of near-term catalysts. But shares would quickly spike well north of $10 again if the cellulite drug opportunity starts to heat up, or if Roche's marketing efforts start to pay off and Halozyme starts to report an impressive sales ramp. 
As is the case with any biotech stock, investors should only accord a smaller portion of funds to this speculative type of business model. But Monday's sell-off looks like a great opportunity to step in as other investors step away.

In a just published Form 13, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Soligenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNGX) reported that Kirk Randal J has picked up 277,631 of common stock as of 2017-06-16.
The acquisition brings the aggregate amount owned by Kirk Randal J to a total of 277,631 representing a 4.9% stake in the company.
For those not familiar with the company, Soligenix, Inc. is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need. Soligenix has two areas of focus: 1) a therapeutics segment dedicated to the development of products for orphan diseases and areas of unmet medical need such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, oral mucositis, pediatric Crohn’s disease, acute radiation enteritis, and 2) a vaccines/biodefense segment to develop vaccines and therapeutics for military and civilian applications in the areas of ricin exposure, gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome, and melioidosis.
A glance at Soligenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNGX)’s key stats reveals a current market capitalization of $13.19 Million based on $3.80 Million shares outstanding and a price at last close of $2.02 per share.
Looking at insider activity, there are a few transactions worth noting.
Specifically, on 2016-12-16, Schaber picked up 15,804 at a purchase price of $3.16. This brings their total holding to 25,095 as of the date of the filing.
On the sell side, the most recent transaction saw Kirk unload 1,881 shares at a sale price of $2.54. This brings their total holding to 85,397.
It’s possible to gauge a company’s potential by tracking the activity of its major holders, as well as checking in on insider activity such as those transactions listed above. We’ll be keeping an Soligenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNGX) as things move forward to see if its progress aligns with these transactions.

Job Details
               New River Pharmaceuticals Inc.

We are developing new molecular entities that are derivatives of public domain actives using our proprietary Carrierwave™ technology. Our lead product candidates in clinical development are an amphetamine derivative (NDA filed) and an opioid derivative that we believe will provide improved alternatives to currently marketed drugs. In preclinical development, we are researching a drug for the treatment of chronic pain, which we believe could reduce the development of opioid tolerance, and a drug for the treatment of primary hypothyroidism.

Early life and education[edit]
Randal J. Kirk was born in Pleasanton, California.[8] The son of an U.S. Air Force master sergeant,[9] Kirk and his family moved from California to Texas before settling in Virginia.[8] Kirk graduated from Dublin High School in Pulaski County, Virginia.[6] Following high school, Kirk worked selling cars and motorcycles, and enrolled part-time at Radford University to study business.[6] He earned a bachelor's degree in Economics at Radford in 1976, followed by a Juris Doctor at the University of Virginia in 1979.[7]
Career[edit]
Kirk was admitted to the bar in 1980, becoming the only attorney in Bland, Virginia, and began a practice he ran until 1990.[2][8][3] In 1983, he partnered with Bland County pharmacist John Gregory to found the next-day pharmaceutical distributor General Injectables and Vaccines. Kirk and his partners would go on to sell the business to Henry Schein, Inc. for $65 million in 1998.[9][10][11]
In 1996, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals, where he served as chairman and CEO and took the company public in 2004.[12][13] The developer of attention-deficit drug Vyvanse, New River would prove to be Kirk's single biggest payoff when he sold the company to Shire in 2007 for $2.6 billion, making over a $1 billion for Kirk himself.[2][14]
In 1999, Kirk founded the life-sciences investment firm Third Security, LLC, where he is senior managing director, CEO and chairman.[15][16] From 2000 to 2002, Kirk served as a member of the board of directors for Scios, Inc., a maker of heart disease medication that later sold to Johnson & Johnson for $2.4 billion.[17][18] Kirk also became the majority stock holder and chairman of Newton, Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company Clinical Data, Inc. In 2011, shortly after Clinical Data's drug Viibryd received regulatory approval, Forest Laboratories bought Clinical Data for $1.2 billion.[19]
Kirk became involved with biotechnology company Intrexon in the 2000s. He was named chairman of its board in 2008 and became CEO in 2009.[20] Kirk took Intrexon public in 2013, taking the company's market cap to $2.5 billion with the IPO.[21]
Kirk is involved in a number of companies advocating the approval of genetically-altered animals, including salmon (through AquaBounty),[22] disease-resistant mosquitoes (through Oxitec),[23] and an apple which resists browning (through Okanagan Specialty Fruits).[24] Other projects of Kirk's companies include creating cancer treatments, gasoline substitutes, crop protection, and improving bovine genetics.[2][25][26]
Recognition[edit]
Kirk has been profiled by SynBioBeta and Forbes.[27][28] In 2008, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine named Kirk Virginia’s Outstanding Industrialist for the Year.[29] He has spoken at the SynBioBeta Conference,[27] BioFlorida,[30] Klick Ideas Exchange[31] and was a Borlaug Dialogue Speaker at the World Food Prize.[32]
Philanthropy and other roles[edit]
Following the sale of General Injectables and Vaccines, Kirk donated $1 million to Radford University, creating the Zylphia Shu-En Kirk Endowment[6] named after his daughter.[3] Kirk has served on the board of directors of the Radford University Foundation and the school's board of visitors.[6] Kirk was a member of University of Virginia's board of visitors from 2009 to 2012.[33]
Kirk has also donated substantially to political causes. He considers himself a political independent, and has supported both Republicans and Democrats.[34] He has been especially involved in Virginia politics, donating $1.8 million to candidates for state office, including $200,000 to Terry McAuliffe's 2009 Virginia gubernatorial election.[35] [36] Since 1994 he has donated $183,250 in federal elections.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Kirk lives in West Palm Beach, Florida and has four children.[2] According to Forbes, Kirk is worth $3.3 billion and ranks No. 174 on its Forbes 400 list.[4] Kirk's hobbies include falconry.[38]

Early life and education[edit]
Randal J. Kirk was born in Pleasanton, California.[8] The son of an U.S. Air Force master sergeant,[9] Kirk and his family moved from California to Texas before settling in Virginia.[8] Kirk graduated from Dublin High School in Pulaski County, Virginia.[6] Following high school, Kirk worked selling cars and motorcycles, and enrolled part-time at Radford University to study business.[6] He earned a bachelor's degree in Economics at Radford in 1976, followed by a Juris Doctor at the University of Virginia in 1979.[7]
Career[edit]
Kirk was admitted to the bar in 1980, becoming the only attorney in Bland, Virginia, and began a practice he ran until 1990.[2][8][3] In 1983, he partnered with Bland County pharmacist John Gregory to found the next-day pharmaceutical distributor General Injectables and Vaccines. Kirk and his partners would go on to sell the business to Henry Schein, Inc. for $65 million in 1998.[9][10][11]
In 1996, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals, where he served as chairman and CEO and took the company public in 2004.[12][13] The developer of attention-deficit drug Vyvanse, New River would prove to be Kirk's single biggest payoff when he sold the company to Shire in 2007 for $2.6 billion, making over a $1 billion for Kirk himself.[2][14]
In 1999, Kirk founded the life-sciences investment firm Third Security, LLC, where he is senior managing director, CEO and chairman.[15][16] From 2000 to 2002, Kirk served as a member of the board of directors for Scios, Inc., a maker of heart disease medication that later sold to Johnson & Johnson for $2.4 billion.[17][18] Kirk also became the majority stock holder and chairman of Newton, Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company Clinical Data, Inc. In 2011, shortly after Clinical Data's drug Viibryd received regulatory approval, Forest Laboratories bought Clinical Data for $1.2 billion.[19]
Kirk became involved with biotechnology company Intrexon in the 2000s. He was named chairman of its board in 2008 and became CEO in 2009.[20] Kirk took Intrexon public in 2013, taking the company's market cap to $2.5 billion with the IPO.[21]
Kirk is involved in a number of companies advocating the approval of genetically-altered animals, including salmon (through AquaBounty),[22] disease-resistant mosquitoes (through Oxitec),[23] and an apple which resists browning (through Okanagan Specialty Fruits).[24] Other projects of Kirk's companies include creating cancer treatments, gasoline substitutes, crop protection, and improving bovine genetics.[2][25][26]
Recognition[edit]
Kirk has been profiled by SynBioBeta and Forbes.[27][28] In 2008, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine named Kirk Virginia’s Outstanding Industrialist for the Year.[29] He has spoken at the SynBioBeta Conference,[27] BioFlorida,[30] Klick Ideas Exchange[31] and was a Borlaug Dialogue Speaker at the World Food Prize.[32]
Philanthropy and other roles[edit]
Following the sale of General Injectables and Vaccines, Kirk donated $1 million to Radford University, creating the Zylphia Shu-En Kirk Endowment[6] named after his daughter.[3] Kirk has served on the board of directors of the Radford University Foundation and the school's board of visitors.[6] Kirk was a member of University of Virginia's board of visitors from 2009 to 2012.[33]
Kirk has also donated substantially to political causes. He considers himself a political independent, and has supported both Republicans and Democrats.[34] He has been especially involved in Virginia politics, donating $1.8 million to candidates for state office, including $200,000 to Terry McAuliffe's 2009 Virginia gubernatorial election.[35] [36] Since 1994 he has donated $183,250 in federal elections.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Kirk lives in West Palm Beach, Florida and has four children.[2] According to Forbes, Kirk is worth $3.3 billion and ranks No. 174 on its Forbes 400 list.[4] Kirk's hobbies include falconry.[38]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
