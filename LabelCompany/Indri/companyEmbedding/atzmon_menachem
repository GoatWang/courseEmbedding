        The Jewish State and Gilad Atzmon
      
    


December 04, 2014  /  Gilad Atzmon


BY Christopher BollynBook Review: The Wandering Who? - A Study of Jewish Identity Politics by Gilad Atzmon, Zero Books, 2011







 Zionism has failed for various reasons. Zionism could never have prevailed. It has been entangled with an endless list of sins from day one.- Gilad Atzmon, The Wandering Who?Gilad Atzmon is a gifted and articulate Israeli dissident who presents a rather grim but realistic prognosis of Zionism and the Jewish state in his book, The Wandering Who? – A Study of Jewish Identity Politics.  Atzmon’s critique of Jewish identity politics, Zionism, and Israel is timely reading given the collapse of the Israeli government over a controversial law that would redefine the State of Israel as "the nation-state of the Jewish people.”The fundamental question about the proposed “Jewish state” law is this: Will it promote peace? Given the violent reaction to the proposal of the bill it seems obvious that it will not solve any of the pressing political problems in Palestine and would only exacerbate the very real tension between Jews and Palestinians in the Holy Land if it were adopted into law.According to Atzmon, it is precisely the ethno-centric notion that Israel should be “the Jewish state” which prevents it from being a normal and peaceful nation:Israel is the Jewish state and Jewishness is an ethno-centric ideology driven by exclusiveness, exceptionalism, racial supremacy and a deep inherent inclination toward segregation. For Israel and Israelis to become people like other people, all traces of Jewish ideological superiority must be eliminated first. For the Jewish state to lead a peace initiative, Israel must be de-Zionised – it should first stop being the Jewish State. I happened to meet Gilad Atzmon when our paths crossed in Portland, Oregon, in September. I had the chance to talk to him and wanted to ask him if he was related to Menachem Atzmon, the key Israeli defendant in the 9-11 tort litigation. Gilad was quick to answer and said that he is indeed related to Menachem Atzmon.Menachem Atzmon is a former Likud party co-treasurer who, along with Ehud Olmert was charged with illegal campaign financing in Israel. Although Atzmon had been working with Ehud Olmert, Atzmon was convicted while Olmert was not. Olmert, the former mayor of Jerusalem and prime minister, has since been convicted and sentenced to prison on other charges involving accepting illegal funds.   Atzmon went on to head an Israeli security company called International Consultants on Targeted Security (ICTS), which is based in Holland. ICTS happens to be the parent company of Huntleigh USA, the former American company that managed passenger screening operations at Boston’s Logan Airport on 9-11. ICTS was the key defendant in the 9-11 tort litigation but was excused from the process by a decision of the federal judge Alvin K. Hellerstein. It should be noted that there was a blatant conflict of interest in Judge Hellerstein’s management of the 9-11 tort litigation. While Judge Hellerstein was overseeing the tort litigation, his son, Joseph, was living in Israel (on an illegal settlement) and working in a law firm that represented the parent company of ICTS.Gilad not only confirmed that he was related to Menachem Atzmon, but added that he is also related to Nathan Friedman-Yellin (a.k.a. Nathan Yellin-Mor) the Zionist activist from Grodno who worked closely with Avraham Stern and migrated to Palestine in 1941 to found LEHI, the radical Jewish terrorist group also known as the Stern Gang.After Stern's death, Yellin-Mor became the political leader of LEHI along with Yitzhak Shamir (operations) and Israel Eldad (propaganda). Yellin-Mor was one of the planners of the assassination in Cairo of Lord Moyne, the British minister of state in the Middle East, in November 1944. Yellin-Mor was also found guilty of “leadership of a terrorist organization” after LEHI assassins murdered the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte, who was serving as United Nations emissary in Jerusalem in September 1948. Although Yellin-Mor and LEHI member Matityahu “Matty” Shmuelevitz were found guilty on January 25, 1949, and Yellin-Mor was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment, both terrorists were pardoned shortly after the trial.







TERRORIST ASSASSINS Nathan (Friedman) Yellin-Mor (center) and Matty Shmuelevitz (left) in 1949 after being pardoned for having murdered the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte, the UN special envoy to Palestine, in September 1948. Yellin-Mor then joined the first Knesset (government) of Israel. Shmuelevitz shares the family name with the mother of Rahm Emanuel.  Emanuel's father, Benjamin (Auerbach) Emanuel, was also a member of the terrorist LEHI group and married Marsha Smulevitz. There is a resemblance in the face of Matty and Rahm Emanuel. Shmuelevitz went on the be the chief-of-staff for Menachem Begin.







Matty Shmuelevitz served as the "director general" of Begin's office.  I would guess that Matty is the man on the far left in this photo from 1983.  At this point the plans for 9-11 had already begun and the stage was being set in the United States for the biggest false-flag terror attack in history.  If Rahm Emanuel is related to Matty Shmuelevitz, as I suggest, then we can understand the role Emanuel played in setting the stage during the Clinton administrations, when he served as a special advisor to the president.So, when Gilad Atzmon says that Zionism has “been entangled with an endless list of sins from day one,” he knows what he is talking about. He does not hide the fact that he was raised in a family that is tied to Jewish terrorism. As he says in the opening lines of his book:My grandfather was a charismatic, poetic, veteran Zionist terrorist. A former prominent commander in the right-wing Irgun terror organization…His family's relationship to Zionist terrorism gives Gilad Atzmon’s perspective an authenticity that is lacking in much of the literature about Zionism and Israel. Atzmon is more than just another critical Israeli who grew up during the time of the Six-Day War (1967), the Yom Kippur War (1973), and the invasion of Lebanon (1982) – his ancestors are among the key terrorists behind the creation of the state of Israel and, as we now know, one of his relatives played a key role in the false-flag terrorism of 9-11. Atzmon’s insights about Israel and Jewish identity politics come from a dissident who was raised in a family of dedicated Zionists. This is why I think his critique of Zionism is one of the essential books of our time. Most Americans have very little, if any, understanding of what Zionism means in reality although their government is the most important financier and political supporter of the “Jewish state.” This lack of understanding is intentional, of course. The history of Israel is not taught in our universities and our controlled media presents an utterly false image of what Zionism is all about.If the history of Zionism were taught at our universities, Atzmon’s book would certainly be on the reading list because it is the voice of an honest and articulate Israeli dissident:As a young Israeli I believed in the Zionist ethos, I regarded myself an inherent part of the Jewish modern revival project. I saw myself as part of Jewish history, and Jewish history as an extension of myself. As a young Israeli growing up in the post-1967 era, I saw myself and the people around me as an evolving collective consciousness, fighting a revolutionary battle for historic justice…As a young secular Israeli Jew, I believed enthusiastically in the possibility of transformation of the Jewish character into a ‘civilised, authentic humanist collective’. I believed myself to be one. I then grasped, through a long and painful process that Israel wouldn’t bring about a humanist Jew. It was entangled in a colossal sin and it was far too arrogant to save itself from its doomed circumstances.Although the U.S. government is the primary supporter of the state of Israel and the assembled members of Congress gave twenty-nine standing ovations to its extreme right-wing prime minister, most Americans, Jews and Gentiles alike, function with “an imaginary Israel” in their mind, something that they want to believe in, but which bears no resemblance to reality. As I often say about naïve apologists for Israel: They simply do not understand the nature of the beast. This is why I find the following extract from Atzmon’s book to be the most important. It explains in plain English the essence of “the Jewish state”:One may be left perplexed on learning that just three years after the liberation of Auschwitz (1945) the newly-formed Jewish state ethnically cleansed the vast majority of the indigenous population of Palestine (1948). Just five years after the end of World War Two, the Jewish state brought to life racially-discriminatory return laws in order to prevent the 1948 Palestinian refugees from coming back to their cities, villages, fields and orchards. These laws, still in place today, were not categorically different from the notorious Nazi Nuremberg Laws.These are the essential facts about “the Jewish state” that need to be taken into consideration when we discuss the state of Israel. The well-written Atzmon critique is contained in a small book of about 200 pages yet he manages to deftly handle all of the main issues of Jewish identity politics and Zionism with intelligence and humor.There is one point where Atzmon and I do not agree. In several places he says, “I do not believe in Jewish conspiracies; everything is done in the open." I, on the other hand, think that a great deal of Zionist planning is done in secret societies, like the B’nai B’rith, the parent organization of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Hillel. The Zionist planning of the false-flag terrorism of 9-11, for example, was clearly done behind closed doors in a secret society where oaths of secrecy have been sworn.  Such secret societies exist for a reason and secrecy is the most important aspect of such organizations.I asked Gilad about this statement and told him that my reading of Zionist history revealed that secret societies like the B'nai Moshe, B'nai B'rith, and others, played key roles in creating the Zionist fervor in Eastern Europe in the late 1800s and beyond. One source in particular, the Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, by Raphael Patai, Herzl Press, 1971, has many articles about these secret societies. He wrote back agreeing that this “could be an open subject to debate.” Sources:  Atzmon, Gilad, The Wandering Who? - A Study of Jewish Identity Politics, Zero Books (UK), 2011  "Begin's legacy:  'Yehiel, it ends today' - The day that Menachem Begin announced he would resign as prime minister," by Shlomo Nakdimon, Ha'aretz (Israel), February 22, 2012 http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/begin-s-legacy-yehiel-it-ends-today-1.414173 "Bollyn meets Gilad Atzmon" by Christopher Bollyn, September 23, 2014bollyn.com/bollyn-meets-gilad-atzmon/"Gilad Atzmon Confirms Shaul Eisenberg Connection to ICTS" by Christopher Bollyn, November 6, 2014www.bollyn.com/gilad-atzmon-confirms-shaul-eisenberg-connection-to-icts/ - See more at: http://www.bollyn.com/14973#sthash.PwERWSHx.dpuf

Menachem Atzmon


WTC,9/11:Joseph Campbell Plagiarizes Chris Bollyn and says he'd like to 'slash' conspiracy theorists 'with a rusty steak knife' 
 



Was Anders Behring Breivik Norway Terrorism funded by CIA or Israeli fraud,money laundering with U.S stock frauds ?
Was Anders Behring Breivik Norway Terrorism funded by CIA or Israeli
fraud,money laundering with U.S. penny stocks ?
I ask this question in light of antiwar.com 'libertarian' blogger
Justin Raimondo recent  mention  in his blog that  Anders Behring
Breivik claims 'to have been the "managing director" of "E-Commerce
Group AS," which is described as a "part investment company – 50%,
part sales/outsourcing company – 50%," with a "total of 7 employees: 3
in Norway, 1 in Russia, 1 in Indonesia, 1 in Romania, 1 in the US."

For Whom The Nobel Tolls:Barack Obama,9/11,London 7/7/05,Norway 2011
 
 
Below is brief quote and link to  one of the most  informative blogs I
came across while researching the recent mass murder and terrorism in
Norway by Anders Behring Breivik.To anyone who took seriously Barack
Barry Soetoro Obama's pretense of concern or phony offer of help I
would remind them of his lie about 'connecting the dots' immediately
following the flight 253 'crotch bomber' incident involving the
failed 'security' at Shipol Airport Amsterdam when he and his handlers
and  the entire U.S.government and Rupert Murdoch Fox and CNN and
CNBC,as well as Zionist and right wing elite controlled newspapers and media 
from  coast to coast,etc. suppressed all mentiion of the fact that it
was once again convicted,(in Israel)money launderer Menachem Atzmon
and his Shin Bet boys of ICTS International that The Netherlands Queen
Beatrix,Geert Wilders and the Rothschild crime family alowed and
continue to allow to control all 'security' at Shipol who allowed the
Isla Nigerian 'crotch bomber' to board flight 253 from Amsterdam to
Detroit on Christmas 2009 in the first place ! For any country that
must depend upon the U.S.government or the UK Lords of London and the
Rothschilds and their Israeli henchman for 'security' all I can say is
may the Lord,(Rothschild),have mercy on your souls.(Which is highly
unlikely.)
I'm sorry to say that had he been born  in Amerikkka Mr, Anders
Behring Breivik would probably be one of our most influential and
powerful politicians by now.

Oslo Bombing Suspect Anders Behring Breivik
We’ve been screaming from the top of our lungs about how these crazed
radical anti-Muslim Islamophobes are inciting violence through their
hate-mongering. Anders Behring Breivak, arrested as a suspect in the
attack has written glowingly of Geert Wilders, Robert Spencer, SIOE,
and the EDL. Charles Johnson of LGF reports that he had a link with
Fjordman who was a guest writer on Geller’s blog.
Terrorism in Europe has been over linked to an Islamic Muslim threat,
even though we reported on how exaggerated the claim was: Europol
Report: All Muslims are Terrorists…Except the 99.6% that Aren’t.
What Just Happened in Oslo, Norway? (UPDATES)
(Mother-Jones)
This explainer is being updated as more news emerges. Click here for
photos from the sceneand here for details about the man arrested in
connection with the attacks. For the latest news updates, click here.
The basics: A massive explosion hit Norway’s government hub in central
Oslo on Friday, killing at least seven people and injuring at least 15
others. The six-story building that was most heavily damaged included
the oil ministry and is next to the building that houses the office of
Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. The PM was unharmed in the blast and
is now operating out of an undisclosed location. Witness testimony and
damage at the scene are consistent with reports of a car bombing. The
New York Times reports:
Stunned office staff and civil servants working in the vicinity of the
bombed building said two explosions could be heard in close
succession. The sound of the blasts echoed across the city just before
3:30 p.m. local time. Giant clouds of light-colored smoke continued to
rise hundreds of feet into the air over the city…
Photos and television footage showed windows blown out in the 17-story
office building across the street from the oil ministry, and the
street and plaza areas on each side were strewn with glass and
debris...............................
 
 
my comment:
The Gates Of Vienna website has defended their side by dismissing and
probably successfully debunking the claim that Anders Behring Breivak
is really the alias Fjordman who in truth I know nothing about as I am
not a follower of his tirades.However the more important points you
are making are that this is a mute point in light of the fact that
Anders Breivak’s points of view are so similar to the internet alias
Fjordman’s views that they are indistinguishable and in fact one might
say that Fjordman’s as well as Geert Wilders’,et.al.’s views are
mirrors or vice versa of the views ofAnders Breivak.And if this is the
case and I would have to say that is undeniable at this point,then
indeed Anders Breivak has to be seen as a Zionist or pro
Zionist,(I.E.-SAME DIFFERENCE,NONE).
That said what has the present Norwegian government done to set him
off ? I only noticed in searching this wingnut site called
brusselsjournal.com that equates a Norwegian consumer boycott of
Israeli products with war!
With Friends Like Norway, Who Needs Enemies? | The Brussels Journal
http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/649 – Cached9 Jan 2006 – Last
Thursday Kristin Halvorsen (45), the Norwegian Minister of Finance,
said that she is in favour of boycotting Israel. …
……………………………………………
And I’m not sure if Norway has withdrawn these investments since the
article below but I do know they were attacked by Israeli Finance
Minister and money launderer Avigdor Liebermann who some claim Anders
Breivik may also be an admirer of.Norway’s divestment from the Israeli
military industrial corporation Elbit particularly rubbed him and his
fellow Israeli white wingnuts who erroneously claim to be
‘semites’,the wrong way.But most recently Norway has said it is
withdrawing from NATO’s war crimes and mass bombing campaign in Libya
which may have been the ‘breaking point’.Certainly if Norway has a
militant far right in Norway capable of hating fellow citizens who do
not tow their pro Zionist views then it is just as likely that they
also have pro wingnut Zionist on the inside of their government as
well which is the only way of explaining the Norwegian goverment being
suckered into participating in the UK’s the French Sarkosey’s and the
U.S. and NATO’s fascist actions in Libya in the the first place !
If I were Norwegian I would look a lot closer at these British right
wing elites and and France’s Sarkosey and Barack Barry Soetoro Obama
they gave a Nobel to and ask myself if I really trusted ‘friends’ such
as them.Maybe Norway could call for a real 9/11 investigation from
Barry Soetoro or Barack Obama who they gave a Nobel to in the first
place and from their ‘allies’ in the UK,(who are so anxious to ‘help’
them now in their hour of tragedy), to take a new look at the London
bombings of 7/7/05.After all the Norwegians and their government can
easily verify that the the Israelis of ICTS International who guarded
Logan Airport Boston on 9/11/01 also have ties to both the UK where
they appear to have played a role in rail ‘security’ at the time of
the London subway bombings and even now they control Geert Wilders’
and Queen Batrix’ and I believe the Rothschild’s Shiphol Airport in
Amsterdam that allowed that Nigerian Islamic ‘crotch bomber’ Farouk
Abdul Mutallab to board flight 253 of Christmas 2009 in route for
Detroit that set off all those draconian plane searches in both the
U.S. and Europe in 2010,(lest we forgot) ! And Farouk Abdul Mutallab
father is ‘coincidentally’ a major Israeli arms dealer in his country
of Nigeria !
I placed articles with links below to document most of my statements
above as well as an article I wtrote regarding Obnama,Geert Wilders
and Menachem Atzmon and the Israelis of ICTS International who guard
Shiphol Airport even after all their outrages stock frauds and
security frauds including it appears a role ‘security’ during the
January Moscow airport bombing !
I wish in light of this most recent tragedy that instead of the UK
fascists playing ‘big brother’ to the Norwegians that Noray would go
on the moral offensive and take them as well as Geert Wilders’ and
Queen Beatrix’s Holland to task for allowing ICTS to continue tp
provide ‘security’ for all Europeans and others unfortunate enmough to
have to pass through Shipol Airport in the Netherlands !

Airport Amsterdam Christmas 2009 and Chabad Lubavitch in Moscow
Why should anyone be surprised that the Zionist cult that claims its
deceased criminally insane founder is the Jewish 'Messiah' should be
the first 'responders' to turn up at the Moscow Airport to grieve over
the dead and dying 'goyim' all around them and even bring 'kosher'
food as if they were invited to a party !?.......Worse yet,it appears
that Menachem Atzmon and his notorious Israeli money launderers and
9/11 mass murder  suspects and thus war criminals of ICTS
International who 'guarded' Logan Airport Boston and Newark Airport on
9/11/01 and allowed Richard Reid 'the shoe bomber' to board at De
Gualle,Paris,etc.,etc., and more recently the Nigerian crotch bomber
to board flight 253 from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to Detroit with
his alleged 'crotch bomb' on Christmas 2009 to also have or share
'security' responsibilty for Moscow's Domodedovo Airport.

WTC,9/11,ICTS International,NY Mosque:Netherlands Geert Wilders,Barack

Submitted by Tony Ryals on Wed, 09/08/2010 – 23:58
As far as I’m concerned 9/11 or
September 11 is now the official Barack Osama Obama and America’s new
April Fools Day..Prepare to laugh till you cry next month as Barack
Osama makes a sick jokes of thousands of mass murder victims.Osama bin
Laden did it now move along folks…And to be fair and balanced Barack
Osama Obama never mentions Odigo and it stock fraudster Israeli CEO
living the life of Reilly in Africa on money stolen from Americans in
stock fraud or Marvin Bush and Al Sabah Kuwaiti royalty involvement in
Securacom…..
What do Mansoor Ijaz,Barack Obama,Geert Wilders,NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg,
Asra Nomani,Judea Pearl all have in common besides opening their big
mouths again this
time re the construction pro or con of a ’9/11 Mosque’ ? They all know
that the two planes
that hit Rudy Giuliani’s WTC and now Mayor Bloomberg’s ‘ground zer0′
on 9/11/01 were
under the ‘security’ of ICTS International-Huntleigh owned(through
stock fraud) by felon Menachem
Atzmon and his fellow Shin Beit Israeli crime family.They allowed
Richard Reid the shoe bomber who
Daniel Pearl was investigating at the time of his beheading in
Pakistan to board an American Airlines
flight to the U.S.from DeGualle Airport France even though they knew
who he was having facilitated his
trip to Israel on El Al from Schiphol Airport Amsterdam pre 9/11!

May Day,WTC,9/11:U.S.Resident Barack Obama cries,'Osama bin Laden',
U.N.Ambassador Susan Rice liies ' Viagra Rape !'
http://indymedia.nl/nl/2011/05/76182.shtml
 
NOTE BELOW  THAT MY POST BELOW OF SEPTEMBER 11,2009 WARNS ALMOST 4
MONTHS IN ADVANCE THAT THE ISRAELI CRIMINALS AND SHIN BET BOYS OF ICTS
INTERNATIONAL ARE STILL 'GUARDING' AIRPORTS,IN EUROPE AND AT SHIPHOL
AMSTERDAM IN PARTICULAR.YET EVEN AFTER THE FACT OF FLIGHT 253 BARCK
BARRY SOETORO OBAMA AND HIS CRIMINALLY INSANE HOMELAND SECURITY
CSARINA JANET  NAPOLITANO DID NOTHING ! ALTHOUGH MENACHEM ATZMON
CONTINUES T THE HELM OF ICTS AND IN CONTROL OF SHIPOL AIRPORT AND ICTS
EUROPE WAS ALSO IN 'CIONTROL OF MOSCOW AIRPORT DURING BOMMBING THAT
KILLED AT LEAST 35 THIS JANUARY BARACK OSAMA OBAMA STILL CAN'T
'CONNECT THE DOTS' FOR SOME REASON.:
 
9/11,WTC:Osama bin Laden on FBI Unwanted List;Barack Obama A Skinny Idi Amin ?
Barack Obama may turn out to be a skinny Idi Amin.I knew of course all
the Zionists and outright mafiosi and rapers of the U.S .economy that
helped fund him and that he was following the Zionist PARTY line that
Afghani peasants caused 9/11 and thus don't investigate the Israelis
Menachem Atzmon,Ezra Harel,  et.al., criminals of ICTS International
pro Israeli connections or Securacom of Marvin Bush and the Kuwait Al
Sabah royalty at Dulles Airport Washington,D.C. and the WTC in New
York or the real cause for collapse of the WTC which may well turn out
to be super thermite rather than the planes themselves.But as it turns
out Idi Amin was backed and brought to power by Israeli Zionist war
and financial criminals just as Barack Obama appears to have been !

Julian Assange,Wikileaks:Veterans Today Editor Gordon Duff is A
CIA,George Tenet Prostitute,So is Agora Inc.'s Lila Rajiva
No matter what one thinks of Julian Assange and Wikileaks he and it
could in no way be more evil than ex CIA Chief George Tenet  who
helped  W Bush and Dick Cheny et.al. to start their mass murder and
probable radioactive nuclear poisoning of Iraq,the or a major  'cradle
of agriculture and civilization.
So when Veterans Today editor Gordon Duff bragged about knowing the
scumbag and at the same time he told me that Agora Inc or CIA(same
difference) connected Lila Rajiva was joining Veterans Today as a ha
journalist even though he had just
previously told me she was 'gone',I almost barfed.In a real country of
law this Indian
foreign national would be facing plenty of jail time for her
involvement with the stock fraud money launderers and murder suspects
of Agora Inc who not only employ scumbags like CIA 'economist' Mark
Skousen who touted or promoted over the
internet to sell worthless shares of the CIA's In-Q-Tel penny stock
fraud called  Ionatron that claimed-lyed about   having technology to
remove improvised explosive devices from roads of Iraq and
Afghanistan.
