An Interview with David B. Fischer, President and Chief Executive Officer, Greif


Editors’ Note
Named CEO in 2011, David Fischer joined Greif in 2004 as Senior Vice President and Divisional President, Industrial Packaging & Services-Americas. He later assumed responsibility for IP&S operations in Asia, Australia, and Africa. Prior to Greif, Fischer was Business Vice President for the Polyurethanes business at Dow. He has a bachelor’s degree from Purdue University where he studied chemistry.
Company Brief
Greif (www.greif.com) is a world leader in industrial packaging products and services. The company produces steel, plastic, fibre, flexible, corrugated and multiwall containers and containerboard, and provides reconditioning, blending, filling, and packaging services for a wide range of industries. Greif also manages timber properties in North America. The company is strategically positioned in more than 55 countries to serve global as well as regional customers.


packH20

How did you determine that packH20 was a good fit for Greif and that you could be of benefit to this cause?
I’m blessed to work for a 135-year-old company where giving back has long been a mantra of our culture. Greif lives by the belief that how we treat others really matters. Being a member of the Clinton Global Initiative afforded me the opportunity to find a way for Greif to contribute.
My life experiences are what led me to the backpack concept; utilizing the packaging resources of Greif. My personal experiences with cancer, and my environmental health and safety training working 20 years for Dow Chemical and some product design exposure led to the first for-purpose, ergonomically correct personal water transport system that is for the poorest among us.
Traveling to countries we operate in around the world, I have all too often watched the poor carry their water daily in contaminated plastic containers. Thousands of people are doing fantastic work at generating clean water sources, but it’s all for naught when the clean water becomes contaminated by being put into these containers. We found a niche solution to a problem that challenges two billion-plus people every year.


packH20 in action in Africa

How have you overcome the challenges of distribution?
While serving customers in more than 50 countries around the world, we have a good global supply chain, but the last mile is really challenging. So we have had to develop partnerships with locally established NGOs that will not only distribute the packs but train these people in how to utilize the packs properly and, most importantly, how to keep them sterile with repetitive use.
The partnerships we develop have that capability for distribution and training, as well as the trust of the locals so we can get them to properly use them: people like Partners In Health, Dr. Paul Farmer’s group out of Harvard; Operation Blessing, which stems from Pat Robertson’s 700 Club; Habitat for Humanity International and local; Special Olympics; and Partners In Care out of Africa.
To make it sustainable, we need that training aspect as well as expertise in building microenterprises with people locally sewing the backpacks – the backpack was designed to cost about the same as a McDonald’s hamburger to produce, and to get it around the world and across that last mile, it had to be flexible.
We can send local entrepreneurs the fabric, the lining, and the strapping and they can participate in the value chain to make it sustainable.
Are you surprised that more hasn’t been done to attack the problem? 
The numbers are staggering – over two billion people are living with the daily challenge of gathering water. Even with 280 manufacturing sites around the world, we can make 100 million of a certain product line, but that is 5 percent of the addressable problem. 
The surprise for me is that there is virtually no material work of scale being done on the personal water transportation issue – and that is the Achilles’ heel of the water problem. The unfortunate hard truth of water philanthropy: generating clean water is a feel-good and absolutely necessary initiative and is being done well, but some people don’t want to acknowledge that the hard-to-address problem is in keeping the water clean until the family consumes it at home.
How important is it to put metrics in place to track the impact of these efforts?
I’ve learned that no matter how hard I try to convince certain people – and this is largely Western based academics who critique the philanthropic efforts in the world and philanthropic-minded NGOs that are Western based – they always ask for metrics. So we hired Battelle Institute, the world’s largest nonprofit research and development organization, to do contamination studies of existing vessels. We also partnered with Dr. Paul Farmer out of Harvard and Partners In Health to do social and economic studies of people using the packs so I could generate quantified data to convince people that we’re onto something that matters.
I often disperse the packs to these women firsthand and in some cases, they are nearly euphoric about getting the product. When I get that response, I don’t care about the analytics or justifying our approach to academic-minded researchers; I know we’re making a difference.•


“Habitat for Humanity International is truly blessed to play a role in introducing the packH2O water backpacks to families and communities as part of regular programming, through partners and in connection with disaster response where Habitat has field-tested the packs in 18 locations throughout Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific. Teaching refugees in a camp for IDPs (internally displaced people) in Kenya and rural farmers in Nicaragua how to use the packs for carrying water safely has been uplifting. Habitat is currently testing the health benefits of the packs resulting from reductions in water-borne illnesses and physical pain associated with water transport.
Based on the success of these activities to date, Habitat country programs have requested 117,000 more packs. Habitat is working with Greif to identify resources to proceed with placement of 100,000 packs in nine countries over the next 12 months. In addition, having met collectively with water experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the packs, Greif and Habitat are exploring research relating to the packs and a global water and sanitation partnership whereby the packs and other Greif products would enable Habitat to reach a broad array of people in need of shelter and access to clean water on a global scale.”
-Liz Blake, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Advocacy and General Counsel, Habitat for Humanity

DELAWARE, Ohio (Sept. 19, 2007) – The Board of Directors of Greif, Inc. (NYSE: GEF, GEF.B) has elected David B. Fischer, 45, president and chief operating officer of the company.

Michael C. Patton, 46, senior vice president of Paper, Packaging & Services, will also lead IP&S – North America. He was named divisional president as well.
Senior Vice President Ivan Signorelli, 55, of Greif’s IP&S – Europe strategic business unit, also adds the title of divisional president.
Signorelli and Patton will report to Fischer. The changes are effective Oct. 1.
Gasser said, “David’s proven track record in operations, mergers and acquisitions and business integration make him ideally suited for his new position. His leadership and counsel will be a driving force as we continue to execute our aggressive growth strategy.
”Mike has been a strong leader in all his roles within Greif. Because of his deep understanding of the Greif Business System and his ability to effect change, he is the right person to take our business in North America to the next level.
“With Ivan in Europe, we have a strong operations team in place that will be instrumental in achieving our goals,” Gasser said.
Fischer joined Greif in November 2004 to lead Greif’s Industrial Packaging & Services – Americas business. He was later assigned responsibility for the company’s IP&S businesses in Asia, Africa and Australia. He came to Greif from The Dow Chemical Company, where he was previously global business vice president of the company’s $1.8 billion polyurethanes business.

Patton holds a bachelor’s degree in Finance from Seton Hall University.

Highlights, News & Knowledge

 

David B. Blair is a partner and chair of Crowell & Moring's Tax Group. Mr. Blair's practice is in the area of federal tax litigation and controversy. With over twenty years of tax litigation and trial experience, he has handled large tax litigations in the areas of transfer pricing, foreign tax credits, partnerships, tax-exempt bonds, consolidated returns, excise taxes, employment taxes, and tax accounting issues. He is also active in pro bono litigation. Where clients sought resolution short of litigation, Mr. Blair achieved outstanding results through alternative dispute resolution procedures, including the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Fast Track Settlement program. He also has extensive experience in handling tax controversies before IRS Exam, Appeals, National Office, and Advance Pricing and Mutual Agreement program (APMA).
A recognized authority on tax controversy, Mr. Blair teaches transfer pricing as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, and regularly speaks at tax conferences and symposia. He is the editor of The Transfer Pricing Answer Book (Practising Law Institute) and a co-author of the BNA Tax Management Portfolio No. 891-2nd, "Transfer Pricing: Audits, Appeals, and Penalties."
Mr. Blair began his career as a trial attorney for the Tax Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, where he litigated tax issues before the United States District and Bankruptcy Courts.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Omnicom results top Street on UK, Europe growth
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    7:12 AM ET 07/20/2017
                                                


Omnicom Group Inc (OMC) reported better-than-expected quarterly results as the No. 1 U.S. advertising company benefited from higher spending from businesses in Europe and the United Kingdom. That helped allay some concerns about growth abroad following Britain's decision to leave the European Union.

Omnicom Group Inc (OMC), the No.1 U.S. advertising company, reported a 2.4 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by slower growth in North America. Revenue fell to $3.79 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $3.88 billion a year earlier.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
