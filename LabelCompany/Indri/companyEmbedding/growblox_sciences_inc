LAS VEGAS, May 30, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- GrowBLOX Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: GBLX) announced today that the first of its patent pending proprietary agricultural indoor growing system for medical-grade cannabis has come off the production line. GrowBLOX Sciences has developed proprietary growing technology for environmentally controlled, indoor agricultural chambers. This is the first of the newest generation of GrowBLOX's that are expected to arrive at The Company's headquarters in Nevada by mid-June. The Company anticipates beginning quality control on both mechanics and its proprietary monitoring and report-building software before starting the full production line. The quality control test will be run by Chief Scientist and Botanist, Ulrich Reimann-Philipp, Ph.D.
"GrowBLOX Sciences is in an exciting phase in its development and we have positioned ourselves to move forward with our patent pending technology in order to change the way indoor growing methodologies take place. We are thrilled the fist indoor growing chamber is off the line and our Chief Scientist and Botanist is ready to begin quality control testing. From our indoor growing chambers to our monitoring and reporting systems, we believe our proprietary technology will impact the future of medical-grade products in Nevada," said GrowBLOX CEO, Craig Ellins.
As GrowBLOX Sciences awaits the arrival of its first indoor growing chamber off the production line, The Company is also awaiting approval on its licensing from Clark County, Nevada for their cultivation and dispensary licenses. The Company has applied for three licenses, one for cultivation and two for dispensaries.
About GrowBLOX Sciences, Inc.GrowBLOX Sciences, Inc., is a research and biotechnical company that has developed proprietary indoor growing chambers specifically designed for medical cannabis cultivation. The GrowBLOX chamber allows for completely controlled growing conditions, ensuring the manufacture of a consistent, toxin-free, natural and medicinal-grade product. The Company believes that the advantages of a controlled environment over traditional outdoor or greenhouse growing, will empower the public, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries to embrace cannabis as an effective treatment for a myriad of serious medical conditions. http://www.gbsciences.com

LAS VEGAS, Oct. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Growblox Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: GBLX) announces today that it has acquired two additional Medical Marijuana Establishment ("MME") licenses in Clark County, Nevada.  Growblox has formed GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC. in order to acquire these two licenses. Growblox will be the owner/operator of the businesses and own 60% of the entity with the option to own up to 80%.  








The production license will be incorporated into our cannabis cultivation facility in Las Vegas, NV.  This license will allow Growblox to convert plants to oil, which opens a vast market that utilizes more of the plant, and produces a higher profit margin.  These oils can then be used to make many popular products, such as personal vaporizer pens, gel caps, edibles, a large number of beauty aids, cosmetics, pure botanicals, extracts, and much more. 
The cultivation license expands our current Nevada cultivation capacity well beyond the current capacity of 28,000 sq ft, which can support, 4000 plants, with a 20 million dollar run rate at full production. 
"I am extremely pleased to see our hard work come to fruition.  These cultivation and production licenses will position us to offer a highly diverse suite of products for patients from all medical cannabis-approved states, due to Nevada's critical reciprocity regulation.  This will also enhance Growblox's positioning as a fully vertically-integrated and formidable presence in the Nevada Medical Cannabis Market," stated John Poss, Growblox CEO.
About Growblox Sciences, Inc.Growblox Sciences, Inc. (GBLX) is a diverse vertically integrated cannabis company, focused on cultivation as well as biopharmaceutical research and development. The Company's goal is creating safe, standardized, pharmaceutical-grade, cannabinoid therapies that target a variety of medical conditions.

Growblox will be the owner/operator of the businesses and own 60% of the entity with the option to own up to 80%. The production license will be incorporated into our cannabis cultivation facility in Las Vegas, NV.  This license will allow Growblox to convert plants to oil, which opens a vast market that utilizes more of the plant, and produces a higher profit margin.  These oils can then be used to make many popular products, such as personal vaporizer pens, gel caps, edibles, a large number of beauty aids, cosmetics, pure botanicals, extracts, and much more.The cultivation license expands our current Nevada cultivation capacity well beyond the current capacity of 28,000 sq ft, which can support, 4000 plants, with a 20 million dollar run rate at full production."I am extremely pleased to see our hard work come to fruition.  These cultivation and production licenses will position us to offer a highly diverse suite of products for patients from all medical cannabis-approved states, due to Nevada's critical reciprocity regulation.  This will also enhance Growblox's positioning as a fully vertically-integrated and formidable presence in the Nevada Medical Cannabis Market," stated John Poss, Growblox CEO.About Growblox Sciences, Inc.Growblox Sciences, Inc.

To add to our ever growing list of interesting marijuana related stocks, we’re taking a look at Growblox Sciences, Inc. (OTCMKTS:GBLX) today, a company devoted to developing cutting-edge techniques in  cannabis cultivation and by-product extraction, as well as retail distribution.
To kick off 2017, the company announced it had obtained its Nevada State Registration Certificate for a 28,000 sq. ft. cannabis cultivation facility in Las Vegas. The facility is designed to house 200 grow lights supporting roughly 800 cannabis plants, with expected yields of up to 115 pounds per month.  The company plans to eventually build out the facility to 1000 grow lights/ 4000 plants, which could generate over $20 million in revenue annually.
To go along with its cultivation efforts which should soon begin to generate revenue, Growblox Sciences, Inc. (OTCMKTS:GBLX) also has some really cool ideas with regard to retail distribution of its products, including a state-of-the-art apothecary facility along with an accompanying mobile app, as well as a secure cannabis vending machine solution.

(Growblox) is engaged in developing and utilizing technologies in plant biology, cultivation and extraction techniques combined with biotechnology, and plans to produce medical-grade cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabinoid therapies. The Company seeks to be a technology and solution company that converts the cannabis plant into medicines, therapies and treatments for a range of ailments. Growblox intends to conduct its business operations, through its subsidiaries, in approximately three operating units, which include Solutions, Sciences and Product divisions.

The Apothecary by GB Sciences combines a simple, clean and clinical design with cutting edge bio-metrics and patient verification to deliver a pleasant and safe customer experience.Highly trained and certified ApotheCAREians will work with patients to determine their medical needs, identify therapeutic products, install GB Sciences’ app on their hand-held devices, and demonstrate how to place orders.
The Micro Apothecary is a self-service vending kiosk.  The interactive LED monitors display essential product and patient safety information and doubles as the touch screen interface that allows you to create a new patient profile or sign in to an existing account.
The Apothecary will have a mobile app as a powerful tool for building a strong patient- dispensary relationship.
