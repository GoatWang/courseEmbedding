Overview
Our Funds
Our History



AOF II
In May 2015, Athyrium announced a final closing for the Athyrium Opportunities Fund II ("AOF II" or the "Fund"). The Fund has $1,227,250,000 of committed capital. The Fund is focused on making structured investments in the broader healthcare and life sciences sectors including: pharmaceuticals, biologics, biotechnology, specialty and generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices and products, laboratory and diagnostics products and services, healthcare services, and healthcare information technology.
The Fund is focused on generating current income and capital gains and has significant flexibility in structuring its investments–possible transaction structures include: loans or other high-yielding credit investments with or without warrant coverage, royalties or royalty-backed investments, structured securities, preferred stock, or convertible securities.
The Fund seeks to make attractive risk-adjusted returns and looks to partner with management teams and to provide long term capital to assist in building their businesses. The Fund can also engage in secondary market transactions.
AOF II is a successor Fund to the Athyrium Opportunities Fund ("AOF I") which had a final closing in March 2013 with $507 million of committed capital.
Separate Accounts
Since its founding, Athyrium has formed a number of separate account relationships in order to focus on specific opportunities within the life sciences sector.
NB Athyrium LLC served as a predecessor to the Athyrium Opportunities Fund.

Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, May 20, 2013 – Neuberger Berman Group LLC, one of the world’s leading employee-controlled money managers, and Athyrium Capital Management, an asset management company focused on opportunities in the global healthcare sector, announced the closing of Athyrium Opportunities Fund LP (the “Fund” or “Athyrium Opportunities”), a private credit fund that seeks to invest in a diversified pool of income-generating structured investments in the global healthcare sector. Athyrium Opportunities was oversubscribed, closing at $507 million.
Athyrium Opportunities seeks to make $25–$75 million financings in small- to medium-sized healthcare companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Fund focuses on partnering with management teams of pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostics companies with commercial-stage products and services who are looking for long term capital to grow their businesses. The Fund seeks to generate current income and capital gains for its investors and has significant flexibility in structuring its investments – possible transaction structures include loans, notes, royalties or royalty-backed debt, preferred stock, convertible or other structured securities. The Fund has made five investments to date representing over 20% of committed capital.
The Fund is jointly managed by Neuberger Berman and Athyrium Capital Management. Neuberger Berman’s alternatives business (“NB Alternatives”) and Athyrium Capital Management formed a strategic relationship in 2009 to source, close and manage structured investments in the healthcare sector. Since forming the strategic relationship, the team has completed more than a dozen transactions, including both the Fund’s and its predecessor’s investments.
The Fund’s senior investment team is comprised of co-head Jeffrey Ferrell, Founder and Managing Partner of Athyrium Capital Management; co-head Samuel Porat, Managing Director at NB Alternatives; and Laurent Hermouet and Richard Pines, Partners at Athyrium Capital Management.
“Client response to the Athyrium Opportunities Fund has been high and we’re thankful for the trust our investors have placed in us,” said Samuel Porat, co-head of the Fund. “Our aim is to create a diversified portfolio of investments that can generate relatively high current income while also offering a level of downside protection commensurate with fixed income investments.”
The Fund’s global investor base is comprised of more than 35 institutional investors, including public and private pensions, insurance companies, funds-of-funds, endowments and foundations.
“Small- and medium-sized companies often have limited access to the capital markets and other sources of financing, and the Athyrium Opportunities Fund offers these companies an attractive alternative for their capital needs while limiting potential equity dilution,” said Jeffrey Ferrell, co-head of the Fund. “Our goal is to customize capital solutions that meet our investment objectives while providing flexible and creative capital solutions to the industry. Our investment team has its roots in the private equity business and this informs how we approach our relationship with portfolio company management.”
