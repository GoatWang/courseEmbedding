BIGELOW’S COLLABORATIVE TEAM
We are not privileged; we are not entitled. We succeed only when our clients do.











 



 
















One Unique Collaborative Team
We strive to be the best M&A advisory firm exclusively focused on our target niche: advising Entrepreneur Owner-Managers to achieve their personal and professional goals by first building, and then someday capturing their Enterprise Value in a capital gain transaction. We do this by operating as a unique collaborative team of experienced professionals leveraging our individual strengths and collective experience.
We have developed our proprietary “swarm” strategy, where—unlike our bureaucratic competitors whose teams are made up of junior people usually relegated to specific roles in industry silos—we approach each new client engagement with a collaborative team of senior experienced professionals who have complementary functional skills and creative strengths.
We intentionally work only with a select number of clients each year. Candidly, this allows us to concentrate all of our Team’s energy, creativity, and talent on a few clients to whom we bring great value. Because we succeed only when our clients do, our “skin is in the game” — big time. We personally research, negotiate, and manage all aspects of every engagement, and pride ourselves on building long-term, mutually rewarding relationships that transcend mere transactions.

The VIA Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) is a psychological assessment measure designed to identify an individual’s profile of character strengths. It was created by Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman, two of the most well-known thought leaders in the field of Positive Psychology. With this knowledge, individuals can begin to capitalize and build upon their particular strengths. Bigelow’s Unique Team has been assembled specifically to leverage our individual unique strengths and collective experiences. Employing the VIA has been a valuable tool to allow us to identify and appreciate our diverse signature strengths.

 The ART OF CAPTURING VALUEARD is a global leader in providing consulting services to developing countries in the fields of agriculture, governance, infrastructure, energy, environment, and natural resources. ARD’s strategic acquisition by Tetra Tech (NASDAQ-TTEK) gave the founder the freedom to move on to his “next chapter” as a philanthropist, which he had planned for years. Read the ARD case study… 


FIRM PROFILE: A Proud History of INDEPENDENCE
Founded in 1935, Bigelow LLC is independently owned by our Managing Directors—unlike the large, diversified financial firms with whom we compete. Our only source of revenue is from our clients, and we thrive at having our own capital at risk.




Vast & Diverse EXPERIENCE





At Bigelow LLC, we exclusively advise Entrepreneur Owner-Managers who have highly successful businesses. Together we focus on two challenges: How do I create meaningful enterprise value? Someday, how do I capture that enterprise value in a capital gain transaction?





Over the past several years, we have closed over $3 billion in transactions ranging in size from $30 to $350 million. We believe in the discipline of weaving together diverse experiences, earned from numerous industries, to unlock inventive strategies that prove beneficial for Bigelow clients.





Unique COLLABORATIVE Team





Because we are independently owned and agnostic as to industry, we are conflict-free. We are career-long practitioners of our craft who leverage our unique individual strengths into a collaborative team that has worked together on client engagements for an average of almost 20 years.
Our exceptional skills in value creation, combined with our team “swarm” methodology, enhance the value capture process.





We recognize that the qualitative fit of the next investment partner is vital to our clients. We honor the fact that the bottom line isn’t always everything.
Ours is not a “one-size-fits-all” commoditized process. We approach each client engagement with creativity and flexibility – developing adaptive solutions rooted in a clear understanding of each client’s goals, values, and industry.





Performance BEYOND the Expected





Clients frequently tell us that we surpassed their valuation expectations. We are committed to successfully structuring the ownership transition only to the right investor, for the right reasons.





At Bigelow LLC, we believe in being held accountable for our work. We share our clients’ risk through the mechanism of success fee compensation. We appreciate the compensation that results from our willingness to be highly “at risk” with our clients.


“Independent”— A small, privately owned business. Not Subject to another’s authority or jurisdiction.



Our VALUES
We build long-term, mutually rewarding relationships that transcend transactions.
We behave as owners.
We tell the truth, quickly and candidly, even if it hurts. We always have parallel interests with our clients, with no ulterior motives.




“Bigelow not only had the functional capability, they had the track record and demonstrated capability to execute. Looking back at the transaction, Bigelow always put the client first. They displayed honesty, great integrity, and a team with exceptionally intertwined professional skill sets.”
Edward W. Cronin Jr.
President & CIO

Worrell, Peter R. Enterprise Value: How the Best Owner-Managers Build Their Fortune, Capture Their Company’s Gains, and Create Their Legacy. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2014.
Worrell’s first book is written for seasoned, successful Entrepreneur Owner-Managers who are thinking about the long term sustainability of their organizations, beyond their personal ownership of it. It is constructed on the theoretical foundations of corporate finance and positive psychology, but is informed and flavored with entertaining real-life, first-person stories that illustrate its lessons about ownership and management succession. Worrell serves as an expert coach, employing humor and insight as he recounts the struggles of large numbers of owner-managers who, with Bigelow’s guidance, have successfully handed off their beloved businesses to the best next majority investors…and created a fortune in doing so. Worrell even divulges a bit of Bigelow’s unique secret sauce, teaching strategies for dealing successfully with the Seller Beware in the Private Transaction Market, how to leverage industry drivers to build Enterprise Value, and how best to find the “needle in the haystack” best fit investors to create positive legacy. The book showcases the contributions of these Entrepreneur Owner-Managers, and reveals what Worrell terms the genius of the pro-social benefits they bring to employees, customers, and all stakeholders in their communities.

We Seek to LEARN From One Another





Our Shared Purpose: We collectively deepen our understanding of these unique and often challenging entrepreneur business owners. We are active participants sharing expertise for the purpose of exploring some of our common experiences and issues.
Method: A candid, vigorous dialogue; we learn from one another, and from the outside perspectives of leading experts.





Intended Outcome: An enhanced group of relationships with owner-managers and their expert advisors. Having made a deposit in our intellectual capital bank, we add new cognitive and financial tools to our toolbox making us more effective with our mutual clients.
Reward: Together, we enjoy a stimulating exchange of perspectives and ideas among our colleagues and friends – in a spectacularly beautiful setting.





The Case of the UNCERTAIN Entrepreneur – Video Case Study





In order to collaborate with other advisors to owner-managers and create a Community that better understands their unique perspectives, Bigelow LLC has created a video case study that showcases the unique situations owner-managers bring to the table when contemplating the sale of their business.





In this video, the stage is set for a typical Bigelow meeting with an Entrepreneur Owner-Manager (Shannon) who is contemplating the sale of her business. Common issues are raised about current Management structure and needs, family ownership concerns, valuation ambiguity, juxtaposed against Shannon’s personal goals and ambitions outside of the business.

Nancy B. Gardiner, Esq.

 The ART OF CAPTURING VALUEDearborn Precision Tubular Products’ proprietary methods effectively serve multiple end-markets for its high-precision tubular and rotating metal components manufacturing business. The acquisition by Hunting PLC was structured creatively, allowing the existing parters to “carve-out” and keep a small tube material tolling operation. Read the Dearborn Precision Tubular Products case study… 


Our PHILOSOPHY: Not a Cookie-Cutter APPROACH
At Bigelow, we first advise our owner-manager clients on value creation strategies, and then attain the highest achievable values for them through recapitalization or divestiture. We are known for our willingness to invest the time, active listening, and empathy required to satisfy the objectives of multiple stakeholders. It is not a cookie-cutter approach. It takes a lot of energy and time spent understanding the specific circumstances of each owner-managed business.
Starting the “Someday” CONVERSATION
At Bigelow, we are able to think like outside investors — so we can give you objective insight into how others will view and value your company. We welcome the opportunity to discuss with you the steps you are taking or need to take in order to ensure that your enterprise will receive the highest valuation possible in three to five years time.





Proprietary Process for Building & CAPTURING VALUE
Bigelow LLC’s proprietary process is flexible but formal. We maximize confidentiality through staged disclosure of information and we relentlessly manage the process to a successful closing. The process involves:




Building Enterprise Value

Assess and evaluate the industry, timing, attractiveness, and key characteristics including competitive dynamics
Refine company strategy in light of industry drivers
Identify key company characteristics such as concentration risk
Segment customers and products to evaluate potential opportunities
Size addressable market utilizing company information and third party reports
Craft a strategic planning process, if necessary, to enable management to develop an actionable growth plan
Identify dashboard of business metrics to measure performance
Initiate focused return on invested capital planning
Discuss management evolution — the right managers in the right roles
Advise on critical areas of diligence to perform in advance of a someday transaction
Monitor and advise on company metrics to stakeholders





Capturing Enterprise Value

Assess and build consensus among stakeholders on the strategic alternatives
Assess the industry characteristics, company strategy, and competitive dynamics
Build upon your existing advisory team to create a world-class mergers & acquisitions team
Develop the next best investor’s growth “story”
Search worldwide for the best strategic or financial investor
Position the company to optimize its market value
Evaluate many potential candidates; proceed with a select few
Customize the approach to each investor based on unique investor “hot buttons”
Create company descriptive information, shared through technology enabled platform (no “book”)
Orchestrate investor meetings
Populate a confidential online data room to share company information with investors
Negotiate and structure the transaction for the best price, terms, and conditions






Our value-capturing process utilizes the latest research tools and web-based technology to streamline and accelerate information flow.





“I admire Bigelow LLC’s attention to detail, professionalism, and flexibility. They had a good feel for the industry, used the right comparative companies and got up to speed quickly. While some of our Board members were completely focused on capturing the financial value of the company, I always placed more value on getting the right partner. I wanted to make sure the company would go forward in the right direction. Bigelow LLC succeeded in satisfying everyone – Board members, employees, and investors.”
William P. Duncan, Ph.D.
President, Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute, Inc.
Member of Board of Directors Phoenix Scientific, Inc.




“Our discussions with clients frequently begin years before a liquidity event. In fact, we regularly meet with owner-managers who are interested in building value in their enterprises so that they may capture it someday down the road.”
