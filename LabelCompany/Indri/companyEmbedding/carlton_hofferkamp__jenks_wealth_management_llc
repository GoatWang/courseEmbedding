Retirement
Planning







It is not unusual to learn individuals entering or nearing retirement often cite “losing their nest egg/savings” as their number one fear.
We believe the number one goal in retirement planning is to ensure you don’t “outlive your money”.
At Carlton, Hofferkamp and Jenks we believe in straight talk, period. A retirement plan must first and foremost be realistic and achievable. We start with straight talk about budgeting and living within your means to ensure your retirement assets have ample time to grow and keep up with inflation.




Through our discovery and planning process we help you chart a course to a comfortable and stress free retirement.
Next, we implement an investment strategy specifically tailored for you – providing for short term needs and allowing your nest egg to grow to meet your goals for a long and healthy retirement.

Political Stock Rally
Home
  Political Stock Rally










September 27, 2016September 28, 2016 


Friends
For those of you with strong political convictions, don’t blame me, but today’s narrative on Wall Street was that stocks were buoyed by the belief that Hillary Clinton won last night’s debate. The feeling is that Hillary brings more of the same, and that is better than whatever it is that Donald Trump might bring. Basically it’s better the devil you know, or simply put, markets do not like the unknown. Hillary is a known, Trump is an unknown. Ok, enough of the political market interpretations.
After some early seesaw action, stocks rose nicely and held the gains in the final hour of trading. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 133 points to finish the day at 18,228. The S&P 500 was up 13 points to close at 2,159. Gold was down $13 to trade at $1,330 per ounce, while oil was down $1.39 to trade at $44.54 per barrel WTI.
Once again, in contrast to what happened in August, we have seen a lot of volatility in September which comes to a close on Friday. Amazingly, despite all the volatility, the S&P is down only fractionally for the month at the moment. So like August, we seem to be ending in the same spot, but September’s ride has been a lot more interesting.
Have a nice evening everyone.

Mixed Earnings Day



July 21, 2017July 24, 2017 


 

Friends It was a tale of two industrial giants as Honeywell and GE faced off this morning with earnings releases. Honeywell was the clear winner and has been for quite some time now. GE on the other hand has struggled mightily over the past several years. Perhaps if outgoing... Continue reading





Natural Response To Earnings Today



July 20, 2017July 24, 2017 


 

Friends Stocks were quiet today except for Home Depot , Lowes, Best Buy and Whirlpool  which were under siege after Amazon (yes, them again) announced a deal with Sears to sell Kenmore appliances online. Other than that, there was little direction and muted volatility. By the close, the Dow... Continue reading





Stocks Forge Ahead



July 19, 2017July 24, 2017 


 

Friends The earnings parade continues and stocks reacted positively today. Morgan Stanley led the way with good numbers, but we did have one stinker as IBM held the Dow back with a less than stellar report. Despite Big Blue’s drag on the Dow, stocks still forged ahead to new... Continue reading





Stocks Recover To End Mixed



July 18, 2017July 24, 2017 


 

Friends Stocks sold off early in the trading session with the Dow down more than 150 points, but did recover to eliminate most of the damage. Goldman Sachs alone accounted for much of the drop in the Dow. Both the aforementioned Goldman and Bank of America had earnings releases... Continue reading





A Big Week Of Earnings



July 17, 2017July 24, 2017 


 

Friends It was a quiet beginning to the trading week, but things should pick up as earnings start to roll out this week starting with Netflix after the close today. Throughout the week we’ll see reports from the likes of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Lockheed... Continue reading





Stocks Rally Despite Lackluster Economic Data



July 14, 2017July 24, 2017 


 

Friends Despite a weak retail sales number and a benign CPI number (remember the Fed wants some inflation), stocks enjoyed a surprisingly good day. It was a broad based advance with a lot of green all over my screen. Ironically, despite good earnings from JP Morgan, Citi and Wells... Continue reading





Quiet Day/Stocks With Modest Gains



July 13, 2017July 20, 2017 


 

Friends Stocks experienced a somewhat quiet day with a slight upward bias. Market participants are gearing up for earnings season with big banks Citi, J P Morgan and Wells Fargo reporting tomorrow. In other news, retailers other than Amazon finally had a good day fueled by Target’s comments that... Continue reading





A Yellen Rally



July 12, 2017July 20, 2017 


 

Friends Another good day for stocks and Nasdaq in particular. The momentum stocks led the way, but we saw broad participation across the board. Helping the cause was Janet Yellen’s more dovish testimony before Congress. Once again, the Fed Chair indicated that the Fed is not locked into any... Continue reading





Stocks React To Headlines-Then Recover



July 11, 2017July 20, 2017 


 

Friends It was an interesting day of trading in the markets as a very quiet morning turned into a slightly frantic midday move when Donald Trump Jr. tweeted and released emails concerning his meeting with a Russian “attorney” who had supposed political information last year. The algorithms quickly turned... Continue reading





Naz Continues To Seesaw



July 7, 2017July 11, 2017 


 

Friends  While Putin and Trump huddled in Hamburg, likely discussing Ringo Starr’s 77th birthday, stocks continued the seesaw action that we have seen for the past week. Once again, the Nasdaq reversed its previous day’s move leading the way to the upside (today up more than 1%). Perhaps market... Continue reading

Retirement
Planning







It is not unusual to learn individuals entering or nearing retirement often cite “losing their nest egg/savings” as their number one fear.
We believe the number one goal in retirement planning is to ensure you don’t “outlive your money”.
At Carlton, Hofferkamp and Jenks we believe in straight talk, period. A retirement plan must first and foremost be realistic and achievable. We start with straight talk about budgeting and living within your means to ensure your retirement assets have ample time to grow and keep up with inflation.




Through our discovery and planning process we help you chart a course to a comfortable and stress free retirement.
Next, we implement an investment strategy specifically tailored for you – providing for short term needs and allowing your nest egg to grow to meet your goals for a long and healthy retirement.
