(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.  Liquidity  The Fund's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering. Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the three months ended June 30, 2014 or on working capital reserves,  The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee. Fund management fees accrued during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 were $1,238,949 and total fund management fees accrued as of June 30, 2014 were $49,750,945.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Fund receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships that will be used to satisfy these liabilities.

  and the related
  Production
     Units that make

     Conveyance or
Memorandum   and

for
     each Accepted

the county real  
property   records
in
     the county where
each Accepted Well is located prior to the commencement of

Payment of   $1,328,427.00   for the   Evaluation   Wells and the first six

8
<PAGE>
 
Price Payment shall be reduced by an amount
equal to all NPI Payments that would
have been due and payable to the NPI
Purchaser   through the
Initial Closing Date
assuming that the   Conveyance   covering the Initial   Bundle had been made to the
NPI   Purchaser   effective   on the date of   commencement   of   production   of each
Accepted Well included in the Initial
Bundle.
 
         
(b)   The   amount   of the   Purchase   Price   Payment   agreed   to be paid
     pursuant to the
applicable   Purchase
  Supplement shall be
billed to the NPI
     Purchaser by the
Company as final AFE's for each Accepted Well are approved
     by the
  Company on or before
the 15th   calendar
  day of each month (or,
  if
     such day is not
a Business   Day,
  the next   succeeding   Business   Day) (the
     "Invoice
  Date").   NPI Purchaser will make each
payment of a Purchase Price
     Payment (or any
portion thereof) within 5 Business Days of the Invoice Date
     by wire
  transfer   of   immediately   available   funds to such banks and bank
     accounts
  as   the   Company   shall   specify   in   the    applicable    Purchase
     Supplement.
  As the Company
  accrues   actual   Total Well   Construction   and
     Completion
  Costs for an Accepted
  Well,   the Company   will, on the Invoice
     Date following
such accrual of actual costs, provide the NPI Purchaser of a
     reconciliation
  of amounts
  reflected in the AFE
for each Accepted Well for
     which the NPI
Purchaser has  
previously   made a
Purchase   Price Payment
and
     the actual Total
Well   Construction
  and Completion Costs
for such Accepted
     Well. To the
extent that the actual Total Well   Construction and Completion
     Costs for an
Accepted Well exceed the amounts reflected in the AFE, the NPI
     Purchaser
  will,   subject to Section   2.5(c) pay its portion of the
excess;
     and, to the
extent that the actual Total Well   Construction   and Completion
     Costs for an
Accepted Well are less than the amounts   reflected in the AFE,
     the Company will
refund to the NPI Purchaser the amounts overpaid.   The NPI
     Purchaser and
the Company agree that any such overpayments or underpayments
     will be
reflected on the invoice   provided to the NPI Purchaser on
the next
     succeeding
Invoice Date that follows 90 days after first production from
an
     Accepted Well by
decreasing,   or
  increasing,
  the amount billed to
the NPI
     Purchaser.
  Not withstanding the
preceding sentence, any of the Parties may
     elect in
writing,   in lieu of
offsetting any  
overpayment   or
  underpayment
     against amounts
billed on the next Invoice Date, to have the Company refund
     any
overpayments, or the NPI Purchaser to make any underpayments,
  within 5
     Business
  Days   of   the   Invoice   Date   on   which   such    overpayments    or
     underpayments
are reflected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
     to such banks
and bank accounts as the Company, or the NPI Purchaser, shall
     specify in the
applicable Purchase Supplement or in such written request.
 
         
(c) In addition to the  
limitations   on the
amount Red Oak is required
     to expend on any
  Accepted   Bundle   pursuant to Section   4.3.1 of the JVEA,
     which limits
shall also be deemed to limit the maximum   aggregate   Purchase
     Price
  Payments (net of any
NPI Payments as described in the JVEA) that NPI
     Purchaser
  is required to make
with   respect to any
  Accepted   Bundle,   NPI
     Purchaser
  shall   not be   obligated   to pay   Total   Well   Construction   and
     Completion
  Costs   that   exceed   the   lesser   of (i) 130% of the   estimates
     reflected on the
AFE's for an Accepted Well, or (ii) $3,500,000.00.   If the
     Total Well
  Construction and
Completion Costs for an Accepted Bundle exceed
     the   limits   specified   in   Section   4.3.1   of the JVEA or the   Total   Well
     Construction and
Completion Costs for an Accepted Well exceed the estimates
     reflected
  on the   respective   AFE by more   than   30% or are in   excess   of
     $3,500,000.00,
  and NPI   Purchaser   elects not to fund any
  portion of such
 
 
                                      
9
<PAGE>
 
     excess, then
such event, NPI Purchaser's   aggregate Net Profits Interest
in
     such
  Accepted   Bundle or   Accepted   Well   shall be less than 25%,
  and NPI
     Purchaser's
  Percentage in that
  Accepted Well or
Accepted   Bundle shall
be
     determined in
accordance with Section 1.23 of the JVEA.
 
         
(d) Under no circumstances shall NPI Purchaser be liable to Company
or
     any   Third   Party   for   the   payment   of   any   portion   of the   Total   Well
     Construction
  and   Completion   Costs.   It is the   agreement   of the Parties
     hereto
  that   NPI   Purchaser   shall   (to   the   extent   otherwise   specified
     hereunder)
  purchase   the Net   Profits   Interest by making   Purchase   Price
     Payments
  in   amounts   which may be   determined,   among   other   things,   by
     reference
  to   documented   and   verifiable   Total   Well    Construction   and
     Completion
  Costs,   but that Company (and not NPI
Purchaser) is responsible
     for paying all
the Total Well Construction and Completion Costs.
 
         
(e) The amount of all  
Purchase   Price
  Payments   paid to the   Company
     shall be reduced
by 3.25% as provided in the   Engagement   Letter   ("Red Oak
     Payment").
  The Red Oak
  Payment   shall be paid by MBG and
  MBGV   Partition
     directly to Red
Oak by (i) wiring 2.25% of the   Purchaser   Price Payment to
     the account
  specified by Red Oak
at the time the Purchase Price Payment is
     paid to the
Company,   and (ii)
directing the Company to reduce MBG and MBGV
     Partition's
  collective
  25% Net   Profits   Interest to a 24.75% Net
Profits
     Interest
  and to convey,
  pursuant   to the   Conveyance,   a .25% Net Profits
     Interest to Red
Oak. For all other  
purposes of this  
Agreement,  
including
     calculating the
Net Profits Interest, the Red Oak Payment will be deemed to
     constitute part
of the Purchase Price Payments. Red Oak will be entitled to
     the Conveyance
of the Net Profits Interest specified in this Section 2.5(e)
     and the rights
of an NPI   Purchaser
  under   Sections   3.1, 3.2, and 6.1(a),
     (c), (d), (e),
(g), (h), (i), and (k),   through (p) of this Agreement,
  and
     subject to the
  obligations
  of an NPI Purchaser
  under Section 3.3 of
this
     Agreement,
  but will not be
  required   to pay any   portion of the   Purchase
     Price Payments
or any other amounts pursuant to this Agreement and does not
     have any rights
to terminate this  
Agreement   pursuant to
Article VII other
     than with
respect to itself.

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PETD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

CALGARY, June 27, 2017 /CNW/ - Crown Capital Partners Inc. ("Crown" or "the Corporation") (TSX: CRWN), which provides growth capital to successful mid-market companies, today announced the closing of a $25 million term loan (the "Agreement") with Ferus Inc. ("Ferus"). 
Headquartered in Calgary, Ferus provides a dedicated supply of energized fluids (liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon dioxide), as well as the related logistical and operational services to deliver those products and frac sand to customers in the energy industry. The company is the leading provider of industrial gases to the Canadian energy market where its products are integral to the energized hydraulic fracturing process. Ferus has the strategic advantage of owning and operating the complete supply chain, from gas production through to last-mile delivery. The company has six strategically located production plants and maintains a logistics fleet as well as network of specialty wellsite storage units to facilitate the efficient delivery of essential fracturing inputs. Crown's term loan will be used to repay Ferus' existing senior credit facility and to support Ferus' growth objectives.
"Ferus is a leader in its field with a blue-chip client base and key assets throughout the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin," said Chris Johnson, Crown's President & CEO. "While the oil and gas industry has been faced with challenges through this cyclical downturn, the company is poised to capitalize on a sector recovery and the continued trend of longer horizontal wells with additional frac stages, which is expected to drive increased demand for Ferus' integrated product offering in the coming years." 
"We look forward to working with Crown as we capitalize on the shift to higher intensity fracs and 'last-mile' logistics for hydraulic fracturing. With a Calgary base and other investments in the sector, Crown is an ideal partner to support Ferus at this stage of our business," said Dick Brown, President & CEO of Ferus.
The Agreement provides for a $25 million term loan to Ferus by Crown Capital Fund IV, LP, an investment fund managed by Crown and in which Crown holds a 35% interest. 
ABOUT CROWN
Crown (TSX: CRWN) is a specialty finance company focused on providing capital to successful Canadian and select U.S. companies that are unwilling or unable to obtain suitable financing from traditional capital providers such as banks and private equity funds. Crown also manages capital pools, including some in which Crown has a direct ownership interest. Crown originates, structures and provides tailored special situation and long-term financing solutions to a diversified group of private and public mid-market companies in the form of loans, royalties and other structures with minimal or no ownership dilution.

*Periods under 1 year are not annualized ¹Bid/Ask Midpoint as of market close. ²Reflects partial calendar year 5/8/2012-12/31/2012.³"Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" reflect the fund's pro rata share of the indirect fees and expenses incurred by investing in one or more acquired funds, such as mutual funds, business development companies, or other pooled investment vehicles. Acquired fund fees and expenses are reflected in the prices of the acquired funds and thus included in the total returns of the fund. 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance data quoted here represents past performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
ArrowShares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Index returns are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual fund performance. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Total returns for the periods since inception are calculated from the inception date of the fund. "Average annualized total returns" represent the average annual change in value of an investment over the period indicated. "Cumulative total returns" represent the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. ET when NAV is normally determined for most ArrowShares, and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

Export distributions


Distribution Schedule (PDF) 19a-1 Filing (Distribution Source Estimate) GYLD Annual Tax Source Information*Income/Other and Total Distribution may include income, dividends, return of capital, or other forms of payment. Return of capital is considered a return of the investment principal and is not derived from net profits. 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance data quoted here represents past performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.  
Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions. There is no guarantee a distribution will occur. Shares of funds are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Glossary of Terms

Export historical NAV/Market Price










*Bid/Ask Midpoint as of market close. NAV and Market Price are usually calculated at 4:00 p.m. ET. Please refer to the ArrowShare's prospectus for more details on NAV determination. Description The above chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the ArrowShare and the ArrowShare's net asset value. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the ArrowShare's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 p.m. ET). The vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed as a percentage of NAV. The horizontal axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the ArrowShare traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the NAV and the trading price of ArrowShare shares through arbitrage opportunities, there is no guarantee that they will do so. Why is there a difference between NAV and Market Price? A major reason for the difference is that timing discrepancies can exist between the NAV and Market Price (Bid/Ask Midpoint) reported above. Information is constantly flowing to and among investors, corporations, and financial institutions that affects their outlook on the financial markets and the value of securities. This process, known as price discovery, is why market prices change and evolve throughout the trading day. It is important to note that even when markets are closed, the price discovery process continues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Possible Timing Discrepancies: 

Close of Trading Times: The NAV of the ArrowShares normally is calculated using prices as of 4:00 p.m. ET. Each ArrowShare normally trades on its respective stock exchange until 4:00 p.m. ET.
Time of Last Trade: Trading generally takes place throughout the normal trading hours for ArrowShares on the listing exchange on which it is listed (generally 9:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. ET). At times, many trades are placed in rapid succession. At other times, little or no trading activity is taking place. It is important to note that the date/time of the last trade (which is recorded as the Closing Price) may not take place at exactly 4:00 p.m. ET when the ArrowShares normally calculate NAV. The date/time of the last trade sometimes may occur before 4:00 p.m. ET. Thus, ongoing price discovery may result in a deviation between the price recorded as the Closing Price and the NAV of the ArrowShare shares calculated at 4:00 p.m. ET. Therefore ArrowShares generally reports market price as the bid/ask midpoint at or near market close.
