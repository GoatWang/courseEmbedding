The History...
OF A MODERN DAY SUCCESS







History

More than a century ago, the American experience, for many, came to life when the railroads opened up a nation, linking people and products north, south, east and west, to power an economy ready to go global.
For many in America’s southeast, it meant the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, now part of the CSX system, that weathered wars, depressions and catastrophic acts of nature and put Florida on the map.
From this heritage, a new enterprise was born…setting in motion an economic surge in citrus and cattle, sugarcane and forestry, oil exploration and water management.
Operating at first out of a historic Florida courthouse, the Atlantic Land Improvement Company’s “South Florida Project” was soon creating waves of change in a land abundant in resource but limited in direction.
Sound management and vision from the parent company provided that direction.  Then, in 1960, Alico was born, a public company decidedly invested in the promise of private enterprise.
Alico’s fortunes grew -- led by a future Hall of Fame citrus pioneer and businessman, Ben Hill Griffin, Jr. who at one point was listed by Forbes as one of America’s richest. Although lands were originally acquired to produce timber for the railroads, the operation quickly diversified into:
Cattle. Citrus. Sugarcane. Sod. Mining.
This led to expansion of holdings, record citrus harvests, and a new strategic imperative to evaluate assets and opportunity on the basis of best and highest use.
Today, Alico is an American agribusiness leader, known for its expertise in citrus, conservation and rural-based commodities.
Today, Alico, more than ever, is looking to expand its reach and deepen its edge by:

Optimizing yield through management and innovation.
Minimizing risk with enhanced economic forecasting.
Focusing on conservation to promote good citizenship…and long-term community support.

Alico’s management team is dedicated to superior results through research, innovation and operational efficiency.
Alico is an American legacy…built for today’s world.

History[edit]
Alico, Inc., originally known as the Atlantic Land and Improvement Company, was founded in 1898 as a subsidiary of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and was the holding company for its real estate division.[3] In February 1960, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (now part of CSX Transportation) spun-off the Atlantic Land and Improvement Company, which was then renamed Alico (an acronym for Atlantic Land and Improvement Company).
In 1961, Ben Hill Griffin, Jr. was named to the board of directors of Alico, Inc, which then became a publicly traded corporation engaged in citrus fruit, sugarcane and sod production, cattle ranching and forestry.[4] Griffin acquired a majority of the outstanding stock of Alico in 1972, and became chairman of its board of directors in 1973.[5]
Griffin, Jr. passed away in 1990 and was succeeded by his son Ben Hill Griffin III. Griffin III would go on to donate 760 acres of the company's land in South Fort Myers to the state for the construction of Florida Gulf Coast University. The road leading to the university and one of its academic halls are named for Griffin, and its basketball arena is named Alico Arena.[6]
Lobbying[edit]
As of 2015, the company employed 14 lobbyists to work with Florida's legislative and executive branch, spending between $80,000 and $150,000 for lobbying efforts in the first quarter of 2014.[7]
Water farming[edit]
Alico has allocated aboout 27% of their 122,000 acres for water farming.[8]
