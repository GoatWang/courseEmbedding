Job Details
               Company Size: $5 mil to less than $10 mil - Employee Range: Less than 25. THOMASVILLE - Many things have changed about Dozier Hardware since it came into existence over a century ago. Originally, it was located downtown; now it sits out on the four-lane. There have also been changes in the folks who have worked there and the ones who have run the business but one thing hasn't changed and it's the thing current company president Gerald Corgill credits with allowing the business to survive over the last 10 decades. "This is a service-based business," Corgill said. "That's what has allowed us to stay around for so long and I think it's the reason this business has been successful. I know it's something my father-in-law took very seriously and something he always brought up when we talked about business. His father-in-law, Billy Andrews, told Corgill every customer was important and the business needed to do whatever it could to keep the customers satisfied. "He told me over 31 years ago that every hardware store in town carried about the same thing at about the same price," Corgill said. "Mr. Billy said the thing that set us apart was service. He believed in treating everyone the same, whether they were a big contractor coming in to spend thousands of dollars or whether they were folks working on the weekend projects, who might only need a $5 part. Corgill said the store's reputation was built on service and on dealing with folks honestly and with integrity. "That philosophy hasn't changed," Corgill said. " We do our best to keep our customers satisfied and I think that has built up a lot of loyalty to the store.".
