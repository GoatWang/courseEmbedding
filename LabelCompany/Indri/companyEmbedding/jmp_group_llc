 The Dividend Dogs Rule Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More specifically, these are, in fact, best called "underdogs". 

 July MoPay Dividend Dog Data  Three monthly pay stock lists produced numerous actionable conclusions and several more unnumbered issues. To draw these conclusions and issues, June 30 closing prices and estimated annual dividends were referenced. Monthly pay (MoPay) equity (1) yield and (2) upside potential lists were combined and refined into (3) the top net-gain equities per broker targets plus dividends less fees list shown above. Monthly Pay Dividend Qualities Quarterly, semiannual and annual dividend investors anxiously await announcements from a firm, fund, or brokerage to learn if their next dividend will be higher, lower, or paid at all. Monthly pay stocks, funds, trusts, and partnerships inform the holder every four and one third weeks by check and/or statement. If the entity reduces or suspends a payment, the holder can sell out of the investment immediately to cut future losses. This advantage has been curtailed when companies suddenly cut monthly dividends to save cash. Some 2017 examples were: Three prominent MoPay firms declared dividend cuttings between December 2016 and March 2017. First, Five Oaks Investment Corp (OAKS) declared a cut from $.06 to $.05 per month December 27. Second, February 9, Fifth Street Finance Corporation (FSC) declared a decrease from $0.06 to $0.02 in March but thereafter paying the $0. 02 Quarterly. Simultaneously, sister firm, Fifth Street Floating Rate Corp. (FSFR) declared a cut from $0.075 per month down to $0.04 for March and thereafter paying $0.19 quarterly beginning in June. Top yield dog for October, 2016, Orchid Island Capital (ORC) released this cautionary note with its monthly dividend announcements, "The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future." The MoPay segment is volatile.
 Readers said:  "[A] problem with this analysis is you are comparing companies of VERY different varieties. REITs pay no taxes and their distributions are classified as ordinary income and thus not subject to the 15% or 20% tax rate. MLPs also pay little no taxes at the corporate level, but instead have "distributions"... Comparing REITs, MLPs and regular corporations thus requires a financial analysis...not include[d]." --arbtrdr "[Y]ou list a few issues here whose distributions are rife with RETURN OF CAPTAL [ROC] at its most destructive form, funds that pay you back your own money each and every month in their distributions with no regard to what they truly earn...- these should not be included in any list containing the word "dividend". --NYer1 "I can enter or exit a position and still reap dividends for at least 2/3s of the quarter. They also smooth the income stream so I have cash at any given time to make a purchase at dips." --Ed Invests "Dividend dog investing really works well for income in my experience. I have been seriously invested in dogs the more unloved the better." --Urbannek "...Nice to see another contrarian strategy. This one seems to take a lot of attention in comparison [to Dow dogs], but I like the monthly rebalance." --colodude "At this level of risk, I'm only buying monthly dividend payers.

As long as [my sin stock] continues to pay and raise the dividend like it has for 16 years now, it will have a spot in my portfolio." --Miz Magic DiviDogs "One thing to point out: These stocks are not buy & hold. If you buy any of these stocks, set a price where you will sell... trailing stops work real good & with mopays you can get out & get back in without losing a whole quarter of dividends..." --drking "I don't know how many times I've kicked myself for not investing in a beaten down group only to find it spring back up months later." --User 13258352
 List One US Monthly Pay Dividend Equities Over 3.5% Yield 

 Top ten of these US exchange listed monthly pay dividend equities showing the best yields into July represented just three of the eleven Morningstar market sectors, with representative firms of 5 from real estate, 4 from the financial services sector, and 1 from energy. Top dog for July was one of the five real estate representatives, Orchid Island Capital (ORC) [1], a stalwart in the MoPay kennel. The remaining four real estate sector stocks filled slots, three, six, nine, and ten: Five Oaks Investment Corp. (OAKS) [3]; AGNC Investment (AGNC) [6]; Whitestone (WSR) [9]; ARMOUR Residential REIT (ARR) [10]. Next, four financial sector dogs placed second, fourth, seventh, and eighth: Prospect Capital Corporation (PSEC) [2]; Capitala Finance (CPTA) [4]; Stellus Capital Investment (SCM) [7]; Canoe EIT Income Fund (OTC:ENDTF) [8]. To complete the July MoPay top ten dog list by yield, a lone energy issue placed fifth, Enduro Royalty Trust (NDRO) [5]. List Two: Monthly Pay Dividend Stocks by Price Upside 

 Results from YCharts for MoPay dividend stocks as of market closing price June 30 were compared with analyst mean target prices one year out as reported by YahooFinance. Ten top stocks displayed 6.9% to 43.44% price upsides for the next year based on analyst 1 yr. targets. Five stocks of ten (tinted) on this price upside list were members of the top ten list by yield. One of those top upside performers by yield made this upside list in the first place: Five Oaks Investment (OAKS) [1]. The other four top yielders showed in the third through fifth, and seventh places, Enduro Royalty Trust (NDRO) [3], Whitestone (WSR) [4], Capitala Finance (CPTA) [5], and Orchid Island Capital (ORC) [7].
 Five firms outside the top ten by yield placed second, sixth, and in the eighth through tenth slots by price upsides: Bluerock Residential (BRG) [6]; Student Transportation (STB) [8]; Gladstone Commercial (GOOD) [9]; Solar Senior Capital (SUNS) [10]. Price upside, of course, was defined as the difference between the current price and analyst target one-year median price for each stock. Those ten MoPay stocks showing the highest upside price potential into 2018 were gleaned from 30 selected by yield. Three to nine analysts have historically provided the most accurate mean target price estimates. 

 Actionable Conclusions: Wall St. Analysts Estimated (11) A 6.3% 1 yr. Average Upside And (12) A 14.09% Net Gain Net Gain For Top 30 July MoPay Stocks Top dogs on the MoPay stock list were graphed above to compare relative strengths by dividend and price as of June 30, 2017 with those projected by analyst mean price target estimates to the same date in 2018. Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $10,000 invested as $1K in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those ten stocks created the data points applied to 2017. Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from $1000 invested in the ten highest yielding stocks and aggregate one year analyst mean target prices as reported by Yahoo Finance created the 2018 data points in blue for dividend and green for price. Note: one year target prices from one analyst were generally not applied (n/a). Analysts projected a 5.4% lower dividend from $10K invested as $1k in the top ten July MoPay dogs while aggregate single share price was projected to increase by 3.8% in the coming year.
 The number of analysts contributing to the mean target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the above chart. Three to nine analysts were considered optimal for a valid projection estimate. Estimates provided by one analyst were usually not applied (n/a). A beta (risk) ranking for each stock was provided in the far right column. A beta of 1 meant the stock's price would move with the market. Less than 1 showed lower than market movement. Higher than 1 showed greater than market movement. A negative beta number indicated the degree of a stock price movement opposed to market direction. Dog Metrics Revealed Good Gains From Five Lowest Priced High Yield MoPay Equities Ten monthly pay stock equities were culled by yield. These results, verified by YCharts and YahooFinance, produced the following rankings. 

 Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Estimated 5 Lowest Priced of Top Ten Highest Yield MoPay Dividend Stocks  Will Produce (13) 24.45% VS. (14) 19.81% Net Gains from All Ten by July, 2018 

 A sum of $5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest priced stocks of the top ten MoPay dividend dog kennel by yield was predicted by analyst 1 year targets to deliver 23.4% more net gain than $5,000 invested as $.5k in all ten. The second lowest priced MoPay dividend dog, Five Oaks Investment (OAKS), was predicted to deliver the best net gain of 53.74%. 


 Lowest priced five MoPay dividend dogs estimated June 30 were: Enduro Royalty Trust; Five Oaks Investment; Prospect Capital; Canoe EIT Income Fund; Orchid Island Capital Inc, with prices ranging from $3.25 to $9.86. Higher priced five MoPay dividend dogs estimated June 30 were: Whitestone (WSR); Capitala Finance (CPTA); Stellus Capital Investment (SCM); AGNC Investment; ARMOUR Residential REIT, whose prices ranged from $12.25 to $25.00. This distinction between five low priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflects the "basic method" Michael B. O'Higgins employed for beating the Dow. The same technique, you now see, can also be used to find some rewarding dogs in the MoPay Stock kennel. The added scale of projected gains based on analyst targets contributed a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here and now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Its also the work analysts got paid big bucks to do. Caution is advised, however, as analysts are historically 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and about 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of the change.

Investor 5 Cap Realty, along with affiliate RREIC Advisors, has launched a multi-year national investment program that could exceed $1 billion in assets under management. The companies have entered in a joint venture, along with a private equity fund managed by JMP Group’s asset management division. The new partnership will focus on purchasing and operating value-add residential properties that can undergo extensive renovations and can be leased and managed to create superior risk-adjusted returns. In keeping with the aforementioned strategy, the joint venture closed on its first two acquisitions, two residential communities totaling 446 units. The properties located in Philadelphia and Atlanta traded for almost $60 million.
“There are a lot of undermanaged assets in the marketplace. Our team has demonstrated throughout its history that we can identify these assets and reposition them with better management, marketing, and capital improvements. Our plan is to build a billion-dollar multifamily investment platform.  Over the next five years, we are targeting the acquisition of ten properties per year, each with 200-300 units, focusing on the nation’s top 50-60 markets,” David Reiner, managing director of RREIC Advisors, said in prepared remarks.
Summer Chase
The 198-unit community located at 100 Hunsberger Drive in Limerick, Pa., was acquired for $36.3 million from an institutional seller. The property’s unit mix consists of one-, two- and three- floor plans averaging 996 square feet. The community features amenities such as a fitness center, a clubhouse, a business center, a swimming pool and 200 parking stalls. The asset was 91.4 percent occupied as of May 2017, according to Yardi Matrix. The venture also revealed plans to invest $2.5 million in upgrades to the kitchens, bathrooms and to the HVAC system.
Grove Mountain Park
Located at 1900 Glenn Club Drive in Stone Mountain, Ga., the 268-unit community traded for $21.6 million. The 13-building garden-style property offers a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans averaging 827 square feet. The community also features waterscape, a fitness center, a playground, a swimming pool and 600 parking stalls. At the time of the deal, the asset was at 99.6 percent occupancy. The venture plans to invest $3.2 million in renovations to the common areas and to the individual units.
Debt financing for the acquisition of both properties was provided by Fannie Mae. 5 Cap’s affiliate Forty Two LLC will be taking over management assignment for all of the venture’s acquisitions.

   2017 Small-Cap Biotech Watchlist Update: Up 21% at the End of Q2/17 :: CountingPips          CountingPipsForex & Financial TradingForex NewsBlogOpinionsNewswireChartsCalendarAppsSearch 14 Jul 2017 2017 Small-Cap Biotech Watchlist Update: Up 21% at the End of Q2/17By The Life Science ReportSource: Streetwise Reports   07/13/2017If an investor had purchased an equal dollar amount of each company on The Life Sciences Report’s 2017 Small-Cap Biotech Watchlist at the beginning of the year, that portfolio would show a gain of about 21% as of July. This is primarily due to the performance of a handful of companies that have been moving their assets farther down the development pipeline, according to the analysts who follow them.Overall, as of July 12, ten Watchlist companies show gains for the first half, and the other ten show losses. Biotechs on the Watchlist for 2017 were selected by three analysts at the Biotech Showcase in January.Leading the pack is Pieris Pharmaceuticals Inc. (PIRS:NASDAQ), which was selected by Watchlist panelist and JMP Securities analyst Michael King. The company is up ~306% in the first half of 2017.Free Reports: Get our Weekly Commitment of Traders Report: - See where the biggest traders (Hedge Funds and Commercial Hedgers) are positioned in the futures markets on a weekly basis.

We believe the asthma and immuno-oncology markets provide significant value to the Pieris pipeline and that management has the ability to deliver on this promising technology.”Pieris stock is currently trading at ~$6 per share.Loxo Oncology Inc. (LOXO:NASDAQ) had posted an overall gain of ~142% over the first half of the year. In a June 5 research report, JMP Securities’ King, who placed the company on the Watchlist, wrote, “Loxo Oncology announced striking data across all three ongoing clinical trials of larotrectinib (LOXO-101) in patients with tumors harboring tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusions at ASCO (the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting).”In his comments, King stated, “Given the impressive activity of larotrectinib and in a highly specific target patient population, as well as its Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD), we anticipate its rapid approval by the FDA with commercial launch taking place shortly thereafter in 2018.”JMP raised its target price for Loxo from $53 per share to $71. The stock currently trades at ~$76 per share.“We believe investing in LOXO represents an investment in a modern model of the oncology drug development company,” King concluded.Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (ABEO:NASDAQ) was selected for the Biotech Watchlist by two of the analysts, Raghuram (Ram) Selvaraju of Rodman&Renshaw, and George Zavoico of JonesTrading Institutional Services. Abeona stock has logged an ~80% increase since the first of the year.Commented on the company’s Q1/17 results in a May 17 research report, Selvaraju noted that Abeona’s “cash position remains strong.” The analyst also made note of a number of catalysts, some that have been achieved, and some that can be anticipated.“Abeona’s most advanced candidate, has been accorded Fast Track designation from the FDA as well as Orphan Drug designation in both the U.S. and Europe,” Selvaraju stated. “This program in Sanfilippo Syndrome A (MPS IIIA) would be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) as well. Abeona has secured Orphan Drug designation in the European Union for its second pipeline candidate, ABO-101, for MPS IIIB and for ABO-201 in Juvenile Batten Disease. ABO-201 could enter the clinic early next year.” In addition, the company’s “epidermolysis bullosa program remains on track with incremental positive data presented.”Abeona stock is currently trading at ~$9 per share.Blueprint Medicines Corp. (BPMC:NASDAQ) ranks just above Abeona in terms of percent increase over the first half, logging in at ~85%.Selected for the Watchlist by King, in a June 5 research report the analyst commented on the company’s recent announcement of “positive updated data from its ongoing Phase I clinical trial of BLU-285 in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and plans to pursue expedited development in patients with a PDGFRα D842V mutation.” King also noted that Bluesprint has announced FDA approval of breakthrough therapy designation for BLU-285, and “plans to pursue expedited development of BLU-285 in this patient population.”Reflecting on the company’s “products, platform [and] personnel,” King wrote, “Blueprint Medicines brings all of the elements together for a highly successful and sustainable discovery-based biotechnology company that will benefit patients with its compounds and investors with returns on its shares. We remain confident that BPMC shares will accrete as we are presented with compelling data from the company’s trials of BLU-258 and BLU-554. In anticipation of the success with BPMC’s two lead programs, we believe investors will also attribute a higher likelihood of success to the company’s pipeline prospects.”The other top-five gainer on the Watchlist is another King pick: Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SNDX:NASDAQ). The company has posted a six-month gain of ~81%.In a June 5 research report, JMP’s King, who placed this company on the Watchlist, commented on progress on its Phase 1b/2 ENCORE 601 trial “investigating the combination of entinostat, the company’s lead asset and selective HDAC inhibitor, plus Keytruda (pembrolizumab [MRK, NC]), an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with melanoma, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.”JMP believes “Syndax represents a rare investment opportunity in the small cap oncology space.” King also noted that “entinostat [has] already demonstrated a meaningful benefit in both progression-free and overall survival in a large tumor category (metastatic breast cancer). In addition to its demonstrated clinical benefit, entinostat has also received breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) from the FDA. . .With such a robust asset under development, we believe Syndax could potentially clear regulatory hurdles to rapidly translate its preclinical and clinical success with entinostat into a marketed therapy.”Other companies on the 2017 Small-Cap Biotech Watchlist include:· Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Style Scores:



C Value | F Growth | C Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
