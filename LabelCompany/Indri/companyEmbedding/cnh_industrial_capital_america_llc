Employment Contract ScamIn March 2016, CNH Industrial became aware of false job offers in circulation from entities posing as our company and brands. The scam asked for personal or financial information from job seekers. These communications were not from CNH Industrial or anyone authorized to communicate on its behalf. Nor are any of the associated documents actual or legitimate CNH Industrial documents. We would like to reiterate that CNH Industrial only accepts applications via the tools mentioned in the region sections above.The CNH Industrial career tools will not require you to provide your financial information, nor will it ask you to sign a “contract” if you have not already applied through the website and spoken with an authorized representative. Any CNH Industrial-authorized representative will gladly give you a return phone number or email address so that you can confirm their authenticity if you have any questions about whether a communication you have received is legitimate.

CNH Industrial America, LLC and CNH Capital America, LLC Sued for U.S. Antitrust Violations, Fraud, and Conspiracy in Financial Tying Arrangement
Dec 9 16
CNH Industrial America, LLC and CNH Capital America, LLC, have been sued for conspiring to monopolize portions of the U.S. agricultural wholesale equipment market and otherwise unduly terminate dealers in an allegedly unlawful wholesale financing tying arrangement. CNH Industrial sued for U.S. Antitrust Violations, Fraud, and Conspiracy in Forced Financial Tying Arrangement. The lawsuit, filed in the District Court of Oklahoma by New Holland dealer Wootton New Holland, LLC alleges that CNH Industrial and CNH Capital conspired to unlawfully perpetrate a scheme of fraud to circumvent The Fair Practices of Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers, and Dealers Act of Oklahoma. Specifically, the complaint alleges that CNH INDUSTRIAL and CNH CAPITAL acted to constructively and unlawfully terminate New Holland Brand Dealer Agreements by extinguishing lines of credit in an alleged "arm's length" manner, while subsequently refusing to sell products and services to dealers on a cash basis or through other lenders. The complaint also alleges that the CNH Companies engaged in this conduct all while refusing to accept payment for orders in an effort to unlawfully retain payments due and owing to the dealers in order to reduce their own risk. The complaint further alleges that CNH Capital's sole reason for existence is to circumvent dealer fair treatment statutes existing nationwide in the U.S. The Plaintiff further alleges that CNH Industrial requires all dealers to purchase financing from CNH Capital at above market rates as a condition of sale and maintaining its dealer status with CNH Industrial. The complaint further explains the alleged tying arrangement in that CNH Capital's own representatives have testified before this Court as follows: Capital is wholly owned by and is under the exclusive control of CNH Industrial America. Both entities are wholly owned by and under the exclusive control of CNH Industrial, NV. Every New Holland and Case dealer in the United States - more than 1,000 dealers in total - is required to execute a wholesale financing and security agreement with CNH Capital in order to enter into a dealer agreement with CNH Industrial. CNH Industrial does not, in the ordinary course of its business, accept payment from any party other than CNH Capital. The matter has also been referred to the Attorney General of The United States and is currently pending.

History[edit]
CNH Industrial N.V. was incorporated in November 2012 and became operational at the end of September 2013 following the integration of Fiat Industrial S.p.A. and CNH Global.
N.V. Fiat Industrial, a global leader in the capital goods sector, was created on January 1, 2011 through the demerger of CNH, Iveco and FPT Industrial from Fiat Group. However subsequently FPT Industrial was taken over/merged into CNH.
One of the top players worldwide in the agricultural and construction equipment sectors, CNH was created in November 1999 through the merger of New Holland N.V. and Case Corporation.[4]
The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on Borsa Italiana: it is a constituent of the FTSE MIB index.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
