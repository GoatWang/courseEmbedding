						i have a p5a-b rev 1.03 (manual only lists up to 350 Mhz).  
i bought a 500 mhz k6-2.  when i looked at the multiplier settings, there were only two jumpers on the three sets of pins, so i tried 6x and 83 mhz bus.  the bios (1.008) figured it out at 500 mhz, but i got a &quot;windows protection
error-need to restart computer&quot;  and windows 95 (950 B) wouldn't load. the same thing happened at 3.5x100.  i put it back to 3x100 and it loaded.  has anyone been able to push that board up to 500? or is it windows??  any suggestions?  i could try to find a third jumper and try 5x100.

						Although I have a different mobo, I would try the 5x100 setting. My K6-2 500 won't boot at any setting other than 5x100.

								a firearm as an assault weapon the receiver spur focuses on one key characteristic, as detailed below.  								
							

								Click here to view the NYSAFE features presentation to see any images or descriptions to aid in diagnosing your firearm.
							









What is The Spur?

								The spur is a Nylon 6/6 injection molded component that can be used to replace a protruding pistol grip on an AR-15 rifle.  This durable piece will not absorb solvents or oils commonly found around firearms increasing the durability of the spur.  
								This component is custom molded by S & B Products Inc., a company built with the sportsman in mind.  S & B has leveraged the knowledge of a law enforcement officer with over 30 years of experience to create a product that will allow 
								sportsmen with a specific firearm to try to conform to the guidelines set forth by the SAFE Act.

Understanding the SAFE Act

						The NYSAFE Act has impacted the landscape of firearm ownership, this act in particular has greatly impacted the owners of AR rifles in NYS and more specifically those looking to own an AR in the State of New York.  Below are the criteria by which a firearm falls under the SAFE Act, if the sole criteria governing your firearm is the one below the stars then the Receiver Spur is a viable solution.
					






"Does the firearm have a folding or telescoping stock?"








"Does the firearm have a protruding pistol grip?"




"Does the firearm have a thumbhole stock?"




"Does the firearm have a second handgrip or a protruding pistol grip that can be utilized by the non-shooting hand?"






"Does the firearm have a bayonet mount?"




"Does the firearm have a flash surpressor?"




"Does the firearm have a muzzle break?"




"Does the firearm have a grenade launcher?"






"Does the firearm have a threaded barrel to accommodate flash surpression or muzzle breaks?"
































































You've got questions, we've got answers

						Below are some of the most commonly asked questions associated with the receiver spur and where it stands with respect to the NYS Safe Act.
					







Does the receiver spur need to be permanently attached to an AR-15 rifle?





								No, the receiver spur is a permanently modified part that cannot be turned into a pistol grip.  The NYSAFE Act states that modifications to remove certain features is permissible.
							





Will the spur fit the AR-10?





								Yes, The Spur does fit the AR-10 and functions properly. However, aesthetically there is a small gap at the back of The Spur where it meets the gun.
							





Will it help with the SAFE Act?





								We have not received anything in writing from NYS. We are currently pressing the State for an official written determination. We are confident the AR15 Receiver Spur does not run afoul of the law. Our attorney assures us we have not misrepresented our product or what it accomplishes. The NY Safe Act permits modifications to remove design characteristics that define a rifle as an assault weapon.
							





Has NYS ruled on the spur yet?





								Short answer is NO, nothing in writing from NYS yet. Every "lawful authority" State and Local we have conferred with has assured us the AR-15 Receiver Spur DOES NOT run afoul of the law. We are going to continue to press the State for a written determination. I spent 30 years in law enforcement and I am confident this modification relieves the rifle from the assault weapon definition if the pistol grip is the sole characteristic.

First of all, leaving the EU gives us back control of our trade policy... We can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do them quickly.  I would expect the new Prime Minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 monthsThe flood of new regulation from Europe will be halted... There is also a political, or perhaps sentimental point. The great British industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. I am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights. This is in any event unnecessary, and we can significantly improve our growth rate by stopping the flood of unnecessary market and product regulation. We should also continue with the programme of lessening the tax burden.The ideal outcome is continued tariff-free access. Once the European nations realise that we are not going to budge on control of our borders, they will want to talk, in their own interest.  There may be some complexities about rules of origin and narrowly-based regulatory compliance for exports into the EU, but that is all manageable. We should work out what we do in the improbable event of the EU taking a dog in the manger attitude to Single Market tariff free access, and insist on WTO rules and levies, including 10 per cent levies on car exports. Let us be clear: I do not believe for a moment that that will happen, but let us humour the pre-referendum Treasury fantasy.So how will this look if we get it right?  We will have a more dynamic economy, trading throughout the world.  Our businesses will have greater global opportunities, and will be more competitive. There will be lower prices in the shops, once we are outside the Common External Tariff.  There will be higher wages for the poorest.  An immigration system that allows us to control numbers.  Control of our laws, so our lives are not hampered by needless and restrictive regulations.This approach should allow us to present to the British electorate in 2020 the early fruits of a successful global trade-based economic strategy as we build our place in the world.

Burt,Davies is a very able man, but he will fail to brexit in the way ye want.May has used him wisely.Funy thing, the thing that LEAVERS wanted was less IMMIGRATION,  and may has appointed a young remainer for the jiob that is supposed to tackle that. Amber will fail, just like her predecessors: IMMIGRATION will not fall till the economy declines further.tons       is bullish about the economy.However, she mentions the borders.Do ye think ye will need to build a wall across our land , and, possibly, around Dover/Folkestone?

TonsI am not keen on Davies' politics but at least he has no stain on his character like Liam Fox. He is sharp enough and maybe he will,be trusted by negotiating partners. From aTory point of view at least he looks a good appointment.But Liam Fox was so mired in sleaze from Werrittygate it makes her first cabinet smell terrible.At least Tony Blair's promise to have a government unsullied by sleaze lasted longer than 10 minutes!Theresa seems to have dumped the difficluty of negotiating brexit with those who fought for it. Maybe there is a bit of her showing to them to be careful what they wished for!

He's started off by saying we'll negotiate with Germany for cars, with France for food and wine and with Italy for fashion.Firstly, I don't think he quite understands how negotiating with the EU works. Might want to brush up on that.Secondly, has he been taking tips from Johnson? What next, look for deals with Holland for their clogs, with Belgium for chocolate, Spain for maracas, Ireland for drunkenness.

Slightly different. The Irelands re-uniting wouldn't make much diference to EU membership... the Republic would still be the Republic, albeit a bit bigger. Just like a bit of volcanic action throwing up a new bit of land off Trallee. It would automaticaly be part of RoI and therefore a member of the EU. Scotland though? Problems there, I think, as current EU rulings don't allow for break away areas of the EU to be accepted into the EU club. I think Spain put that bit in to prevent Catalunya and the Basque region from doing a bunk and staying in the EU via the old "we're already in so we may as well stay" argument. The Scots would have have to apply in their own right, accept the Euro currency and kiss goodbye to UK dosh. I think Brexit would be a darn sight easier than Scottish Scentrance. Could you honestly envisage the EU funding Scottish free higher education, free travel entitlement cards, free prescriptions, free health care for the over 65's, etc, etc.

This time next year, with Article 50 still not enacted, David Davis is going to look a bit silly, given that he promised Brexit starting by the end of this year. But that is nothing compared to the relentless pressure he will be under when Article50 kicks off. My worry is that David Davis is 67 now, he'll be in his seventies when the process nears completion.

Sean, how many of the gangs working at night on roads and building sites do you think have NI cards? A farmer friend of mine was asked to take delivery of a load of supplies at a very early hour of the morning and discovered that none of the workers in the production plant or the truck drivers were registered workers. Many work at night and sleep in rented houses or mobile homes by day. The black economy is alive and well and probably explains why the productivity and production figures don't tally with the economics activity. I can't say how widespread this is, but I suspect it is far higher than most of us realise. Brexit won't stop this of course but at least we can sell new products to any other country we wish to without putting our hand up and saying please sir to a Bureaucrat in Brussels. Just ask James Dyson.
