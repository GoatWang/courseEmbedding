Company History - Hivelocity HostingSAVE UP TO 20% WHEN YOU PREPAY!Our Company
                    To provide the ultimate user experience through exceptional 
                    customer service, flawless reliability and extraordinary innovation.
                Home/About/Our Company
                        Hivelocity was founded in 2002 by a few guys with a single mission to create an exceptional company with a singular focus on simplifying hosting. Starting with a rack of servers located in the quintessential basement, (every great start-up story starts in a basement or garage after all) our vision was to build a hosting company that not only supported customer growth but fostered it as well. The credo back then, as it is today, was the more successful our customers are, the more successful we will be. Hivelocity’s goal has always been to do whatever possible, whenever possible to put our customers in the best position to succeed, with the simple hope that success would eventually lead to needing more servers.
                    
                        This philosophy of taking a vested interest in each customer’s success worked just as we had hoped and over time our shared hosting customers began requesting dedicated servers to satisfy their growing resource needs. Hivelocity quickly outgrew that old server closet, moved out of that dingy basement and now owns and operates over 60,000 square feet of data space across the southeast where it provides a full spectrum of cloud and hosting services. Today Hivelocity provides dedicated servers, colocation and cloud hosting solutions to thousands of businesses from over 130 countries around the world. We are the home to over 10,000 servers and have the infrastructure in place to accommodate 10,000 more.
                    
                        Through all of the growth and all of the added service offerings our mission has never changed; provide our customers with a solution and environment that puts them in the best position to succeed. To us this means providing incredibly reliable solutions that allow our customers to focus on running their business. It means providing a level of customer service and support that far exceeds your expectations. It means always considering the customer’s user experience first in everything we do and offer. Lastly, it means doing all of these things at a price point that enables your business to flourish.
                    
                        Hivelocity is a privately held company that employs 50 of the best people in the business. Every day we deploy bare-metal servers built to your exact specifications, virtual servers and both public and private cloud hosted solutions. Our data centers maintain compliance for HIPAA, PCI and an SSAE-16 certification. We offer our colocated customers 24/7 private and secure access to their locking cabinets within our facility. Today Hivelocity provides a wide range of bleeding edge solutions and software for thousands of businesses big and small.
                    
                I've been using Hivelocity.net for my dedicated servers since 2008 and I am satisfied. Their price, and speed of support is unbeatable.

Frequently Asked Questions About Our ServicesHome Frequently Asked Questions About Our Services









Request Job Estimate





Question 1: Why is cleaning the entire kitchen exhaust system important?Answer:  Cleaning the entire system is important because flammable substances like grease can contaminate ductwork throughout the system. Maintaining a clean kitchen exhaust system free of grease is a risk mitigation strategy. Exhaust systems are designed to contain a fire for 1 – 2 hours, depending on the size of the building and local fire codes. Thus, the amount of grease build-up that is acceptable and not considered a major fire safety hazard can be traced back to the amount of time it would take the grease build-up to burn off throughout the entire system. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Standard 96 is the governing body for kitchen exhaust cleaning frequencies and provides a guide for determining the acceptable number of days a system can go between cleanings. The BARE METAL STANDARD® Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Service process sets each of your systems on a predictable rotating cleaning schedule. Upon the completion of each service cleaning, the risk is thus mitigated (cleaned).
Consult your local BARE METAL STANDARD® office to receive additional information on your kitchen exhaust system and how we can help keep it up to code and fire safe.



Question 2: What exactly do you clean during a typical job?Answer: The BARE METAL STANDARD® cleaning process is specially designed to clean grease out of the interior of exhaust systems. This includes the vent hoods from the filter tray up to the plenum and into the connecting ductwork. Some systems have minimal amounts of ductwork, creating a simple system to service. However, the exact same hood installed in a different building could have extensive lengths of ductwork. In both cases, the complete system would be the hood, all connecting ductwork included, and the fan. The pricing would then be different due to the large difference in connecting ductwork. The most challenging prospect when investigating a system, one which we are specially trained to discover and explain, is the complexity of an exhaust system usually hidden from view. After all, when standing in two example kitchens, they can have identical canopies (hoods) and identical cooking equipment under them but have vastly different duct lengths. Everyone can agree that cleaning one 3-foot duct is very different from cleaning one 172-foot duct with multiple twists and turns.
 



Question 3: How often does my system need to be cleaned?Answer: There are 5 influencers to this question:

Insurance requirements (guidance from NFPA 96 Chapter 11)
Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) enforcement procedures (guidance from portions of NFPA 96 that have been adopted by the AHJ’s)
Type of cooking equipment
Your menu and cooking times
Design of the grease exhaust system

The key to answering this question is to work closely with your BARE METAL STANDARD® service professionals. As a guideline for the minimum cleaning frequencies you can reference NFPA 96 Table 11.4: Schedule of Inspection for Grease Buildup.
Table 11.4 Schedule of Inspection for Grease Buildup




Type or Volume of Cooking


Inspection Frequency



Systems serving solid fuel cooking operations

Monthly



Systems serving high-volume cooking operations, such as 24-hour cooking, charbroiling, or wok cooking

Quarterly



Systems serving low-volume cooking operations

Semiannually



Systems serving low-volume cooking operations, such as churches, day camps, seasonal businesses, or senior lefts

Annually




In kitchens with multiple and independent kitchen exhaust systems, it is common to have each system on its own cleaning schedule. For example, a steam hood will have a different rotation than a broiler. However, a solid fuel broiler will have a different rotation than a gas fired broiler.
*If your kitchen exhaust service company is not asking you questions about your menu, kitchen design, and insurance requirements, you may not be getting the coverage necessary to remain in compliance with the AHJ and/or your insurance carrier. Don’t let noncompliance result in fines and/or uncovered losses.



Question 4: Will I need to schedule each appointment for cleaning?Answer: We know that our customers have a business to run, so we’ve invested in developing scheduling software that allows our BARE METAL STANDARD® professionals to proactively contact each customer prior to their recurring service dates. This means that your BARE METAL STANDARD® service professionals are notified of upcoming cleaning dates and we will contact you – prior to the due date – to set-up an acceptable time for service.
Additionally, our scheduling software records your service history for you. You can always request this information from your BARE METAL STANDARD® service professional and then give it to your insurance company and/or your AHJ. Below you’ll find the recommended cleaning schedule, according NFPA 96.

Quarterly



Systems serving low-volume cooking operations

Semiannually



Systems serving low-volume cooking operations, such as churches, day camps, seasonal businesses, or senior lefts

Annually







Question 5: Will the rest of my kitchen be left clean?Answer: Your kitchen will be returned to you in the condition we received it. Our BARE METAL STANDARD® service professionals will be trained and provided with the tools necessary to contain all of our cleaning activity. Our policy is to cover up all of your work surfaces, mop our footprints out and leave filters in the negotiated location. (Filters may or may not be cleaned depending on the SOW agreement between the BARE METAL STANDARD® service professional and each customer).

The market for our services is intensely and increasingly competitive and
subject to rapidly changing cleaning technology and evolving standards. In
addition, many companies in our target market are offering, or may soon offer,
products and services that may compete with our services. Our current primary
competitors generally fall into two categories: large companies and small one
man operations. We expect competition to increase as other established and
emerging companies enter the market, as customer requirements evolve and as new
products and cleaning technologies are introduced.
 
Many of our competitors, particularly large companies, have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution,
professional services or other resources and greater name recognition than we
do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with our
potential customers and extensive knowledge of the industry. As a result, they
may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging customers and changes in
customer requirements. Increased competition may lead to price cuts, alternative
pricing structures or the introduction of products and services available for
free or a nominal price. We may not be able to compete successfully against
current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and
financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive
pressures.
 
Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of
factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include
ease and speed of service deployment and use, an, performance and scalability,
the quality and reliability of our customer service and support, total cost of
ownership, return on investment for the customer. Any failure by us to compete
successfully in any one of these or other areas will adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Moreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or
establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing
so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our
potential customers. In addition, our prospective indirect sales channel
partners may establish cooperative relationships with our competitors.


Company Description
Bare Metal Standard was incorporated in the State of Idaho on November 12, 2015.
The Company was formed to engage in the business of commercial kitchen grease 
exhaust system cleaning. The Company seeks to develop synergistic business 
franchises which provide services to restaurants, health care


 industry, prisons
and schools throughout the United States.
 
We intend to provide franchise opportunities in the service of commercial
kitchen grease exhaust systems. We will support our franchises through a
centralized workflow system developed by us. The application is capable of
managing hundreds of franchises and thousands of potential customers’ locations
throughout the United States.
 
Our business model is designed around five business units:
 
. management services,

. equipment manufacturing and leasing,

. government/public affairs,

. strategic partnerships,

. branding.

Management Services – This is franchisee supportive services associated with the
day – to – day support our franchisee expect from us to ensure they are properly
utilizing the technology we provide to franchisees to run their businesses.
These services will vary from franchisee to franchisee depending on the size and
level of knowledge of each franchisee.
 
Government/Public Affairs – Utilizing our affiliates we will assist the
franchisee in navigating the local, state and at time federal regulations that
drive customer compliance for the services we offer. Our business is regulated
by fire code and with experience in this industry we are the thought leaders in
our industry we will have an active team educating local, state and federal
authorities as to the benefits of our system over alternatives. This team will
also work with insurance carriers to help educate adjusters, agents and property
owners.
 
Equipment manufacturing and leasing – Our business requires our franchisee to
purchase service vehicles from us. We will develop relationships with auto
manufactures and custom build shops to ensure we can deliver the best product
and prices available to our franchisee. We anticipate leveraging our buying
power for equipment and vehicles, and we will analyses the best locations to
perform assembly of our systems into two major distributions centers in the
United States.
 
Strategic Partnerships – One of the driving forces to us building a public
company is to generate the capital to build a national network of franchisees
that can service customers. They want to select Bare Metal Standard as the
exclusive national provider, however, we must establish a National network of
Franchisees to provide our services. We will have a team of 4-5 regional
representatives that will be responsible for cultivating and ensuring the
penitration of these strategic partnerships / customers.
 
Branding – Building a national brand will take hiring the best PR firm in
Franchising. When someone decides to buy a franchise we must have the branding
relationships with brokers in ever region in the USA to ensure we get the best
franchisees available to run our businesses. Thus, Branding will consist of both
building Broker relationships through the strength of a strong showing in
franchise circles managed by a PR Firm to be selected.

                Easily manage all your domains with myVelocity’s hosted DNS manager.  Supports SOA, NS, A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, and SRV records.
            Network Layer Intrusion Detection System
                We protect our customers by constantly monitoring our network for signatures of malicious activity such as port scanning and brute force, DOS, TCP, UDP and ICMP based attacks.  Automated mitigation tactics are triggered once an attack is detected blocking the source IP from our network.  Optional enterprise grade DDoS protection plans with packet scrubbing are also available.
            IPv6 Support
                IPv6 is included and fully supported.

                Setup and manage your free cloud storage within the myVelocity portal.  Additional cloud storage can be added for just $.20 per GB.  Check out our knowledgebase for articles and videos detailing how to utilize this storage for backup of your server and server files.
            Free Inbound Bandwidth
                All of your inbound bandwidth is free and not measured against the transfer included with each server.
            99.99% Uptime SLA
                While we have a proven track record of 100% network and power uptime for years, we guarantee 99.99% and will compensate you with service credits if we ever fall short of that.
            24/7 Phone, Chat & Ticket Support(Hablamos Español)Our technical support team is located on-site at the data center that hosts your server and is available to assist you all day every day.  We can provide you with technical support in English or Spanish. Both Public & Private VLAN Networks
                All servers include a public VLAN for inbound and outbound traffic, in addition to a 1Gbps private VLAN network for intra-datacenter connections.  This private network is utilized when accessing data center services like cloud storage and daily backups.    These 2 networks are in addition to the out-of-band management network for IPMI access.
            Server Hardening Upon Deployment
                Upon server deployment we ensure your OS is hardened and updates are applied.
            Bandwidth Reporting
                Within the myVelocity portal customers are provided detailed bandwidth reports that show both inbound and outbound throughput.  Usage data can be graphed by the month, week, day or down to the hour.
            Intelligently Routed Blend of 7 Transit Providers
                The Hivelocity network consists of an intelligently routed blend of Level 3, TWTC, CenturyLink, NTT, Cogent, Seabone & XO transit.   We enhance our network performance with the use of specialized software (Noction) that adds a layer of intelligence to our routing.  In short, our intelligent routing protocol chooses the absolute fastest path available enabling us to reduce jitter and improve over 20,000 routes per day over standard BGP.  Our incredible global network performance is just one reason we have customers in over 130 countries.
            Peering with AWS, Microsoft, Google and More
                We further improve our already incredible network by establishing peering points of presence in strategic regions of the country and with specific organizations that our customers commonly interact with.  We currently have peering points established in Miami, Atlanta and Los Angeles enabling us to control network destinations and shorten hops once data hits those locations.  Additionally our network is directly peered with organizations like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Charter, Cox Communications, Hurricane Electric and over 300 more similar entities allowing us to optimize network performance between our network and theirs.
            Free Private Traffic Between Multiple Servers & Data Centers
                Each Hivelocity server is outfitted with at least 3 network interfaces.  1.  Public network 2.  Private network.  3. IPMI access.  Our private network allows us to cross-connect multiple servers within the data center.  This service is provided free of charge.  Additionally, each of our data centers is connected with a point to point private network allowing servers across different facilities to communicate free of charge.

                                            How long does it take a new dedicated server to deploy?
                                        Although we state our fully customized servers go online within 24 hours the reality is most of them are deployed within just 4 hours from the time we receive payment. We offer a handful of pre-built, pre-configured servers that deploy in about 7 minutes.
                                            Can I customize your dedicated servers however I want?
                                         Any of our “non-instant” dedicated servers can be customized however you want with thousands of possible options.  We provide options from one processor to four processors, one hard drive to 100 hard drives, 8GB RAM to 1000GB RAM, and everything in between.  Most fully customized servers deploy in less than 4 hours from the time we receive your payment.
                                            What configuration options do I have with an Instant Deployment server?
                                         Instant Deployment servers are pre-built and already racked up within the data center.   Customization options are limited to the operating system, software, bandwidth and add-ons like firewalls and backups.  There are no options to customize the hardware. Instant Deployment servers typically deploy in about 7 minutes from the time your payment is submitted.
                                            What is included with a 1Gbps unmetered port?
                                        We provide a full 1Gbps dedicated port that you can max out whenever you need, for as long as you need.  You are connected to the same Intelligently Routed blend of 7 transit providers included with our standard metered bandwidth options.  You will never be billed for overage with this plan unless you have specially requested a 10Gbps port, otherwise, you are capped at 1Gbps.  If you were to max out this port for the duration of an entire month you would experience roughly 330TB of throughput.
                                            What kind of RAID options do you offer?
                                        We provide hardware based RAID with far superior reliability and performance than software based RAID solutions. After you have selected a second hard drive in your cart, RAID 1, 5 and 10 options will be presented. 
                                            Do you offer server management?
                                        Each server can have our proactive Managed Services by on-site technicians added to it.  Information about this service can be found on our Managed Services page.
                                            Can I upgrade my dedicated server later?
                                        Upgrade to a better CPU, more RAM, more hard drives quickly and easily at the time of your convenience.  Open a trouble ticket with our Sales Team for pricing of the upgraded hardware and on acceptance we will coordinate with you to determine the best time to perform the upgrade.
                                            Do you outsource your technical support?
                                         We do not outsource our technical support.  When you call, live chat or correspond with us via a trouble ticket you can be assured that you are working with a Hivelocity employee on-site in our data centers.
                                            Do you accept Bitcoin?
                                        Yes, we happily accept bitcoin payments.  You will need to open a live chat or speak to one of our Sales Representatives over the phone to establish this payment method with us.

                                            How long does it take a new dedicated server to deploy?
                                        Although we state our fully customized servers go online within 24 hours the reality is most of them are deployed within just 4 hours from the time we receive payment. We offer a handful of pre-built, pre-configured servers that deploy in about 7 minutes.
                                            Can I customize your dedicated servers however I want?
                                         Any of our “non-instant” dedicated servers can be customized however you want with thousands of possible options.  We provide options from one processor to four processors, one hard drive to 100 hard drives, 8GB RAM to 1000GB RAM, and everything in between.  Most fully customized servers deploy in less than 4 hours from the time we receive your payment.
                                            What configuration options do I have with an Instant Deployment server?
                                         Instant Deployment servers are pre-built and already racked up within the data center.   Customization options are limited to the operating system, software, bandwidth and add-ons like firewalls and backups.  There are no options to customize the hardware. Instant Deployment servers typically deploy in about 7 minutes from the time your payment is submitted.
                                            What is included with a 1Gbps unmetered port?
                                        We provide a full 1Gbps dedicated port that you can max out whenever you need, for as long as you need.  You are connected to the same Intelligently Routed blend of 7 transit providers included with our standard metered bandwidth options.  You will never be billed for overage with this plan unless you have specially requested a 10Gbps port, otherwise, you are capped at 1Gbps.  If you were to max out this port for the duration of an entire month you would experience roughly 330TB of throughput.
                                            What kind of RAID options do you offer?
                                        We provide hardware based RAID with far superior reliability and performance than software based RAID solutions. After you have selected a second hard drive in your cart, RAID 1, 5 and 10 options will be presented. 
                                            Do you offer server management?
                                        Each server can have our proactive Managed Services by on-site technicians added to it.  Information about this service can be found on our Managed Services page.
                                            Can I upgrade my dedicated server later?
                                        Upgrade to a better CPU, more RAM, more hard drives quickly and easily at the time of your convenience.  Open a trouble ticket with our Sales Team for pricing of the upgraded hardware and on acceptance we will coordinate with you to determine the best time to perform the upgrade.
                                            Do you outsource your technical support?
                                         We do not outsource our technical support.  When you call, live chat or correspond with us via a trouble ticket you can be assured that you are working with a Hivelocity employee on-site in our data centers.
                                            Do you accept Bitcoin?
                                        Yes, we happily accept bitcoin payments.  You will need to open a live chat or speak to one of our Sales Representatives over the phone to establish this payment method with us.

                    To provide the ultimate user experience through exceptional 
                    customer service, flawless reliability and extraordinary innovation.
                Home/About/Our Company
                        Hivelocity was founded in 2002 by a few guys with a single mission to create an exceptional company with a singular focus on simplifying hosting. Starting with a rack of servers located in the quintessential basement, (every great start-up story starts in a basement or garage after all) our vision was to build a hosting company that not only supported customer growth but fostered it as well. The credo back then, as it is today, was the more successful our customers are, the more successful we will be. Hivelocity’s goal has always been to do whatever possible, whenever possible to put our customers in the best position to succeed, with the simple hope that success would eventually lead to needing more servers.
                    
                        This philosophy of taking a vested interest in each customer’s success worked just as we had hoped and over time our shared hosting customers began requesting dedicated servers to satisfy their growing resource needs. Hivelocity quickly outgrew that old server closet, moved out of that dingy basement and now owns and operates over 60,000 square feet of data space across the southeast where it provides a full spectrum of cloud and hosting services. Today Hivelocity provides dedicated servers, colocation and cloud hosting solutions to thousands of businesses from over 130 countries around the world. We are the home to over 10,000 servers and have the infrastructure in place to accommodate 10,000 more.
                    
                        Through all of the growth and all of the added service offerings our mission has never changed; provide our customers with a solution and environment that puts them in the best position to succeed. To us this means providing incredibly reliable solutions that allow our customers to focus on running their business. It means providing a level of customer service and support that far exceeds your expectations. It means always considering the customer’s user experience first in everything we do and offer. Lastly, it means doing all of these things at a price point that enables your business to flourish.
                    
                        Hivelocity is a privately held company that employs 50 of the best people in the business. Every day we deploy bare-metal servers built to your exact specifications, virtual servers and both public and private cloud hosted solutions. Our data centers maintain compliance for HIPAA, PCI and an SSAE-16 certification. We offer our colocated customers 24/7 private and secure access to their locking cabinets within our facility. Today Hivelocity provides a wide range of bleeding edge solutions and software for thousands of businesses big and small.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
