We are currently developing three product candidates under our INOpulse platform, a proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide device system.  The first is for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) , which is currently in Phase 3 clinical testing.  The other two product candidates are for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD) and pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PH-IPF) which are both in Phase 2 development.
The INOpulse platform is an extension of the technology that is used in hospitals to deliver continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide. Use of inhaled nitric oxide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities across the world to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. An investigational new drug application, or IND, for INOpulse for the treatment of patients with PAH, which is a form of pulmonary hypertension that is closely related to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn was filed in 2010.  A second IND for INOpulse for the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or PH-COPD was filed in 2012. Bellerophon has exclusive worldwide rights to the ongoing INOpulse programs and related intellectual property.

INOpulse for PH-COPD



 Technology for PAH for PH-COPD for PH-IPF


Bellerophon Therapeutics is developing the INOpulse delivery system for the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD).
Mechanism of Action
Nitric oxide (NO) is normally produced in the blood vessel endothelium linings, working on the smooth muscle of the blood vessels to dilate or open the arteries. When nitric oxide enters the smooth muscle cells, it directly activates a chemical called soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in these cells. sGC produces another substance called cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Cyclic GMP then causes the smooth muscle cells to relax, which in turn causes the blood vessels (arteries) to widen or dilate.
COPD patients with advanced disease often have low blood oxygen levels, a condition known as hypoxemia. When parts of the lungs are not well ventilated, as is often the case in COPD, a protective mechanism known as protective hypoxic vasoconstriction can occur. This condition, where the body narrows certain blood vessels in poorly ventilated parts of the lung to send blood to better functioning parts of the lung, is the body’s mechanism to increase the amount of oxygen transferred to the blood. However, when this happens, the narrow arteries can put extra pressure on the heart. In addition, COPD patients often have depressed production of the natural nitric oxide in the blood vessels of their lungs, which also causes them to narrow.
Researchers have suggested that inhaled nitric oxide could help open or dilate the blood vessels in the lungs of these patients. Further, they proposed that dosing as a small pulse early in the patient’s breath could reduce the potential for adverse effects.
Disease Overview
COPD is a chronic progressive disease caused by chronic inflammation and destruction of the airways and lung tissue. While COPD is primarily a respiratory disease, the chronic exposure to toxins in tobacco smoke and resulting lack of oxygen may cause changes in the pulmonary circulation, resulting in chronic pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension, or PH, is a common complication in patients with late-stage COPD. PH-COPD has also shown to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with this condition when compared to similar patients without PH. However, a causal link between higher pulmonary pressures and worsened health outcomes has not yet been proven.
To learn more about this condition, visit the COPD Foundation.
Clinical Need
There is a significant and common unmet medical need for patients with PH associated with COPD that may be overlooked in everyday clinical practice because of the lack of available approved therapy. Also, drugs that are currently used to reduce pulmonary hypertension in PAH patients have been shown to potentially cause other problems, such as worsening hypoxemia, when used on patients with PH-COPD. This may be because these drugs act across a wide portion of the lungs’ blood vessels and can reverse the body’s protective mechanism of hypoxic vasoconstriction.
The INOpulse delivery system was designed to deliver nitric oxide in a targeted fashion allowing it to act primarily on the well-functioning part of the lung. The theory behind this delivery is that because inhaled nitric oxide is very short-acting and is deactivated quickly when it contacts blood, delivering it to well-ventilated parts of the lung will allow it to open up the blood vessels where good gas exchange is possible, while not reversing the body’s protective mechanism in other parts of the lung.
This concept has shown benefit in an open-label randomized control study in a small number of subjects. We are now evaluating this in a larger clinical trial using a new device and dosing regimen and plan to conduct additional studies with the goal of getting this drug-device combination approved, by health regulatory agencies around the world, for use by patients with PH-COPD on long-term oxygen therapy.
Clinical Trials
A Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label, comparative study in 32 subjects with PH associated with COPD was conducted in Austria and sponsored by Messer Austria GmbH. Subjects were randomized to receive either oxygen alone (17 subjects) or oxygen with pulsed inhaled nitric oxide (15 subjects) for 3 months. Pulsed delivery of nitric oxide showed no treatment-limiting long-term effects on lung function, methemoglobin levels, or incidence of adverse events after 3 months of therapy. Importantly, there were reductions in pulmonary arterial pressures and improvements in cardiac output. We have obtained an exclusive license to this data and have incorporated the findings into our clinical development program.
We completed a Phase 2 acute dose ranging trial with the INOpulse DS device in July 2014. Given the nature of the condition, we required that all participants in the trial be on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).
Find out more about this trial at clinicaltrials.gov.
We have initiated a chronic use clinical trial in PH-COPD evaluating the effect on exercise capacity.

INOpulse



 Technology for PAH for PH-COPD for PH-IPF


The active substance in our INOpulse product candidate is pharmaceutical-grade nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a molecule naturally produced in the endothelial lining of blood vessels that plays a significant role in vasodilation, or opening of the arteries, including arteries in the lung. When given to a patient with pulmonary hypertension (PH) who has constricted blood vessels in his or her lungs, it is anticipated that inhaled nitric oxide may be absorbed by the smooth muscles and, through a series of reactions, may help relax these muscles, which causes the blood vessels in the affected area to dilate or open. This is expected to reduce blood pressure in the lungs and therefore reduce the strain on the right ventricle of the patient’s heart and allow blood circulation to become more normal. Since inhaled nitric oxide is quickly inactivated after contact with blood, the product should act locally with minimal potential for systemic effects—an important safety consideration.

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), administered to ventilated patients by a dedicated in-hospital device, is marketed in many countries worldwide. We are now testing whether nitric oxide works in conditions where patients also have some form of pulmonary hypertension, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PH associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD) and PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PH-IPF).
The INOpulse device is designed to be portable for use by ambulatory patients on a daily basis inside or outside their homes. The device is programmed to automatically adjust based on a patient’s breathing pattern to deliver a constant and appropriate dose of the inhaled nitric oxide over time, independent of the patient’s activity level, thus ensuring more consistent dosing in the alveoli of the lungs. In addition, we have developed a proprietary triple-lumen nasal cannula which enables more accurate delivery of the dose to the patient. The INOpulse device is also compatible with many long-term oxygen therapy systems that operate via a nasal cannula. Our newest generation INOpulse device has approximately the same dimensions as a paperback book and weighs approximately 2.5 pounds. It has a simple and intuitive user interface and a battery life of approximately 16 hours when recharged, which takes approximately four hours and can be done while the patient sleeps.

Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. Presents New Clinical Data from Phase 2 Clinical Trial That Investigated INOpulse in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension
May 22 17
Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. announced the presentation of new clinical data from a Phase 2 clinical trial that investigated INOpulse in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH-IPF) at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 113 International Conference, currently taking place in Washington DC. The company also presented preliminary data from a second, ongoing study evaluating INOpulse in COPD patients with Pulmonary Hypertension (PH-COPD). Pulmonary Hypertension with IPF or COPD has no approved therapies and has been associated with increased hospitalizations and mortality. The PH-IPF study was a proof of concept study (n=4) designed to evaluate the ability of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) to provide selective vasodilation as well as assess the potential for improvement in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH-IPF patients. The study met its primary endpoint showing an average of 15.3% increase in blood vessel volume (p<0.001) during acute inhalation of iNO as well as showing a significant association between ventilation and vasodilation, demonstrating the ability of INOpulse to provide selective vasodilation to the better ventilated areas of the lung. The study showed consistent benefit in hemodynamics with a clinically meaningful average reduction of 14% in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) with acute exposure to iNO. The study also assessed the chronic effects of iNO on exercise capacity showing an average 75 meter improvement in 6MWD and consistent improvement of approximately 80 m% in composite endpoints of 6MWD and oxygen saturation with four weeks of treatment. The study assessed both the iNO 75 and iNO 30 dose, supporting iNO 30 as a potentially safe and effective dose.


Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 15 17
Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported loss from operations of $4,783,000 compared to $7,089,000 a year ago. Loss before taxes was $19,143,000 compared to $7,059,000 a year ago. Net loss was $19,143,000 or $0.60 per basic and diluted share compared to $7,059,000 or $0.54 per basic and diluted share a year ago.


Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. Adds $3M as it Enters Phase 3 Trial
May 10 17
Bellerophon Therapeutics Inc. is teeing up a New Drug Application and readying a Phase 3 launch, has lined up $3 million in fresh funding. The registered direct agreement calls for an unidentified investor to purchase 2 million common shares at $1.50 each, and will receive 5.5 year warrants good toward buying 1 million shares at $1.50. There is a six-month lockout period tied to the warrants. H.C. Wainwright & Co. served as placement agent for the deal, which is expected to close by May 17, 2017. The program is on an accelerated pace, which means a second standalone Phase 3 trial will not be required; that will move the timeline up and save the company.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 5,000,000 
shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $52.6 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to 
purchase additional shares, we estimate that the net proceeds from this 
offering will be approximately $61.0 million.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as 
follows:

. approximately $45 million to fund our planned Phase 3 clinical development 
  of INOpulse for PAH; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, 
cash equivalents and restricted cash represents our intentions based upon our 
current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual 
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including 
the progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of 
and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may 
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

As of September 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $30.6 million 
and restricted cash of $13.1 million. Based on our planned use of the net 
proceeds from this offering described above, we estimate that such funds, 
together with our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete our ongoing clinical trial for BCM, to 
fund the first trial in our planned Phase 3 clinical development of INOpulse 
for PAH and to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure 
requirements at least into mid-2016. We have based this estimate on assumptions 
that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources 
sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect that the net proceeds from 
this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will 
be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development and 
commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive.
There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and
private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research
and development of products that may be similar to our products. In addition,
other companies are increasingly looking at cardiac and cardiopulmonary
indications as a potential opportunity. It is possible that the number of
companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet
needs in our target markets will increase.

Our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, may have
substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and
significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product
candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the
commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more
successful than we may be in obtaining approval for therapies and achieving
widespread market acceptance. We anticipate that we will face intense and
increasing competition as new drugs and advanced technologies become available.

Currently, there are 12 drugs approved for the treatment of PAH, within the
following categories: prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs (including Flolan
(epoprostenol), which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, Tyvaso (treprostinil),
Orenitram (treprostinil) and Remodulin (treprostinil), which are marketed by
United Therapeutics Corporation, and Ventavis (iloprost) and Veletri
(epoprostenol), which are marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc., or
Actelion), phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (including Adcirca (tadalafil),
which is marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation, and Revatio (sildenafil),
which is marketed by Pfizer Inc.), endothelin receptor antagonists (including
Letairis (ambrisentan), which is marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Opsumit
(macitentan) and Tracleer (bosentan), which are marketed by Actelion) and a
soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (Adempas (riociguat), which is marketed by
Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Actelion recently submitted an NDA to
the FDA for selexipag, a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist.

There are also other treatments in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical development,
including other nitric oxide generation and delivery systems, including GeNOsyl,
which is being developed by GeNO LLC, and a nebulized formulation of nitrite,
which is being developed by Mast Therapeutics.

Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating PH-COPD, and the
only generally accepted treatments are long-term oxygen therapy, pulmonary
rehabilitation and lung transplant, and we are not aware of any therapies for
PH-COPD in advanced clinical development.

There are no generally accepted products approved for structural support to
prevent cardiac remodeling following an AMI. Other product candidates that are
currently in clinical development include stem cell therapies to restore heart
muscle cells following an AMI, with large Phase 3 trials expected to be
completed in 2018 or 2019. We do not expect BCM to compete with, or replace,
current treatments for congestive heart failure following AMI, but instead
believe it will become part of the treatment regimen used in conjunction with
other therapies. In addition, because BCM can be delivered by a minimally
invasive percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, we do not believe it will
directly compete with devices that are used to treat congestive heart failure,
which are designed for administration during open heart surgery or by
intra-cardiac injection involving a thoracotomy procedure. These include mesh
restraining devices, for example HeartNet; injectable biopolymers, for example
Algisyl-LVR; and implantable electro-stimulation devices, for example,
CardioFit. In addition, volume reduction surgery or cardiac assist devices, or
pumps, are sometimes used to treat patients with congestive heart failure.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing
innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address
significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary and cardiac
diseases. We have two programs in advanced clinical development. The


 first
program, INOpulse, is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery
device. We are currently developing two product candidates under our INOpulse
program: one for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, for
which we intend to commence Phase 3 clinical trials in the second half of 2015,
and the other for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or PH-COPD, which is in Phase 2
development. Our second program is bioabsorbable cardiac matrix, or BCM, which
is currently in a placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to support CE mark
registration in the European Union. We completed enrollment of this trial in
December 2014, with 303 patients having completed the treatment procedure, and
we expect to report top line results in mid-2015. Assuming positive results, we
intend to conduct a pivotal pre-market approval trial of BCM beginning in the
first half of 2016, which will be designed to support registration in the United
States. We are developing BCM for the prevention of cardiac remodeling, which
often leads to congestive heart failure following an ST-segment elevated
myocardial infarction, or STEMI.
