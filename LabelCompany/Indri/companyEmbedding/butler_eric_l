Here are 5 better ideasYahoo FinanceWhat Does It Matter If Trump Repeatedly, Routinely Breaks the Law?HBK2: Hey idiot trumpanzees. Stop deflecting to Obama. Obama has broken zero laws as POTUS. This is a verifiable fact. The GOP would have already impeached him in those 6 years they had control of congress if he did. The biggest criminal and traitor having committed high treason is none other than cheetos jesus himself. You can find him in the white house tweeting at any moment. For some unknown reason the GOP is cowering in fear of this fraud. The trumpanzees just want someone to worship, even if it is an orange pile of #$%$. They want to express their anger at all other Americans for having elected Obama president, and their unjustified hate for Clinton. And if the Constituion, "Declaration of Independence", Comey, Colbert, or any other document, investigator, journalist, messengers, comedian, etc. happen to get in their way, they go into a fit of rage against them. They do NOT care if cheetos jesus sell off American to Russian, or if "R" in republican is now the same as "Russians". They just want to see the world burn because they are angry and #$%$ off at everything, and for others not respecting their special white snow flake status.Join the Conversation1 / 5569

Jonathan Butler, a central figure in the protests at the University of Missouri, is an Omaha native and the son of a railroad vice president, the Omaha World-Herald reports.Butler refused food last week in a move to force the university system's president, Timothy M. Wolfe, from office. Wolfe resigned Monday and Butler ended his hunger strike.
Jonathan Butler played high-school football at Omaha Central High, where he won a state championship, and earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Mizzou, the newspaper reports. He is working toward a master’s degree in educational leadership and policy.
He is a member of a prominent Omaha family. The newspaper says that Butler's father is Eric L. Butler, executive vice president for sales and marketing for the Union Pacific Railroad. His 2014 compensation was $8.4 million, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Eric L. Butler and his wife, Cynthia Butler, serve as pastors of Joy of Life Ministries, the newspaper reported. Along with Jonathan Butler, the couple has two other children.Butler, who was seen walking on the Mizzou campus on Tuesday, has declined to be interviewed by the Post-Dispatch, other than to say he was feeling better.

Eric L. Butler, Ph.D.
Principal





Dr. Butler is an environmental chemistry expert with over 20 years experience evaluating the source and fate of chemicals in the environment.  He has applied chemical fingerprinting techniques, including isotopic methods, in projects involving petroleum hydrocarbons, PAHs, PCBs, dioxins/furans, and solvents.  He specializes in and has testified on oil chemistry, including PCB oils, the composition of petroleum products, source identification, and the fate of chemicals in the environment.  At Gradient, he focuses on designing analytical chemistry programs and litigation support involving forensic chemistry.  Dr. Butler has performed and directed numerous chemical analyses using both laboratory and field chemistry techniques.  In addition, he has developed an expertise in contemporary archeology ("garbology") to date environmental disposal activities by dating the co-disposed artifacts, and has testified in court on the topic.  Before coming to Gradient, he served the US Congress as a Congressional Science Fellow, directed a municipal laboratory specializing in VOC and bacteriological analyses, and directed numerous environmental studies relating to the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

Representative Projects
PCBs in Soils and Sediments:  Expert report and testimony on the nature and source of PCBs at a former metal recycling facility.  Supported cost allocation analysis for PCBs in river sediments and flood plain, and oversaw data quality assurance of the investigation and remediation of a transformer manufacturing facility.
Dioxin Fingerprinting:  Directed and interpreted dioxin fingerprinting analyses.  Evaluated the source of dioxins in plaintiffs' blood by comparing dioxin fingerprints of local soil, local emissions, national emissions, and food.
Petroleum Hydrocarbons:  Major researcher and author of studies of the water and sediment quality of the Prince William Sound following the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  The studies encompassed over 3,000 water samples and over 1,000 sediment samples.
Petroleum Hydrocarbon Fingerprinting:  Expert reports and testimony for many clients.  Used advanced GC/FID and GC/MS hydrocarbon fingerprinting to identify sources of fugitive petroleum products, PAHs, and MGP tars in soils, sediments, as well as groundwater.
Petroleum Hydrocarbons/Indoor Air:  Expert report and testimony regarding the sources of indoor air contaminants in a neighborhood underlain by NAPL.
Forensic Chemistry:  Identified the sources of chlorinated solvent plumes by compound specific isotope analysis of PCE and TCE in soils and groundwater.
PAH Source Identification:  Trial testimony regarding the sources of constituents of interest to a wood-treating site.  Designed and implemented an analytical program that demonstrated the presence of non-creosote sources of various PAHs at the site.
Contemporary Archeology:  Expert reports and trial testimony on the use of contemporary archeology to date environmental activities (disposal, tank closures, etc.) at transportation and manufacturing facilities.
