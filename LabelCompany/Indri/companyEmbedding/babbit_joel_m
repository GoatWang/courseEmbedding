The majority of Babbit's career has been spent in the advertising agency business, working with clients including AT&T, The Coca-Cola Company, Dell, Home Depot, RJR Nabisco and United Parcel Service.[2][4][8][9]
Babbit began working at McCann Erickson in 1978,[10] and would later serve as executive vice president of Chiat/Day and president of WPP's GCI Group.[8][11] He co-founded Babbit & Reiman Advertising with business partner Joey Reiman,[2] and served as CEO while it became one of the largest advertising agencies in the U.S. Southeast.[8][10] In 1988, it was acquired by London-based Gold Greenlees Trott.[8] Babbit also co-founded 360,[9] a marketing firm later acquired by WPP's Grey Global Group.[12][13]

Through MNN, Babbit and Leavell also created and produce the White House Correspondents' Jam, held annually in Washington, D.C.[26][27]
Civic involvement[edit]
Following Atlanta’s selection to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, Babbit took a leave of absence from the private sector and was appointed by Mayor Maynard Jackson to be the city’s first chief marketing and communications officer.[16][28] He also served as a member of the mayor's cabinet.[29]
Babbit has done pro bono work for organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, United Way of America, Boys & Girls Club and the United Nations Foundation.[1][30] He wrote and produced a 2015 public service video about road rage starring former professional boxer Evander Holyfield,[31] which has been viewed more than 12 million times on YouTube (as of September 2016).[32]
Babbit has been active in numerous civic and non-profit organizations, including the Young Presidents' Organization, the CDC Foundation, the Atlanta History Center and the Anti-Defamation League. He is currently a director of Primerica and GreenSky Credit.[1][30][33]

                Joel Babbit: He has been named president of New York-based GCI, one of the world's… more 








 



Joel Babbit is about to cross a line that few on Madison Avenue have crossed.
The chief creative officer of Atlanta ad agency Grey Worldwide -- with clients from BellSouth Corp. to Georgia-Pacific -- will become the president of New York-based GCI, one of the world's largest public relations firms.

                            Joel Babbit: He has been named president of New York-based GCI, one of the world's… more 










 


Grey and GCI are sister companies that share office space in Midtown Atlanta and share a parent company, the publicly traded, London-based holding company WPP Group Plc. New York-based Grey Global Group is the sixth-largest communications company in the world, including GCI, its PR division.
Babbit says although he's one of the first ad men to simultaneously become the head of a PR agency (while maintaining his hold on the Atlanta ad company) -- he won't be the last.
"I know this is the direction things are heading in," said Babbit. "I see it every day with our clients. They're saying, 'Look. I need some great ideas. I need some new ways of thinking.' The client doesn't care anymore where an idea comes from, as long as it's good."
Babbit, 52, now president and chief creative officer for GCI, is known for his eccentric marketing ideas. He was hired by Mayor Maynard Jackson to sell the ATL, and once proposed beaming ads to earthlings from outer space during the 1996 Olympics.
More recently, his ad agency was the creative force behind Brand Atlanta, responsible for the city slogan, "every day is an opening day." The campaign received a lukewarm welcome by some, but is being used by many of the city's boosters and attractions.
The ad man is also known as a principal of the electric ad agency Babbit & Reiman, which had its heyday in the go-go 1980s, giving Atlanta a place, albeit fleeting, in advertising lore. (That agency was bought by London-based GGT in 1991.)





Babbit later founded ad agency 360 with partner Mark Goldman. After jointly pitching and winning BellSouth's ad account with Grey Global, Grey acquired 360 in 2002. BellSouth is still the Atlanta office's largest account, said Babbit.

But he's never led a company the size of GCI, which has 600 employees, and admits it will be an experiment.
Babbit cited recent articles in PR Week, an industry journal, debating the blurring of the lines between public relations and advertising. Many believe this is the future.
"Public relations usually intersects in the CEO's office, especially when they've got a big opportunity or a big problem," said Tom Bell, president and CEO of Cousins Properties Inc. in Atlanta, and a client of Grey Atlanta. Bell himself is a former ad man, retiring as chairman and CEO of Young & Rubicam Inc. (NYSE: YNR) when it merged with WPP (Nasdaq: WPPGY) in 2000.
"I think that less emphasis is put on pure advertising, or paid media, and more emphasis is put on overall brand building and strategy," said Bell. "Probably [Babbit] can do that just as well or better from the chair he's going to be in than the one he has been in."
More and more over the past 10 years, as traditional media have given way to ad spaces on the Internet, cell phones, e-mail and niche cable channels, advertisers have been following a more integrated approach, said Birgit Wassmuth, the chair of the communications department at Kennesaw State University.
Public relations, Internet advertising, product placement and guerrilla, or street, marketing now fill the spaces so-called "traditional" advertising used to occupy.
"Historically, it's been unusual to cross lines like that," said Jeff Johnson, general manager of New York ad agency Cramer-Krasselt and the former head of Atlanta ad shop WestWayne. "Historically, what have been disparate disciplines are really merging together," he said of PR and advertising. "It makes sense in theory that these lines merge," as clients want more and more flexibility with getting out their messages.
Still, Jack O'Dwyer, who writes an influential PR newsletter based in Manhattan with about 29,000 unique hits online each month, wasn't in favor of the move.




 


"PR and advertising are very different types of communication. Advertising's job is to convince the consumer, while PR's job is to convince the press, a much more demanding audience. ... A major function of PR is debating the pros and cons of something. Ads don't engage in debates."
But Kennesaw's Wassmuth sees that as an old rivalry.
During the last decade, the buzzword has been "integrated" marketing campaigns, of which public relations is an element, she said.
She sees crossovers and linkages in the now-blanket term of "marketing," from product placement to scripts of movies like "Castaway," in which FedEx Corp. plays a major role.
The goal, she said, is to reach a target audience in many areas, ideally in an unexpected situation or under the radar.
It's all a battle for the hearts, minds and dollars of consumers, and Babbit will be running a two-flank assault to gain more market share for his clients.
"It's pushing the envelope, but I think that's what is required," said Jeff Hunt, the GCI CEO who is handing over his title of president to Babbit. Hunt will be in charge of operations, as Babbit leads GCI's creative and strategic thinking.
"The status quo won't succeed in this new world order. I'm glad people view this as an unusual, out-of-the-box move," said Hunt. "That's reassuring to me."
GCI Group, headquartered in New York, has 50 offices worldwide, and Babbit's goal is to visit each one in the next few years, from Bangkok to Budapest. GCI's global clients include Dell, Genentech, InterContinental Hotels Group Plc, Merck, Microsoft Corp., Nike and Starbucks.
Babbit will be based in Atlanta, much like CEO Hunt is based in Houston.
"I see him almost like a gravitational force to help us shift our orientation to the marketplace. He's wildly creative," said Hunt. "He's always right for the times, and very relevant for the marketplace."
Babbit admitted to being a bit nervous with a job of this magnitude. And he knows he'll be under the microscope, leading the experiment in blurring the lines.
Said Babbit: "I'll only mind that if it doesn't work out."
