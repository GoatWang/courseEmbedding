New product offering provides states flexible technology that can be customized for any exchange configuration






Atlanta, GA (PRWEB)
September 8, 2010
 Connecture, Inc., the leading provider of web-based sales, service, and process automation solutions for health insurance distribution, announced today a new product offering for state health exchanges called StateAdvantage.  
With the passage of health reform, Connecture continues to focus on providing innovative technology that brings carriers, brokers, navigators, call centers, and consumers together.  The overall objective is to provide states with the right technology options to help their residents purchase affordable health insurance while creating sustainable and recurring value for the state. 
“StateAdvantage was developed to be flexible enough to be customized for any state exchange configuration and robust enough to simplify the complexities within state programs,” commented Bob Barry, Senior Vice President for Product and Market Strategy at Connecture.  “The system provides an intuitive, easy, web-based shopping experience, utilizing powerful user education and support tools such as automated plan finders and online chat capabilities. Even though the exchange may seem complex, time-consuming and costly, states can be successful and provide a meaningful service to their constituents.  StateAdvantage can help accelerate state exchange goals.”
Connecture’s Barry notes that there are four key drivers for a successful state exchange.  The exchange must be:
1. Comprehensive - utilizing technology that spans market segments and encompasses new business, policy maintenance and renewal functionality;
2 .Effective - providing an exceptional buying experience through a website that makes it easy to acquire coverage;
3. Sustainable - implementing maintenance tools and integrations to reduce the costs to maintain an Exchange; and
4. Adaptable - easily adapting to health reform changes and market forces driven over time
StateAdvantage keeps these success factors in mind and offers states a proven, innovative technology platform that is flexible and adaptable.
