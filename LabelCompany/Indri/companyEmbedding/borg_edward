Edward Borg
Co Founder at Thought3D







Edward Borg is co-founder and Chief Technical Officer of Thought3D Ltd where he is responsible for automation and production and leads technical development.
After studying Software Engineering at the University of Malta, Edward went to work in Germany. During this time he was awarded a prize by Intel for his software contributions. He also further studied Engineering with The Open University with a particular interest in Nano Technology developing a low cost, mostly 3D printed, Atomic Force Microscope. Additionally he took classes at Udacity on Artificial Intelligence and Android Programming.
Together with Dr. Keith M. Azzopardi, Edward felt the need of developing something useful. The first product idea was related to a common passion they have, that for scuba diving. Subsequently, they ended up founding Thought3D Ltd. and creating Magigoo. Thought3D focuses on solving major issues in Additive Manufacturing, assuring this technology disrupts the future. Thought3D has won the Malta Innovation Awards, won the TakeOff Seed Fund Award and the GoGlobal Award, was nominated Best Emerging Company at TCT Show, was Runner up as Best Tech Startup and was also recipient of a number of grants.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

About Us

Edward Borg Bartolo
E.J.V Borg Bros. was founded in 1952, between Edward (1926-2008), Joseph & Victor, brothers BORG, with the principle scope of promoting the advancement in all fields of agriculture, but with particular reference to animal husbandry and meat production, through the application of the latest scientific techniques being advanced by the best Agricultural Colleges abroad.
The hard pioneering work Edward put into the business was to be give the company, a head start in a yet uncharted sector of the Maltese economy, which advantage the Company maintained for a good number of years. Through his efforts and enterprising spirit he considerably facilitated the farmers’ everyday workload. As a competent man of vision, determination and high integrity, he earned great respect.
Vertical Axis Wind Turbine @ UoM – project realized in July 2011
At the age of thirteen, Ramon, jointed his father Edward, where he eagerly took to the ropes. This proved to be a long and through apprenticeship. In the early 70s, prompted by the favourable climate for industrial expansion, the company secured its major contact when it supplied the fuel purification equipment required for the first vessels under construction at the Malta Shipyards; with similar contracts coming its way on a regular basis from then on. In due course, Ramon was taken on as partner with the role of Projects’ Manager, whilst Edward covered the logistic and administrative side of the business. As the company gained ever increasing engineering skill and expertise it installed and commissioned competently, with diligence and professional expertise, a considerable number of Industrial Weighing Systems, Centrifugal Purifiers, Heat Exchangers for various applications, High efficiency Electric Motors and a wide variety of specialized machinery.
Over the past year, despite the current economic recession, with courage and undaunted enterprising spirit, the company made some significant headway in consolidating its position, whilst managing to chalk some firsts as well; with exports going to Libya, successfully commissioning a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine at the University, and on being awarded [with others] a theatre refurbishment project.
Quality and Reliability are the hallmarks of E.J.V BORG BROS.
