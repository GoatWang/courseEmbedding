What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits.

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft.

A Promissory Note is a written contract between Lender and Borrower that sets forth the terms and conditions upon which money is being borrowed and will be paid back.  Promissory Notes are also commonly used in sales transactions where the Buyer does not pay the balance in full at the time of the purchase.  If a Borrower defaults on the terms of a Promissory Note, the Lender can take legal action. TotalLegal makes it easy to create a Promissory Note customized to meet your needs.

Specify whom you would like to receive your property
State your funeral and burial instructions
Create a trust for minor children
Disinherit a person(s)
Name a guardian for minor children

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

At either 48 or 60 months on your Special Prepayment Date, you can:

Sell your vehicle to Ally at a predetermined price (minus excess mileage and wear)
Keep the vehicle and continue making payments until the end of the contract term

See an example timeline.
Ally Buyer’s Choice is available in every state except Nevada.

You can trade in your vehicle at any time during your agreement  – the choice is yours.

What to Know About FinancingA little knowledge goes a long way
We know auto financing is complicated. Just remember that it’s ok to learn as you go. Here are a few tips to get you started on the right track.







Shop Around
The only way to ensure you’re getting the best possible rate on your financing is to do your homework. While you can usually get financing through the dealership, you should also get quotes from local banks, online banks and credit unions. And don’t forget to ask about rebates and incentives. Your credit score can also have a significant impact on your rate, but the rate you’re quoted will also depend on the lender. Learn how your credit score can impact your rate.





Buy or Lease?
While buying tends to be most people’s default option, a lease can be the perfect solution for someone who prefers to drive a new car every 2 or 3 years and wants to keep monthly payments reasonable. There are advantages and drawbacks to both buying and leasing, so make sure you research both options to find the best fit for your situation. Compare your options.







Talk It Out
Once you have an idea of which lenders can offer the best rate, you can often negotiate that rate even lower. Since auto dealerships often have more flexibility than other lenders, your dealership may be willing to match or beat quoted rates from other lenders. Make sense of the financing process.





Get the Big Picture
Getting a low rate is great, but remember that it’s only part of the picture. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the total amount you’ll be paying over the life of the financing plan when factoring in the length of the contract, cost of insurance and potential fees. Our monthly payment calculator can help give you a better idea of what you’ll be paying every month.

How does the Special Prepayment feature work?

What if the market value of the vehicle is higher than the predetermined selling price?

Was  this  helpful?

No








Can I change my mind after the Special Prepayment Date and still sell the vehicle to Ally?

as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the
other Basic Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or in any other document, neither the Trust nor the
Owner Trustee (nor any agent of either person) shall be authorized

may be. Any such trustee shall take such part of the Owner Trust
Estate subject to the security interest of the Indenture Trustee

lien and security interest of the Indenture Trustee.

States of Delaware or New York. All bank accounts maintained by the
Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall be located in the State
of Delaware or the State of New York. The Trust shall not have any

The Depositor and Owner Trustee, by entering into this Agreement,
express their intention that the Trust will be treated, for United
States federal income tax purposes, as a grantor trust and it is

for United States federal income tax purposes, qualify as interests
in a grantor trust and (ii) unless otherwise required by the
appropriate taxing authorities, agree to treat the Certificates as
interests in an entity as described in clause (i) of this
Section 2.11 for United States federal income tax purposes.
The parties agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate
tax authorities, the Trust shall file or cause to be filed annual
or other necessary returns, reports and other forms consistent with
such characterization of the Trust for such tax purposes. In
furtherance of the foregoing, (i) the purpose of the Trust shall be

any kind of commercial or investment activity other than as
expressly permitted by this Trust Agreement and (ii) the Trust and
Owner Trustee (and any agent of either person) shall take, or
refrain from taking, all such action as is necessary to maintain
the status of the Trust as a grantor

in this Trust Agreement or otherwise, neither the Trust nor the
Owner Trustee (nor any agent of either person) shall
(1) acquire any assets or dispose of any portion of the Trust
other than pursuant to the specific provisions of this Trust
Agreement, (2) vary the investment of the Trust within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c) or
(3) substitute new investments or reinvest so as to enable the
Trust to take advantage of variations in the market to improve the
investment of any Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee shall not
have any authority to manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or
otherwise deal with any part of the Trust property except as
required by the express terms of this Trust Agreement in accordance
with the powers granted to or the authority conferred upon the

THE CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 Initial
Certificate Ownership . Since the formation of the Trust by the

the Depositor has been the sole beneficial owner of the
Trust.

At the election of the Certificateholder of the Retained

Section 3.2(a) may be exchanged for Book-Entry
Certificates.

(b) Each of the Certificates, other
than Retained Certificates, upon original issuance, shall be issued
in the form of Exhibit A hereto, representing

the aggregate nominal principal amount of all Certificates to
exceed $100,000, or 100,000 units, without the prior written
consent of all Certificateholders. No distributions of moneys to
the Certificateholders under the Basic Documents shall be deemed to

however , that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to
the Certificateholders under the Basic Documents upon final
distribution of the Trust Estate and termination of the Trust
pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be deemed to repay the
aggregate nominal principal amount of the Certificates in full; and
provided , further , that any failure to pay
in full the nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final
distribution date shall not result in any recourse to, claim
against or liability of any Person for such shortfall. Any amounts
payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Basic Documents shall be paid and allocated
to the various Certificateholders ratably based on their respective
Percentage Interests. Such Book-Entry Certificates shall initially
be registered on the Certificate Register in the name of the
Certificate Depository (initially, Cede & Co.), and no
Certificate Owner shall receive a Definitive Certificate
representing such Certificate Owner’s interest in such
Book-Entry Certificate, except as provided in
Section 3.12 . Unless and until the Book-Entry
Certificates are exchanged for Definitive Certificates by the
applicable Certificateholders pursuant to Section 3.12

(ii) the Certificate Registrar, the
Paying Agent and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to deal with
the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Agreement (including

Documents with regard to the Book-Entry Certificates to such
Clearing Agency Participants;

directions of Certificateholders evidencing a specified Percentage
Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver instructions to the
Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has received instructions
to such effect from Certificate Owners or Clearing Agency
Participants or Persons acting through Clearing Agency Participants
owning or representing, respectively, such required percentage of
the beneficial interest in the Book-Entry Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial interest
in a Book-Entry Certificate shall not be entitled to have any
portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their names and
shall not be considered to be the Certificateholders of any
Book-Entry Certificates under this Trust Agreement; and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry
Certificate shall be made to the Clearing Agency, or its nominee,
as the registered owner thereof, and none of the Trust, the Owner
Trustee or the Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Book-Entry
Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to the beneficial ownership interests.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Certificate remains
outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Clearing Agency,
transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or in part, shall
only be made in accordance with Section 3.4 . Subject
to Section 3.4 , transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be limited to transfers of such Book-Entry Certificate in

successor of the Clearing Agency or such successor’s
nominee.

exchanged for one another only in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time
adopted by the Trust and the Owner Trustee.

Trust delivered upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by
its chairman of the board, its president or any vice president,
without further limited liability company action by the Depositor.
Such Retained Certificate shall be issued to and held by the
Depositor. No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit
under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless
there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit
A , executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee’s
authenticating agent, by manual signature. Such authentication
shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall
have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All

required if, prior to the date of the effectiveness of such sale,

as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes. In
addition, (i) such sale, pledge or other transfer shall be
made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a

that such transfer will not
 
8


violate the Securities Act.

Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of a like
aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust, as shown on the

assets include less than 25% plan assets and for which the purchase
and holding of Certificates is eligible and satisfies all
conditions for relief under Prohibited Transaction

acquired by or for the account of an employee benefit plan or plan
that is not subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (including non-U.S. or governmental
plans) if such acquisition would result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under, or a violation of, any applicable law that is
substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code.

accompanied with a Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E, as applicable) under this Section 3.4(i) in
order to claim the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest
under Section 881(c) of the Code (instead of, for example,

the “ FATCA Administrator ”) at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the FATCA Administrator such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section

FATCA and to determine that such Certificateholder or beneficial
owner of a Certificate has complied with such person’s
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and
withhold from such payment to such person.

will offer, transfer, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of the

any manner, or solicit any offer to buy, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Certificates or any interest in the Certificates
from any Person in any manner, or make any general solicitation by
means of general advertising or in any other manner, or take any
other action that would constitute a distribution of the
Certificates under the Securities Act or that would render the
disposition of the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of
the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws or
require registration pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any
Person to act on its behalf, in such manner with respect to the
Certificates.

(o) In connection with the transfer
of a Certificate, the Trust shall determine in its sole discretion
that the transfer complies with the requirements of Section
3.4(i) through 3.4(k) of this Agreement.

Section 3.7 Access to List
of Certificateholders’ Names and Addresses . The
Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Servicer and the Depositor, within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request therefor from the
Servicer or the Depositor in writing, a list of the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record
Date. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, shall be
deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Servicer, the
Depositor, the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee
accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address,
regardless of the source from which such information was
derived.

Section 3.8 Maintenance of
Corporate Trust Office . The Owner Trustee shall maintain an
office or offices or agency or agencies where Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Certificates and the Basic Documents may be served. The Owner
Trustee initially designates its office located at 301 Bellevue
Parkway, 3rd Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19809, as its principal
office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice to the Depositor, to the Servicer and to the
Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate
Register or any such office or agency.

Section 3.9 Appointment of
Paying Agent . Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Paying Agent shall make distributions
to Certificateholders from the Certificate Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall report the amounts of
such distributions to the Owner Trustee and the Servicer;
provided , however , that no such reports shall be
required so long as the Depositor is the sole Certificateholder.
Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds
from the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making
the distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke
such power and remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be The Bank of
New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, and any
co-paying agent chosen by BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware. The Bank of
New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association shall be
permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon thirty
(30) days’ written notice to the Owner Trustee. If The
Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association shall
no longer be the Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a
successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust
company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor Paying Agent
or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee to
execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which
such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying
Agent or additional Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held
by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums
shall be paid to such Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall
return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of
a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of Sections
6.3 , 6.6 , 6.7 and 6.9 shall apply to the
Owner Trustee also in
 
14


its role as Paying Agent or Certificate
Registrar for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Paying
Agent or Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to
any other paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating
agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context
requires otherwise.

Section 3.10 Depositor as
Certificateholder . The Depositor in its individual or any
other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates and
may otherwise deal with the Owner Trustee or its Affiliates as if
it were not the Depositor.

Section 3.11 Rule 144A
Information . The Depositor shall, during any period in which a
purchaser of the Certificates holds such Certificate and in which
the Depositor is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, make available, upon request, to any holder of such
Certificates in connection with any sale thereof and any
prospective purchaser of Certificates from such holder, the
information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act.

Section 3.12 Definitive
Certificates . If (i) the Administrator advises the Owner
Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or
able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the
Book-Entry Certificates and the Trust is unable to locate a
qualified successor; (ii) the Administrator, at its option,
advises the Owner Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate
the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency; or
(iii) Certificate Owners representing beneficial interests
aggregating at least a majority of the Percentage Interests in the
Trust advise the Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation
of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in
the best interests of the Certificate Owners, then the Clearing
Agency shall notify all Certificate Owners and the Owner Trustee of
the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
Definitive Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same.
Upon surrender to the Owner Trustee of the typewritten Certificate
or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificate by the
Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the
Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee shall authenticate the
Definitive Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the
Clearing Agency. None of the Trust, the Certificate Registrar or
the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected
in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the
Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders.

Section 3.13 Notices to
Clearing Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication to
the Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to the owner
of a Certificate pursuant to Section 3.12 , the Owner
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to the Certificateholders to the Clearing
Agency, and shall have no obligation to the beneficial owner of a
Certificate.

Section 3.14 Restrictions on
Note Acquisitions . Neither a member of any “expanded
group” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.385-1(c)(4)) that includes the Trust or a Certificate Owner nor a
“controlled partnership” (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.385-1(c)(1)) of such expanded group shall
acquire any Notes from the Trust, any Affiliate, or through the
marketplace prior to obtaining an Opinion of Counsel stating that
(i) the acquisition
 
15


or reacquisition of such Note will not cause the
Trust, initially upon such acquisition or subsequent to the
acquisition, to be classified as an association or publicly traded
partnership treated as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes and will not cause the Note to be recharacterized as stock
pursuant to Treasury Regulations under section 385 of the Code or
otherwise cause the Trust not to be classified as a grantor trust.
The preceding sentence shall not apply to (i) any U.S.
corporate member of the same U.S. corporate affiliated group (as
defined in Section 1504 of the Code) filing a consolidated
federal income tax return that includes the Trust or every
applicable Certificate Owner (the “ Trust Consolidated
Group ”) or (ii) a partnership all of the partners
of which are either such U.S. corporate members of the Trust
Consolidated Group as described in clause (A) or partnerships
all of the partners of which are such U.S. corporate members of the
Trust Consolidated Group as described in clause (A). No member of
any “expanded group” that includes the Trust or
Certificate Owner (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.385-1(b)(3)) or “controlled partnership” of such
expanded group (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.385-1(c)(4)) shall transfer any Notes outside the expanded group
prior to obtaining an Opinion of Counsel stating that the transfer
of such Note will not cause the Trust to be classified as an
association or publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation
for federal income tax purposes and will not cause the Note to be
recharacterized as stock pursuant to Treasury Regulations under
section 385 of the Code or otherwise cause the Trust not to be
classified as a grantor trust.

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS;
CERTAIN DUTIES

Section 5.1 Establishment of
Certificate Distribution Account .

(a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Servicer, for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Trust an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Ally Auto
Receivables Trust 2017-1 Certificate Distribution Account (the
“ Certificate Distribution Account ”), bearing
an additional designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. The Certificate Distribution Account shall
initially be established as a segregated trust account with The
Bank of New York Mellon.

(b) The Certificateholders shall
possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account
and in all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein,
in the Indenture or in the Servicing Agreement, the Certificate
Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution
Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Owner Trustee
(or the Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate
Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner Trustee or an
Affiliate thereof) shall within ten (10) Business Days (or
such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
as to which each Rating Agency may consent) establish a new
Certificate Distribution Account as an Eligible Deposit Account and
shall transfer any cash or any investments to such new Certificate
Distribution Account.

Section 5.2 Application of
Trust Funds .

(a) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent shall distribute to the
Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis, amounts equal to the
amounts deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant
to Section 4.06 and Section 4.07 of the Servicing
Agreement on or prior to such Distribution Date. Funds received by
the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Eastern
time) on any Distribution Date will be distributed to the
Certificateholders on such Distribution Date. Each of the Owner
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall use its best efforts to
distribute any funds received after 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on any
Distribution Date to the Certificateholders as soon as reasonably
possible, but neither the Owner Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall
be liable if such funds are not distributed until the next Business
Day. Any funds received by the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent
after 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) shall be held uninvested in the
Certificate Distribution Account until distributed to the
Certificateholders, and neither the Owner Trustee nor the Paying
Agent shall be liable for any interest thereon.
 
18



(b) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee shall send to each Certificateholder the statement
provided to the Owner Trustee by the Servicer pursuant to
Section 4.09 of the Servicing Agreement on such Distribution
Date; provided that no such statement shall be required to
be sent by the Owner Trustee if and for so long as the Depositor is
the sole Certificateholder.

(c) If any withholding tax is
imposed on the Trust’s payment (or allocations of income) to
a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this
Section 5.2 ; provided that the Owner Trustee or
the Paying Agent shall not have an obligation to withhold any such
amount if and for so long as the Depositor is the sole
Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the
payment of any tax that is legally payable by the Trust (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or the Paying
Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and
withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the
outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax
imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as
cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is
withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a
non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent
may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this Section 5.2(c) . If a Certificateholder wishes to apply
for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee or the
Paying Agent shall reasonably cooperate with such Certificateholder
in making such claim so long as such Certificateholder agrees to
reimburse the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

(d) If the Indenture Trustee holds
escheated funds for payment to the Trust pursuant to Section
3.3(e) of the Indenture, the Owner Trustee shall, upon notice
from the Indenture Trustee that such funds exist, submit on behalf
of the Trust an Issuing Entity Order to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture instructing the
Indenture Trustee to pay such funds to or at the order of the
Depositor.

Section 5.3 Method of
Payment . Subject to Section 7.1(c) , distributions
required to be made to Certificateholders on any Distribution Date
shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the related
Record Date by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to
the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity having
appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall
have provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written
instructions at least five (5) Business Days prior to such
Distribution Date or if not, by check mailed to such
Certificateholder at the address of such Certificateholder
appearing in the Certificate Register; provided ,
however , that, unless and until Definitive Certificates
have been issued pursuant to Section 3.12 , with
respect to Book-Entry Certificates registered on the applicable
Record Date in the name of the Certificate Depository (initially,
Cede & Co.), payment shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Certificate Depository.
 
19



Section 5.4 Accounting and
Reports to the Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and
Others . The Owner Trustee shall maintain (or cause to be
maintained) the books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the
accrual method of accounting, deliver to each Certificateholder, as
may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations or
otherwise, such information as may be required to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax return, file
such tax returns relating to the Trust and make such elections as
may from time to time be required or appropriate under any
applicable State or federal statute or rule or regulation
thereunder so as to maintain the Trust’s characterization as
an entity described in Section 2.11 for federal income
tax purposes, cause such tax returns to be signed in the manner
required by law and collect or cause to be collected any
withholding tax as described in and in accordance with Section
5.2(c) with respect to income or distributions to
Certificateholders. The Owner Trustee (or, if the Depositor is the
sole Certificateholder, the Administrator) shall annually cause to
be sent to each Certificateholder a separate statement setting
forth each such Certificateholder’s share of items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit and will instruct each such
Certificateholder to report such items on its federal income tax
return. The Owner Trustee (or, if the Depositor is the sole
Certificateholder, the Administrator) shall prepare or cause to be
prepared the returns and information required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.671-5, as well as any other applicable
provisions of law, to be provided and filed, as applicable, in the
manner prescribed therein.

Section 5.5 Signature on
Returns; Other Tax Matters . The Owner Trustee shall sign on
behalf of the Trust any and all tax returns of the Trust, unless
applicable law requires a Certificateholder to sign such documents,
in which case such Certificateholder hereby agrees to sign such
document and to cooperate fully with the reasonable requests of the
Owner Trustee with respect thereto.

(c) The foregoing sales, transfers,

Person in connection with the Receivables, any Dealer Agreements,
any insurance policies or any other agreement or instrument

Section 2.03 Representations and
Warranties as to the Receivables . Pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(v) , the Depositor assigns to the
Issuing Entity all of its right, title and interest in, to and
under the Pooling Agreement. Such assigned right, title and
interest includes the benefit of the representations and warranties
of the Seller made to the Depositor pursuant to Section 3.01
of the Pooling Agreement. The Depositor hereby represents and
warrants to the Issuing Entity that the Depositor has taken no
action which would cause such representations and warranties of the
Seller to be false in any material respect as of the Closing Date.
The Depositor further acknowledges that the Issuing Entity and its
permitted assignees rely on the representations and warranties of
the Depositor under this Agreement and of the Seller under the
Pooling Agreement in accepting the Receivables and executing and
delivering the Notes and the Certificates. The foregoing
representation and warranty speaks as of the Closing Date, but
shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables
to the Issuing Entity and the pledge thereof to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

Section 2.04 Repurchase of
Receivables Upon Breach of Warranty . Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Depositor, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.01 of the Pooling Agreement or in
Section 2.03 or Section 3.01 of this
Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of
the Noteholders or the Certificateholders in any Receivable, the
party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the others. As of the last day of the second Monthly
Period following its discovery or its receipt of notice of such
breach (or, at the Depositor’s election, the last day of the
first Monthly Period following such discovery or receipt of
notice), unless such breach shall have been cured in all material
respects, in the event of a breach of the representations and
warranties made by the Depositor in Section 2.03 or
Section 3.01 , the Depositor shall repurchase, or in
the event of a breach of a representation and warranty under
Section 3.01 of the Pooling Agreement, the Depositor shall use
reasonable efforts to enforce the obligation of the Seller under
Section 4.04 of the Pooling Agreement to repurchase such
Receivable from the Issuing Entity on the related Distribution
Date. The repurchase price to be paid by the breaching party (the
“ Warranty Purchaser ”) shall be an amount equal
to the Warranty Payment calculated as of the last day of the
related Monthly Period. It is understood and agreed that the
obligation of the Warranty Purchaser to repurchase any Receivable
as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing, and the
obligation of the Depositor to enforce the Seller’s
obligation to repurchase such Receivables pursuant to the Pooling
Agreement shall, if such obligations are fulfilled, constitute the
sole remedy against the Depositor or the Seller for such breach
available to the Issuing Entity, the Financial Parties, the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

ARTICLE III

Section 3.01 Representations of
the Depositor . The Depositor makes the following

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits.

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
