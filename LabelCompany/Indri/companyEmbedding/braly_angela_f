WellPoint’s Executive Team



Angela Braly


Leaders in Health Care


An Interview with Angela F. Braly, Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer, WellPoint, Inc. and Lori Beer, Dr. Harlan Levine, and Randy Brown


Editors’ NoteIn June 2007, Angela Braly was named President and Chief Executive Officer and she assumed the role of Chair of the Board in March 2010. Prior to becoming CEO, Braly served as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Public Affairs Officer for WellPoint. Braly was previously President and CEO of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Missouri. She joined Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in January 1999 as General Counsel after serving for several years as a lawyer in private practice. Braly serves on the Board of Directors of Procter & Gamble, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and the National Institute for Health Care Management. She received her Juris Doctor from Southern Methodist University School of Law and her undergraduate degree from Texas Tech University.
Company BriefWellPoint, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest health benefits companies, with approximately 34 million Americans nationwide covered through its affiliated health plans. The company offers leading health benefits plans as well as specialty products and services designed to provide quality and value to its customers. WellPoint primarily does business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, or Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. WellPoint (www.wellpoint.com) also serves customers throughout the country as UniCare.
How have you remained strong and grown in these challenging times?
Our consumer brand, which is how most people know us, is Blue Cross Blue Shield, and the Blue Cross brand is synonymous with health care security and benefits, so it has an incredibly important legacy of taking care of the customer.
As part of that, we serve one in nine Americans who carry around one of our cards. The Blue Cross system overall has 100 million members.
So we have a great foundation for caring for our members. We have great networks and we’ve delivered excellent service. We’re a mission driven organization and that comes through in our interactions with the customer.
Where will growth come from?
There are about one million members who will age into Medicare every year between now and 2030 across the states in which we operate. We also recognize that with health care reform, even more will become eligible for Medicaid. As health care reform is fully implemented, there will be an estimated 30-plus million people who are currently uninsured who will gain eligibility and receive subsidies to get their health insurance from us through an exchange.
We have diversity through all of those segments, so we expect continued growth.
How do you define health care value and how are you focused around that value equation?
In terms of value, you have to think about cost without losing focus on quality and you have to ensure that procedures, services, and pharmaceuticals are used wisely in the process.
Part of our strategy is to make sure the customer ultimately gets a benefit that is affordable. We’ve reached a crisis level when it comes to affordability, which is part of what all of the reform efforts are intended to resolve. But to resolve it responsibly, we need to make sure we’re focusing on both cost and quality.
How critical is innovation and where are the greatest opportunities for innovation in this business?
There are obvious innovations, like our partnership with IBM using Watson technology – a relational, language-based artificial intelligence device – to create the first commercial application of Watson in health care. 
Health care studies have shown that evidence-based medicine is not followed as much as we would like. A RAND Study indicated that in only 55 percent of the time you seek and receive health care are you getting the evidence-based medicine that is indicated. Part of the reason it’s that low is that medicine is always changing and you can’t possibly keep up with all the latest information.
So we’re doing two “use cases”: the first is that we’re feeding our cases into Watson and it is being trained to assist our nurse case managers as they care for some of our most acutely ill members throughout the courses of their diseases.
The second use case is one in which we will partner with different physicians who will train Watson by feeding it additional real-world clinical expertise and it will then produce decision support for the physicians who are meeting the needs of our members.
So innovation is essential to creating health care value because if we can raise the use of evidence-based medicine from 55 percent to 95 percent, imagine how much more efficient and cost effective our system would be.
We have also developed a smart shopper assistance program where we help our members and their physicians “shop” the options to make sure their procedures are performed by vendors who have proven to be the highest quality and most effective at an affordable price. 
So we’ve done a lot of innovative things around health care reform but there is a lot about health care that is disconnected. Part of our unique opportunity is that we’re in the center of the equation – we have the data and information about our members and the providers, and we can use that data to meaningfully improve our members’ interactions in health care.
What needs to be done to improve the public’s trust of the health care system?
Studies have shown that members like their health insurance, but they don’t necessarily have a positive reaction to the industry as a whole. So we have to continue to focus on repeatedly satisfying our customers. That will not only foster their impression of us individually, but will also link to a better appreciation of the industry overall.
Perception has been so challenging for us to turn around because we are a disciplinarian in health care and that means that we have to point out to people that there are meaningful choices that should be made. We have to change the culture of people who, for many years, have not had enough transparency in either their health care benefits or their health care delivery. We’re partly responsible for having created a program where their employer paid the bill and the end-user/consumer never saw it.
So we have focused on transparency and making sure that our members have the information that they need when they’re engaging in the health care system, that it has both cost and quality information, and that it’s accessible.
Our tool, Anthem Care Comparison, covers 102 common procedures, so if you’re going to have an MRI of your spine, you know the options for where you can go and how much it will cost, and we’re getting ready to roll out an estimator of what your percentage of that cost will be.
That transparency will create more trust among the public and our members.•



Lori Beer



An Interview with Lori Beer, Executive Vice President-Enterprise Business Services, WellPoint, Inc.

Editors’ NoteLori Beer has more than 20 years of executive experience leading the delivery of strategic business solutions, 12 of those years with WellPoint. Her demonstrated success as CIO led her to the expanded role of chairing the Enterprise Portfolio Management Office as well as WellPoint’s Operations Council. Prior to serving as CIO, Beer held several posts with WellPoint. Beer has been recognized as a Computerworld 2011 Premier 100 IT Leader. She serves on the Board of Directors for Availity, L.L.C. and the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH). She earned a bachelor of science degree in computer science from the University of Dayton.
Would you provide an overview of the Enterprise Business Services unit?
Our goal is to optimize the services we provide for our customers. So we look at all the different components involved in providing a particular service – the technology required, the processes around that, the people required, etc. – and look at how we can provide that service more efficiently and effectively.
There are about 19,000 employees within Enterprise Business Services and a portion of those are in Service Operations. They are on the frontlines with our customers every day – answering phone calls from members and providers and helping them navigate the health care system.
The next area is Information Technology, which provides infrastructure and application development, but also helps use technology to drive innovation.
The third organization is Information Management. We have data in this company on more than 34 million members. Information Management turns that data into useful information and actionable insight that allows us to take better care of our members.
Another part of the organization is the Sourcing and Supplier organization, which handles procurement.
We also have an Operational Excellence team, which focuses on bringing all the pieces together. Our Enterprise Project Management office runs 300 concurrent projects implementing new strategic initiatives and Operational Excellence helps organize the project and monitors its leadership to ensure the execution of that strategic initiative.
A recent addition to our organization is our Federal Government Solutions Unit, where we provide benefits and processing services for the Federal Employee Program, and National Government Services, serving as a claims processor for Medicare. Much of this work is operationally focused, looking at how we streamline and optimize, so it made sense bringing it together with the rest of Enterprise Business Services.
My team has responsibility for executing and delivering for our customers every day, for integrating the products and services, and delivering value – that is the core focus.•



Dr. Harlan Levine



An Interview with Dr. Harlan Levine, Executive Vice President-Comprehensive Health Solutions, WellPoint, Inc.

Editors’ NoteDr. Harlan Levine has more than 15 years of experience providing clinical health management, consultative services, and program implementation support to businesses and organizations of all sizes, across a broad range of industries. Dr. Levine earned his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco and is board certified in Internal Medicine. Prior to pursuing his medical career, he attended Harvard College, where he received his Bachelor of Science degree in biology.
Would you highlight the capabilities of WellPoint’s Comprehensive Health Solutions (CHS)?
Comprehensive Health Solutions is a collection of capabilities and businesses that span from network contracting to medical or care management, pharmacy management, behavioral management, and EAP services. We also have a research entity.
We recognize that these capabilities need to be integrated to deliver the best health care value for our customers – that is our purpose. We have 7,000 associates who are all dedicated to improving quality, safety, and affordability.
We operate in 14 states and, from a provider contracting point of view, we have best-in-class value contracts across our network. From a care management point of view, we have accumulated a vast information asset that provides insights that have not only helped us manage care across the entire continuum from wellness to illness, but also has an analytic tool that does ongoing surveillance of the population. It looks for gaps in care where our evidence shows that, according to industry-standard evidence-based medicine, there may be opportunities to improve the care of our members. We’re able to identify that and deliver messages to both the consumer and the physician.
So we have the people, technology, and capabilities that, when you put them all together, comprise an industry leading aggregation of assets.
How critical is innovation to the culture here and how deep does it permeate?
I came here because of the uniqueness of CHS. At WellPoint, we have scale and deep local presence. That’s important because being innovative means change and change can be potentially disruptive to the market. We’re actually relevant to the delivery system and we’re able to deliver these changes.
There is also a strong sense of accountability on this team. Between the deep market presence and the culture of holding ourselves accountable for making a difference, it’s fertile ground for that innovative spirit.
People who are senior leaders in CHS are here because they feel that we’re the company in the best position to make a difference. We believe that if we don’t make changes, we’re going to fall behind in the market. And if any company can help bring affordability and quality to health care in the future, it’s WellPoint. That drives our innovation every day.•



Randy Brown



An Interview with Randy Brown, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, WellPoint, Inc.

Editors’ NoteBefore joining WellPoint in June of 2001, Randy Brown served in a variety of human resources leadership roles for RCA, GE, and Thomson Multimedia. Brown received a Bachelor of Arts degree, Summa Cum Laude, in economics from Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He is a member of the Society for Human Resource Management and WorldatWork organizations.
How successful have you been in attracting and retaining the talent you need?
We feel good that our retention rate, in an industry with very high turnover, is more than 90 percent on an annual basis. Our associate engagement scores, which denote those who feel energized about being here, are also higher than industry benchmarks. So it’s not just that people stay but that they feel energized about the contribution they make.
How important are diversity and inclusion to the culture of WellPoint?
Diversity and inclusion are different but equally important. You can have a diverse workforce but there can still be a feeling that people aren’t fully included. So creating the right representation and diversity in your workforce is step one, but you also have to create a culture where people can be themselves. We want people to bring their whole selves to work to express different points of view. That richness helps us to be more aligned with and reflective of our customer base.
How has the role of an HR leader evolved and how critical is executive involvement?
The reason we’re here is to further the business of WellPoint and we do that by teaching the organization good HR practices and role-modeling them ourselves.
What I enjoy about WellPoint is that, regardless of our function, when we’re at Angela’s (Braly) table, we’re free to contribute on all matters. So I want my counterparts to contribute to the shaping of HR policy; similarly, I’m free to talk about non-HR matters and that’s what makes this leadership team vibrant and fun.
From an employment point of view, will there be a new model in the future?
Productivity is going to be key for many years to come and organizations have learned how to be more effective and efficient, and to operate with flatter organizational structures – that trend is here to stay. But what we’re all striving for is growth, because with that comes new jobs and opportunities.
While this industry does so much good, public perception of it is not always favorable. Are young people aware of the impact that can be made in this industry?
What young people understand is the huge opportunity to affect the health of the American workforce and population. People know the U.S. has obesity problems and health-related issues, sometimes driven by our own behaviors. To the extent that new entrants into the workforce know that health plans can make a difference in improving people’s lives, they get more interested.•

Angela Braly, an attorney by trade, served as CEO of health insurer WellPoint Inc. from 2007 to 2012, when she resigned amid pressure from shareholders. Named by Forbes as one of the most powerful women in the world for most of her tenure at WellPoint, Braly has continued serving in corporate boardrooms since her departure, albeit with a lower profile. She’s also invested more time in charitable and community endeavors.

 (IBJ photo/Daniel Axler)

IBJ: I’ll venture a guess that a lot of our readers have been wondering what you’ve been up to the last couple of years and may even be surprised you’re still in Indianapolis. Why did you stick around?

BRALY: Indianapolis is our home and we’ve been here now almost 10 years. Our kids have gone to school here, we’ve made friends, and we feel like we’re part of the community. There was no debate about it. I’ve had great success here and I want to give back to the community.

IBJ: According to Forbes, you were the fourth-most-powerful woman in the world in 2008. Do you prefer influence a little more out of the public view?

BRALY: I do. I was so honored and grateful to have that opportunity and to lead WellPoint, and to get all that recognition. I’m enjoying influencing and making things happen and not being the tip of the spear as much.

IBJ: You haven’t left the corporate life altogether. You serve on the boards of Procter & Gamble [since 2009] and Lowe’s [since 2013]. What do you see as your role on those boards?

BRALY: I do think because my history included being a general counsel and CEO, [that] gives me an interesting perspective to add. Specifically, I used to serve boards of directors. Boards play a very important role. They don’t manage a company, but they’re actively involved in strategy, risk and talent.

IBJ: Do board meetings ever get heated or are they mostly cordial?

BRALY: Board meetings by definition should be more than just a cordial discussion. They should be engaged and active.

IBJ: Board service must also be a fantastic networking and learning opportunity. The P&G board you serve on includes the CEOs of American Express, Boeing, Macy’s and Hewlett Packard.

BRALY: It’s an incredible group of people, and an incredible company. Frankly, A.G. Lafley [Procter & Gamble’s chairman and CEO] is the best businessperson I’ve ever seen in action. He’s so strategic and so analytical and such a great leader. I’ve learned so much from him.

IBJ: Is there a specific lesson you learned from him?

BRALY: It’s really important for CEOs to have deep understanding of each of the elements of your business—in the P&G context, knowing each category, each product, how it works in each geography.

	The other thing at P&G and Lowe’s: They know the consumer. That was the reason I chose to join the P&G board when I was still at WellPoint. I really felt like health care was going to go to the consumer. And I thought: Who is the best in the world at serving a consumer? Procter & Gamble.

IBJ: Do you have any advice for a first-time board member?

BRALY: My advice: Be on the audit committee. I’m on the audit committee for both Lowe’s and Procter & Gamble. I think that’s the best place to understand the business.

IBJ: What can government learn from business?

BRALY: The thing that’s most obvious is that companies, government agencies, volunteer organizations probably all have an opportunity to be more efficient and effective at what they do. You really have to look at the work that’s getting done and decide if that’s where the value is.

	It’s rarely the person who’s doing the least valuable thing in an organization that says, “I don’t have to do my job. This thing I’m doing is not that valuable.” You have to have a way to evaluate what is the most effective in meeting your goal. I think those principles apply in frankly any group or organizations of human beings who come together and achieve a goal.

IBJ: Have you ever considered politics?

BRALY: I’m happy to support others who feel that is their calling. I don’t see it as mine. I’m working with other women who are running for office and are serving publicly.

IBJ: What have you learned the last few years?

BRALY: I feel like I’ve learned from successes along the way, and failures. People make mistakes, and I made some. My encouragement to people, particularly women in business or aspiring to be in government, is: Know who you are. That’s really important because other people will try to tell you who you should be. Make sure you take risks. There’s a big conversation about women now—do they have the confidence they need or take the risks that they need? Much is lost for want of asking. You’ve gotta ask for the tough assignment, really go for it, and be willing to take that risk.

	But ultimately, every job ... is about serving other people. I was a lawyer and I took care of my clients, I was a CEO and took care of my customers, and I’m a board member and take care of ultimately the shareholders and customers.

IBJ: We had ground rules to not talk about WellPoint [thanks to her severance agreement]. Is there some point in the future where you’ll talk more about what happened?

BRALY: It’s kind of like ancient history. I’m so proud of that company. I’m so proud of what they’re doing. I think some of the strategies being executed on that are really great. We bought some really important companies, and they’re being really well run. There’s new leadership there, and I need to be respectful that they’re running the company. I had a wonderful opportunity to do that during my time there.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
