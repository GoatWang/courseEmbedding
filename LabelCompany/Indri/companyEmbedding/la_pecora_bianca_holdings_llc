NYMag’sReview




Hours &details



 



On the surface, La Pecora Bianca seems like yet another breezy Italian restaurant, with a menu that includes organic pasta, grass-fed meat, vegetable dishes utilizing seasonal produce, and, of course, several different Negroni options. Lovely, for sure, but not exactly reinventing the wheel. What makes this place noteworthy is its all-star team: Restaurateur Mark Barak has already created a bona fide hit with Claudette, and he's brought on Simone Bonelli, who grew up in Modena and worked as Massimo Bottura's sous-chef at Osteria Francescana.

Bonelli is making all the pastas in house, and the selection includes spaghetti with pomodoro sauce, tagliatelle with beef and pork Bolognese, and tortelloni with fava bean, sheep’s milk ricotta, and mint.

The 85-seat space—designed by Nema Workshop and Chira de Rege Interiors and formerly home to the Havana Tobacco Company—is bright and vibrant. The designers wanted to retain some of the historical elements, and they've restored a white-marble staircase that once led to the cigar humidor. Overall, there's an Italian-farmhouse vibe, with terra cotta, wood-plank tables, and hand-painted wall tiles, and an espresso bar that transitions into an apertivo bar at night.

“Can't wait to go back”


Reviewed October 22, 2015



via mobile




This restaurant is everything I enjoy about dining in New York..it's spacious but filled with warm decorative details that make it feel cozy, has a big bar and wait area perfect for people watching, not to mention the food is delicious. Ordering was tough because everything on the menu sounds appealing! But we had the funghi (yum) and cipolle (double yum) to start, and the seasonal risotto and scallops as main dishes. I loved it all and will definitely be going back to try the rest!

“Bizarre "Italian" Food”


Reviewed October 20, 2015




My husband is from Torino so when we arrived at this restaurant suggested by our friend and lawyer, who is also a foodie, we looked forward to trying this hot new eatery (my husband is always happy to have delicious Italian food--well, any delicious food regardless of where it comes from). The place was heaving with people and our friend admitted he had never been there but it had gotten a lot of buzz since it opened two weeks ago. From the service you could tell it was a newly opened establishment. It was pretty rough (as one reviewer already pointed out), the maitre d' screamed at us for being late (in both English and Italian) although our friend showed up early. Our waiter told us how we had to read the menu, I refused and he didn't like it. I still resisted, I'm literate and can manage to read on my own and listen to his suggestions at the same time. All of this we could tolerate, if and only if, the food was incredible. But it wasn't. It was far from it. We each ordered two courses and one dessert and we tried each others' food, and each was truly bizarre. Some were bizarre in a not-so-bad way, but others were bizarre in the way that you either A) want to gag or B) wish you never stepped foot in this place. It's been years that we had such a horrific experience. We were perplexed as the place was packed. I asked my husband, "Do you think they all ordered the good things and we order the bad things?" But he pointed out that we ordered a number of things, even those which the waiter suggested, and they were all bad (including the parmigiano creme brulee--DO NOT ORDER). I asked my husband if he felt that they were focusing on specific region's cuisine, his reply: "No it's just bad and I don't know which region would create food so bad." I googled it and we laughed, to summarize the restaurant's about page, it's local Italian from the Hudson Valley. So if anyone is interested in A) Sheep's Milk products and B) pricy Italian-Hudson Valley food then this is *the* place is for you. For anyone who likes real Italian food, da evitare a tutti i costi (translate: to avoid at all costs).

“Wonderful Service and great food”


Reviewed October 14, 2015




There is a wonderful energy and vibe to this place which is just off Madison Square Park on Broadway. The room is bright and nicely decorated. There is a bar as you enter but also one by the kitchen in back that looks fun to sit at. The service was very attentive and knowledgeable about wine pairings. Even though crowded they did not rush you at all. As for food the strozzapreti with pistachios and lemon as well as the onion side dish are superb. Would definitely go back.

“Give It Another Month, It will be great”


Reviewed October 11, 2015




Another new place that has been getting a lot of great press. It's never a good idea to go to a new restaurant soon after it opens because it takes practice to make perfect. The service was attentive, but quite rough around the edges. Most importantly, though, was the food which did not need more practice at all. Both the appetizers and the pasta were just outstanding. We had the crispy octopus ( a new take on a pretty trite dish) and the roasted figs. Both were great. All the pastas were excellent although they could have been served slightly hotter. Always a difficult problem with pasta. Definitely worth trying either for a full dinner, or just to stop in for some wine and a bowl of pasta. The only risk of waiting for them to work out the kinks is that as word spreads I predict this will become a real hot spot that is difficult to get in.
