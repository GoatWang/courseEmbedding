Partnership of Duke Energy with Carbon Cycle Energy for renewable energy in North Carolina







Share 






 







By Simon Lefebvre | 2016-04-12
Political incentives such as mandatory compliances are one of the strongest catalyzers for transition, and this is also true for renewable energy. Even if the environmental benefits are obvious, it must be said that the economic return of renewable energy, especially in the short term, is not as interesting as with fossil fuels considering their higher energy potential. Fortunately, as the population concerns for the environment and its sustainability has led to greater interest in this field by the public sector, big corporations are becoming increasingly green in order to ease their social recognition and satisfy political mandatory compliances. A good example is the Renewable Energy and Energy Portfolio Standard (REPS), which mainly explains the partnership of Duke Energy with Carbon Cycle Energy for renewable energy in North Carolina.
The REPS dates back to 2007 when North Carolina officialised it on August 20th to become the first southeastern state of the U.S. to adopt such a measure. This law requires corporations producing and selling utilities, such as electricity, that renewable energy accounts for 12.5% of their energy needs. Specifically concerning electricity, power suppliers can comply with the REPS by various ways, like producing or purchasing, for new or existing facilities, electricity coming from all types of renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermic, ocean current, wave energy or any biomass resource like organic residual waste, animal waste, agricultural waste, etc.
Therefore, North Carolina’s REPS is behind the partnership between Duke Energy (DE), the biggest electricity provider in the U.S. with 7.4 million customers, and Carbon Cycle Energy (C2e), a renewable energy project development company specialized in biogas. Their joint project consists of a 15-year term during which C2e, who will build and own the anaerobic digestion plant, is expected to generate over 1 million MMBtus (approximately 28 million cubic meters) per year of high-quality biomethane (refined biogas). C2e’s biomethane production will then be purchased by DE in order to supply about 125,000 megawatt-hours of electricity to four of its energy production plants. For the record, this is enough to fulfill 10,000 households in electricity for a year in this area. Also, the plant which is expected to start running by mid-2017 will generate 40 to 50 jobs for its operations.
It follows that biogas has an obvious sustainable energy potential, based on its economic viability, environmental benefits as well as the social involvement it induces related to the revaluation of organic residual waste. Though, in order to develop biogas as a major part of the global sustainability solution, a push emanating from the political sphere will be necessary for every country. As we can see with the DE and C2e partnership in North Carolina, the compliances required by the REPS are one of the main motivations behind the project.
Elsewhere, comparable patterns are making their way through, such as in the province of Quebec, Canada. Indeed, their recently launched 2030-oriented Energy Policy is aimed towards sustainability, notably by fossil fuels reduction as well as renewable energy production and transition. The province will be devoted to encouraging this transition by setting, inter alia, mandatory compliances to certain types of energy. In short, it is evident that the public sector has the power to regulate in order to reach global objectives in terms of sustainable development, renewable energy, and climate change. Governments should, as a duty, be using more this power because it works, even if there is a powerful lobby by the fossil industry.

Energy>Waste-to-Energy Agricultural WTE Projects Taking Shape in North Carolina and Oregon
Megan Greenwalt, Cheryl McMullen | Apr 04, 2016


































New technologies are fueling innovation in the waste-to-energy field. Two recent developments are set to bring projects online in North Carolina and Oregon based on taking agricultural waste and turning it into different kinds of energy.
In North Carolina, Charlotte-based electric power holding company Duke Energy recently signed a deal with Carbon Cycle Energy (C2e) to buy swine and poultry waste output from its facility planned for eastern North Carolina using the captured methane gas to generate renewable electricity at four power stations. C2e, headquartered in Boulder, Colo., will build and own the facility.
C2e will deliver more than 1 million MMBtus of pipeline-quality methane a year. Duke Energy should yield about 125,000 megawatt-hours of renewable energy a year—enough to power about 10,000 homes for a year. The renewable energy credits (RECs) generated annually will help satisfy state mandates for electricity produced from swine and poultry waste.
“One of the goals of the swine-derived biogas requirement in (Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard) REPS is to assists the North Carolina pork industry with development of ways to manage animal wastes,” says Thomas Mulholland, executive vice president of energy trading and risk management for C2e. “We are delighted that this project will do that, and in turn serve not only Duke Energy, but also the pork industry and the state of North Carolina.”
According to North Carolina's REPS, Duke Energy companies must meet specific compliance targets for swine and poultry waste. Duke Energy is already buying electricity generated from other facilities in the state.
“Under North Carolina’s renewable energy mandate, Duke Energy must generate 0.2 percent of its electricity from swine waste by the year 2021. This helps us along to comply with the goal,” says Randy Wheeless, corporate communications manager for Duke Energy.
Mulholland says C2e produces methane gas through a technique that mimics nature’s way of breaking down organic matter.
“Naturally occurring microbes present within digestive tracts of animals perform a biological decomposition process that converts biomass into methane, other gases and residual fibers,” he says. “C2e harnesses this process by installing digesters to do the same function—to convert biomass on a large scale into biogas. Downstream of the digester system, we purify crude biogas to meet to customer quality specifications, and inject it into a pipeline for delivery to Duke Energy.”
Mulholland says this approach can be utilized in many areas of the U.S.
“Some areas of the country have high concentrations of animal production, which can create large volumes of animal waste,” he says. “Our North Carolina project will use animal waste as feedstock for our digesters, making beneficial use of a resource out of place. We believe this approach could be applied widely.”
Duke Energy views this process as carbon-free energy, according to Wheeless.
“The air emissions from using the fuel at our plants are no greater than if the waste was left to decay naturally. That’s a good story, he says. “However, this process is more expensive than traditional sources. It’s even more expensive than renewable sources like solar power. Hopefully, new projects will bring the costs down.”
Mulholland says he sees the project as a win-win-win.
“The big benefit is to take a waste product, which we view as a resource out of place, and convert it into a useable fuel. By doing this, we’ll reduce harmful fugitive methane emissions, reduce odors, and reduce a part of Duke Energy’s fossil fuel consumption,” he says.
Farm Waste into Fuel in Oregon
Meanwhile, with support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Minneapolis-based Novus Energy, LLC will build a $20.2 million biorefinery in Boardman, Ore. to process agricultural waste into fuels, fertilizer and clean water.
Using waste from onion and potato processing plants, dairy manure, seasonal plant by-products and other waste supplied by local growers and processors as the primary feedstock Novus Energy plans to turn the waste into fuel, natural gas, organic fertilizer and other biobased products.
The biorefinery will be built on land owned by the Port of Morrow, one of the largest ports in Oregon.
Novus Energy’s proprietary technology, Novus Bio-Catalytic Conversion (NBC) System, is an integrated, bio-catalytic process that converts organic feedstocks to a variety of high-value products in one location. The process converts waste into valuable “green” products and recovers clean water while eliminating pollution caused by the burning and dumping of agricultural and organic waste.
The NBC process separates digestion products into clean biogas (hydrocarbons) and organic fertilizer (non-hydrocarbons and micro nutrients). The high-energy content biogas can be used as a fuel on site in lieu of fossil fuels or be further processed into renewable liquid fuels. The biogas is free from contaminants and does not require extensive cleaning.
And, the company already has a buyer for the biogas.
“We are working with BP,” says Burke. “They are in the market for renewable natural gas. We generate biogas, we compress it and clean it and convert it into renewable natural gas. We have an agreement with Cascade Natural Gas. So we’ll put into their pipeline and at the injection point, BP buys it from them and transports it to their customers.”
Novus Energy’s NBC gas production services use solid feedstocks, such as potato peels, straw, corn stover and sugar beet pulp, and forest products which, while abundant and inexpensive, are difficult to digest through standard anaerobic digestion. Many months are typically required to thoroughly digest these substrates. Burke says the NBC process digests these materials more completely and in much less time than traditional methods. The process enables a plant to realize significantly higher conversions in smaller volumes.
This is of great interest to potential buyers, says Burke. Following blind studies and a white paper on the technology, Burke says the reaction of potential customers was the same: “While it sounds great, where can I go see that?”
Novus then built a trailer that allowed it to take the technology to interested customers.
“Not only can you go see it, but we’ll bring it to you where we can operate it on your waste stream,” Burke says. “So that was the first demonstration plant on a mobile platform. And it was pretty unique.”
With the new plant, things will change. The Oregon plant will be the company’s first full-scale commercial plant.
Not only will it produce the biogas, but it also will use the digestate, a waste product of the process itself, to make a mineral-rich liquid natural fertilizer.
The initial buyer for the fertilizer is a Raymond, Wash.,-based company called Pacific Gro, which sells its own fertilizer products and distributes others.
“So they’ll use our fertilizer to enhance some of their products and sell it stand alone,” says Burke.
The new plant will act as an intercept plant for the Port of Morrow, where it will take a couple of waste streams from the port and giving them back cleaner water, he says.
“Today water as a commodity is cheap. Some day that will change and there will be more economic value for clean water,” Burke says.
USDA is supporting the project with an $11 million loan guarantee through the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program, says Burke, which gives Novus Energy little risk on the loan. Novus is working with an Oregon lender, Old West Federal Credit Union, to finance the project. USDA hopes to finalize loan terms with Novus and Old West by summer.
“So depending on your equity to debt ratio, it establishes how much USDA will back, and in our instance they’ll back 90 percent of the loan.”
USDA has put its stamp of approval on the project.
“USDA is proud to support innovative, biobased projects such as this one,” Rural Development Under Secretary Lisa Mensah said in a press release. “This biorefinery will spur economic development, create new jobs and provide new markets for farm commodities in rural Oregon.”
On a daily basis, the plant is expected to generate 3.8 million cubic feet of renewable natural gas, 350 gallons of liquid fertilizer, and 11.2 tons of material that can improve soil physically or chemically to make it more suitable for plant growth. The facility also is expected to return approximately 172,000 gallons of treated water to the Port of Morrow daily. 
Novus Energy expects to hire up to 10 people to operate and maintain the plant and indirectly create another 15 to 20 support jobs. Burke says the company could break ground on the new plant this summer.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.
