    Investment Strategy - Thomas H. Lee Partners


	
  




























Investment Strategy


Industry Expertise






Home:
Investment Strategy



Investment Strategy
Growth Businesses
 We invest in growth-oriented businesses with strong free cash flow
characteristics, driven more by secular growth trends than overall
GDP growth. We seek to grow our portfolio companies both
organically and through acquisitions. Organically, we invest in
resources to expand into new products, new markets, new geographies
and new channels of distribution. We also look for platforms in
fragmented industries where we can accelerate growth through
acquisitions. We typically invest in companies with enterprise
values between $250 million and $2.5 billion.

Industry Expertise
 We focus on companies in three core sectors with attractive
secular growth: Business & Financial Services, Consumer &
Healthcare, and Media, Information Services & Technology.
Approximately 85% of the capital invested during the firm's 40-year
history has been deployed in these three sectors. Through decades
of experience, we have developed deep industry expertise, knowledge
and relationships, which we believe make us better investors and
better partners for management.

Operationally-Intensive Approach
 Our teams of investment and operating professionals partner with
portfolio company management to identify and implement
organizational, operational and strategic improvements and to
accelerate sustainable revenue and profit growth. We bring
expertise in critical areas such as pricing and sales force
optimization, business process reengineering, IT system and
management, supply chain management and procurement and healthcare
plan design. We strive to build great companies of
lasting value and to generate superior investment
returns.

 North America
 We invest in companies headquartered primarily in North America,
where we can leverage the strength of our network of relationships
in the region. The businesses are are generally global in scope,
with operations and resources around the world to capitalize on
international growth opportunities. International expansion is
frequently an important component of our value creation plan. We
believe expanding geographically from a North American base can
provide access to global growth with lower risk than investing
directly in international markets.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

THL to make 2.2x its investment with Fogo de Chao IPO


June 10, 2015
By Luisa Beltran
 Follow @LuisaRBeltran




 


Thomas H. Lee Partners LP stands to more than double its money once Fogo de Chao Inc goes public.
The Brazilian steakhouse plans to price its offering on June 18 and start trading the next day, a source said. Fogo is offering 4.4 million shares at $16 to $18 each via book runners Jefferies and JP Morgan.
THL owns 92 percent of Fogo and has no plans to sell shares in the IPO. At $17 a share, THL stands to make $379.5 million in paper gains, or 2.2x its money.
THL acquired Fogo de Chao in July 2012 in a deal valued at $400 million. The THL-led group invested $172.1 million equity into the deal, SEC filings indicate. Since being sold to THL, Fogo de Chao doesn’t appear to have paid out any dividends.
Fogo de Chao plans to use proceeds from the IPO to pay off debt. The company has $314 million in total liabilities, which includes about $238 million in long-term debt.
Founded in 1979 in Brazil, Fogo de Chao — which means “campfire” or “fire on the ground” in Portuguese — specializes in fire-roasting meats using a centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique called churrasco. The Dallas-based company currently operates 26 restaurants in the United States, 10 in Brazil and one in Mexico.
Fogo de Chao is profitable. Revenue rose nearly 20 percent to $262.3 million in 2014. Income also rose to $17.3 million for the year, up from $937 million in losses in 2013, according to a June 8 regulatory filing.
THL’s investment came from its sixth fund, which closed at $8.1 billion in 2007. The pool is producing a 6.9 percent net IRR and a 1.4x investment multiple as of Sept. 30, according to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.
THL is fundraising for its seventh pool, which has a $3 billion target, and has drawn $1.5 billion in commitments so far, PE HUB sister publication Buyouts reported in March.
Executives for THL and Fogo de Chao declined comment.
